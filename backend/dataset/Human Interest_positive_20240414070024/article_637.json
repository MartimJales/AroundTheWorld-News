    "text": "New Orleans East gets $65.5 million for bike lanes and pedestrian bridges A $61 million grant designed to improve transit and pedestrian safety is coming to New Orleans East. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, led the effort to get federal funding for the area. It coincides with continued efforts to redevelop Lincoln Beach, \"One of my greatest joys is to continue to shovel millions of dollars back home for meaningful projects and programs that will make our communities better and safer,\" says Carter. Representative Carter says he and New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas have worked hand-in-hand to continue providing New Orleans East with the resources it needs. \"Just a major award by Congressman Carter; we've been talking about it for quite some time. New Orleans East getting the attention it deserves, the rebranding it deserves, but also the resources it deserves,\" says Thomas. Federal money from the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods Program will make improvements by constructing shared-use trails along the north and south i-10 service roads, trail connections at existing interchanges and a non-motorized bridge. \"Additionally, an additional $4 million to build the bridge over to access Lincoln Beach. Now, we've sent several million before on other parts of Lincoln Beach in eastern New Orleans, but this next part really is literally and figuratively the bridge that will allow us to get to the next phase,\" says Carter. The proposed 250-foot pedestrian bridge would take beachgoers from a future parking lot on the south side of Hayne Boulevard, over the busy highway, railroad tracks and floodwall, to the water. In 2022, a feasibility study was done to identify projects along the i-10 corridor to improve safety and mobility for people walking, bicycling and using transit. Thomas says this project will build new connections and provide the economic boost that his district needs and deserves. \"New Orleans East shouldn't be treated any different from any place else,\" said Thomas. \"Especially one of the largest populations of homeownership in the state.\" Once funding agreements are finalized, an environmental review and project design effort will follow before construction begins.",

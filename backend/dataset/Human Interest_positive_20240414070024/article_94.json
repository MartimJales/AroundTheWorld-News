    "text": "SS Rajamouli's Oscar-winning film, RRR, is making headlines yet again. The film will be played in Japan on March 18, and advance ticketing for the special event begins on March 13. The tickets to the performance sold out in less than a minute. As previously reported, SS Rajamouli will visit the event in Japan next week. The official X (previously Twitter) of 'RRR' stated that the film has been playing in Japanese cinemas for the last year and a half. Their post read, \"It's been close to 1.5 years since the theatrical release in Japan. Since then, it's still running in theatres, and the show on March 18 sold out in less than a minute. Absolute RRRAMPAGE... #RRRinJapan #RRRMovie (sic).\" Also Read:Sobhita Dhulipala looks dreamy as she drops HOT pictures in bridal look In October 2022, the 'RRR' team advertised the film in Japan.

Now that the pandemic limitations have been lifted, SS Rajamouli plans to go to Japan to attend the screening of 'RRR' on March 18. The film will be played at Shinjuku Wald 9 and Shinjuku Piccadilly. Aside from attending the screening, SS Rajamouli will engage with the Japanese audience.

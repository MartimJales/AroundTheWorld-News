    "text": "5 for Good: Lowell charity named St. Jude volunteer group of the year Fitness for a Cure celebrates 25 years supporting St. Jude with annual performance Fitness for a Cure celebrates 25 years supporting St. Jude with annual performance Fitness for a Cure celebrates 25 years supporting St. Jude with annual performance At [Dragonfly Cafe](https://www.dragonflycafe.org/) in Lowell, Massachusetts, the menu features delicious, healthful, gluten-free food. Sherri Sarouff owns the cafe with her son Stephen, and [SLS Fitness](https://www.slsfitness.com/), a gym down the road. \"I'm really passionate about movement and healthy food and holistic care,\" she said. The Sarouff family is also passionate about supporting St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Twenty-five years ago, Sherri started a one-of-a-kind fundraising effort to benefit the hospital. She said the healthy birth of her daughter, Elizabeth, after a difficult pregnancy got her thinking. \"Maybe I could do an event; it would be a fitness event,” she said.” Fun and exciting with a lot of energy, and maybe we'd talk about St. Jude.\" She said she recruited a handful of kids, her children’s friends. She taught them a dance routine, and Fitness for a Cure was born. To date, Sherri said the event has raised more than $8,000,000 for St. Jude. No family is ever billed at St. Jude. Donations fund research and care. Donations are raised by groups like Fitness for a Cure. These days, both Elizabeth and Stephen Sarouff co-chair the annual event. They haven't missed a beat since childhood. More than 100 kids take part in weekly practices and fundraise ahead of the big show. \"It's funny because I don't remember a time without it,” Stephen said. “(It’s) what I did my whole life…the day of the show would come, and it would be my favorite day of the year. (It’s) still is my favorite day of the year.\" \"I wouldn't be the person I am today without growing up with St. Jude,” Elizabeth said. \"You get this deep sense of empathy and perspective that I don't think you would get growing up without some philanthropic work or being involved with a cause like this.\" Fitness for a Cure was recently named St. Jude's Volunteer Group of the Year. The annual show is Saturday, March 16, at Lowell Memorial Auditorium. Find more information [here](https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/find-an-event/dinners-and-galas/fitness-for-a-cure.html).",

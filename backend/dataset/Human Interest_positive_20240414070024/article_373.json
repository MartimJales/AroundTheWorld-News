    "text": "Kelly Clarkson shocks Jimmy Fallon with 'filthy' Pictionary drawing: 'Badminton!' It's not very likely that [Kelly Clarkson](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/02/01/kelly-clarkson-prediabetic-weight-loss/72435260007/) will ever be asked to join the Pictionary Hall of Fame – especially not after what happened on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon. Clarkson made an appearance on the show Wednesday with Peyton Manning and Mike Tirico, who will join her as hosts for the [2024 Olympic Games ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/03/13/kelly-clarkson-and-peyton-manning-join-nbc-s-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-coverage-as-hosts/72953518007/)opening ceremony set to take place in Paris later this year. The trio was invited to participate in a friendly game of \"Olympictionary,\" an Olympics-themed version of Pictionary. Clarkson, who was asked to draw first, warned Fallon: “Oh, my gosh. I can’t draw.” Still she proceeds to pick a word and gets “ [shuttlecock](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shuttlecock),” which is a the conical object with a rounded, often rubber-covered nose that is used in the sport badminton. It's also often called a \"birdie.\" It turns out, Clarkson did not know what the projectile was called because her drawing went a totally different, NSFW direction. Watch the hilarious moment below. Fallon recognizes Clarkson’s skittish behavior, saying to her “You’re having a meltdown.\" She tells Fallon it's an object, saying she’s unsure “this (drawing) can be aired.” Clarkson, unsure how to draw the clue, opts to draw a [penis](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/08/07/penis-men-afraid-talk-average-size/70468460007/) for part two of the word. Her drawing is immediately blurred out, with Clarkson flailing her arms in embarrassment. “I’m so sorry, Mom” Clarkson tells the camera as Fallon moves to take his coat off. “I mean, if you drew it smaller, I would know what it is,” Fallon jokes. Fallon continues to guess based on the drawing, throwing out rocket ship, stadium and Goodyear blimp train as Clarkson tries to draw a shuttle, part one of the word. The buzzer rings, letting Fallon know he’s out of guesses. “I don’t know what else to say. I can’t say. It’s filthy. I don’t know what it is,\" Fallon says. “What in the world could that be?” Fallon asks. Manning steps in to offer a guess, revealing the correct answer. But Fallon just couldn't get over the drawing gone wild. “You couldn’t draw a tennis racket? Badminton! Badminton. Badminton. You just draw the filthiest thing. You’re America’s sweetheart. We’re both America’s sweetheart. And we did the dirtiest thing we’ve ever done in the history of our career,” Fallon jokes.",

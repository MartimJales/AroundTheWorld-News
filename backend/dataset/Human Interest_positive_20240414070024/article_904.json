    "text": "Free agent tight end Irv Smith Jr. said quite a few draws led him to sign a one-year deal with the Kansas City Chiefs.\nPlaying alongside quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. Getting to be coached by Andy Reid.\nAnd also being able to join a team that’s had plenty of recent success.\n“The culture that they’ve built here, it’s a winning culture, and it’s something that ... I’ve been around winning my whole life,” Smith said Thursday during an interview with reporters. “I just felt like for me, it was the best opportunity, the best fit and somewhere I can succeed and just showcase my ability.”\nSmith, 25, signed with KC on a one-year contract worth $1.292 million. Smith profiles as the Chiefs’ third tight end behind Kelce and Noah Gray, though the team has historically used multiple-tight-end sets more than many other franchises.\n“At the end of the day, we’re going to be getting each other open,” Smith said, “and feeding off of each other.”\n A 2019 second-round draft pick of the Vikings, Smith played three years in Minnesota before spending this past season with Cincinnati. He played in 12 games last season and had 18 catches for 115 yards and a touchdown while missing some time with a hamstring injury.\nAilments have also cut short previous seasons. Smith missed most of 2022 with the Vikings after suffering a high ankle sprain.\nSmith admitted Thursday this offseason has been the first in three years where he’s been able to train at full health.\n“That’s my main goal is just to be 100% as much as I can,” Smith said, “and to be available.”\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2024 The Kansas City Star.

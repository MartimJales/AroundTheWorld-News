    "text": "According to fans, FSU Football in for a most interesting spring camp\nWith under a week to go until 2024 FSU football spring camp — at last! — we posed a simple straw poll question to Warchant subscribers\non our Tribal Council message board: What one player are you most excited to read about and hear about this spring?\nThe answers paint a fun picture.\nSure, it’s no surprise that quarterback\nDJ Uiagalelei earned the most votes of any player. Any time a program turns the reins over to a transfer quarterback, let alone one as experienced as Uiagalelei, intrigue will be high.\nBut as of Thursday morning, across 21 responses in the thread, 14 different players were named.\nThink about that for a moment. Two-thirds of the responses called for updates on different players. That is the definition of a highly interesting camp ahead.\nOnly three players earned multiple votes: Uiagalelei (six), receiver\nHykeem Williams (two) and linebacker Shawn Murphy (two). Of the 14 players named, Warchant subscribers picked nine players on FSU’s offense and five on the defensive side.\nHere are some of our favorite responses from our subscribers, with some light edits for clarity.\nQB DJ Uiagalelei\n“Offense goes as he does.” — FSUDoles\n“He’s replacing Jordan and it’s the most important position on the field. Has his accuracy improved? Can he effectively run the playbook?” — Dave 393\n“Most important player.” — FSUkenny\nWR Hykeem Williams\n“He looks jacked on his Instagram today. He’s putting in this work. Hope to see it pay off this coming year.” — NoleCab30\n“I want to see what he does with more reps and another year in the weight and film rooms.” — LastFrontierNole\nLB Shawn Murphy\n“I want to see\nDJ Lundy take the next step in his progression but we know he’s mostly a run stuffer and not great in coverage. Need another LB to step up alongside him.” — Rulli4FSU\nDT Darrell Jackson\n“Darrell Jackson. We need an All-ACC year from this guy to shore up the middle of the defense. Also will be a huge asset to our LB’s if he’s doing his thing.” — NoleBiz\nEDGE Sione Lolohea\n“Payton obviously has one of the edge spots tied down. Lolohea is coming in as a fifth-year SR and he was 2nd team All Pac 12 last year. I am assuming that he’s got the inside track to win the other starting edge spot.” — FSU91\nEDGE Marvin Jones Jr.\n“I’m not sure what to expect from him this season. Just haven’t seen much from him at the college level (good or bad).” — Noles885\nVoting Breakdown\n- QB DJ Uiagalelei — 6 votes\n- WR Hykeem Williams – 2 votes\n- LB Shawn Murphy – 2 votes\n- DT\nDarrell Jackson– 1 vote\n- EDGE\nSione Lolohea– 1 vote\n- EDGE\nMarvin Jones Jr.– 1 vote\n- WR\nMalik Benson– 1 vote\n- OL\nJulian Armella– 1 vote\n- LB DJ Lundy – 1 vote\n- OL\nTJ Ferguson– 1 vote\n- TE\nLanden Thomas– 1 vote\n- OT\nLucas Simmons– 1 vote\n- WR\nVandrevius Jacobs– 1 vote\n- RB\nJaylin Lucas– 1 vote\nJoin Warchant for Market-Leading Florida State Football coverage!\nWarchant.com provides just what passionate FSU fans expect: Market-leading coverage of Seminole athletics and recruiting.\nJoin the largest Florida State fan community and receive all the benefits that come with it:\n- Elite team and recruiting coverage of the program you love.\n- Exclusive video and board Q&A’s with Warchant staff.\n- Interaction with the most passionate Seminole fans across multiple board forums.\n- 10% off all\nGarnet & Goldpurchases while holding an active membership.

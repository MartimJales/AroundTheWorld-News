    "text": "SAN ANTONIO – If you bought groceries at Walmart in the past several years, you may be entitled to some cash. It’s part of a $45 million class-action lawsuit settlement. The [lawsuit claimed Walmart](https://www.walmartweightedgroceriessettlement.com/home) overcharged customers for certain weighted goods such as packaged meats and bagged citrus fruits. For example, evidence in the court records showed that a pork tenderloin was marked in the store at $3.92 per pound, but the packaging was $4.36 per pound. Another example was a bag of oranges. The store signage and product barcode sticker said $7.98 per pound. But, the bag contained only five pounds of oranges. Walmart has denied any wrongdoing, but settled the case. As a result, customers who shopped at Walmart stores between October 18, 2018 and January 19, 2024 and purchased any of a [ long list of weighted meats](https://www.walmartweightedgroceriessettlement.com/product-descriptions), poultry or seafood or bags of oranges, grapefruit or tangerines, are eligible to file a claim. The deadline to file a claim is June 5. You can [ file a claim here](https://angeion-public.s3.amazonaws.com/www.walmartweightedgroceriessettlement.com/docs/Claim%20Form.pdf). Customers who have proof of purchase may receive up to $500. Those without proof will receive much less, up to $25. The court will hold a hearing for final approval on June 12. If approved, the claims could be processed in several months.",

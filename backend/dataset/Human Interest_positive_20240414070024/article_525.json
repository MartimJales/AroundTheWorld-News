    "text": "Reviewed by: Patience Itson Why this Trussville sports mom loves working at this new orthopedic + injury clinic Sponsored Trussville is known for being an active community and big sports town with kids participating in all sorts of school sports from gymnastics and cheerleading to baseball and football. (Go Huskies!) While it’s typically all fun and games, what happens when you get an injury at 1PM on a Saturday? Your first thought may be to head to the ER, I suggest Trussville’s newest clinic, [OS1 Orthopedic & Sports Injury Clinic](https://bettersooner.com/), open 7 days a week. I chatted with one of the Physician’s Assistants to learn how she’s helping helping kids (and adults!) get back into action. Meet Eve Santiago, PA-C Eve Santiago is a certified Physician’s Assistant at OS1 in Trussville. Eve, originally from Alpharetta, Georgia, moved to Birmingham to attend UAB’s PA School. It was during her time in Birmingham that she met her husband, Nestor. They have since settled in Trussville, where they’ve raised their three children, all of whom are highly involved in sports. Eve’s love for Trussville is a big reason why she’s so excited about OS1’s new clinic at The Pinnacle Shopping Center. “As a resident of Trussville, I am excited to bring this concept to my hometown. It’s a privilege to serve my community and surrounding areas by providing efficient orthopedic care. With nearly two decades of experience in sports medicine and general orthopedics, I am confident that this new concept of specialized patient care will greatly benefit Trussville.”Eve Santiago, PA-C, OS1 Orthopedic & Sports Injury Clinic OS1 Orthopedic & Sports Injury Clinic is ready to help you feel better I recently met Eve and some of the OS1 staff to see the facility and learn more about their services. Not only was everyone incredibly nice, but I got to see them in action during an emergency. During the last few minutes of my visit, a young high school girl in a tennis uniform walked into the office with an ice pack in hand and an injured arm. I watched as Eve and OS1’s staff quickly jumped into action to help the patient by taking her information and prepping an exam room. While my eyewitness account ended there, it showed that OS1 is a place that is quick and efficient and truly cares about its patients. Services + more Whether it’s a sprained ankle from the basketball court or a chronic orthopedic issue (yes, they also help adults!), OS1’s got you covered. Medical services offered include: - Castings, slings + braces - Injections - Sports Physicals - X-Rays + MRIs - And more “OS1 Orthopedic & Sports Injury Clinic is here to help bridge the gap in orthopedic accessibility between injury and treatment by ensuring patients receive specialized care when they need it.

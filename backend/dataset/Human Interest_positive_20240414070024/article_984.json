    "text": "Brock’s upcoming annual Pride Week is an opportunity to celebrate and support the University’s vibrant and diverse community. With a wide range of activities scheduled from Monday, March 18 to Wednesday, April 3, it will take more than seven days to celebrate the Two Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or questioning, intersex, and asexual (2SLGBTQIA+) communities at Brock. While Brock also celebrates Pride Month in June, marking Pride Week in March allows the entire Brock community to learn and celebrate while many students are still on campus before the end of Winter Term. This year’s Pride Week events have been organized by Brock’s Student Justice Centre, the Office of Human Rights and Equity (HRE), the Sexual Violence Prevention Committee, the 2SLGBTQ+ Working Group, Brock Pride Club, Brock University Students’ Union (BUSU), and Student Life and Succes. “Pride Week is a powerful reminder of our commitment to creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all members of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community on campus,” says Alana Lowe, HRE’s Manager of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, Education and Outreach. “These celebrations not only honour the struggles and achievements of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community but also inspire us to continue our journey towards a more equitable and socially just society.” The Brock Library will kick off the celebrations with its Know Your Pride Flags exhibit, which showcases some of the more than 50 flags used by the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. A featured Read Out Proud collection of 2SLGBTQIA+ Books and Films can also be found on the Brock Library website and a curated print display of non-fiction and novels examining queer life and issues such as race, disability and politics can also be found at the Badger Books Collection in the Library Learning Commons. Pride Week offers several creative workshops, including a Queer Crafternoon featuring colouring sheets, button making and origami. Those who want to wear their Pride can bring their own t-shirt and learn how to apply vinyl transfers. Students can also register in advance for Canvas or Pottery painting sessions hosted by the Student Justice Centre and Student Life and Success. In collaboration with Brock Pride and Pride Niagara, BUSU will host its annual Drag Show and Pasta Bar on Thursday, March 21. Students seeking support for mental and physical health issues related to gender and sexual violence and healthy relationships, or who may just need someone to talk to, may access Peer 2 Peer support by visiting the drop-in schedule on HRE ExperienceBU. To learn more or to register for an event visit the ExperienceBU .",

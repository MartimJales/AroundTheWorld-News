    "text": "It was the highest-income year in the history of Burghausen tourism, reports managing director Sigrid Resch. 110,000 overnight stays, more than 30,000 guests on around 1,600 guided tours, more than half a million visitors to the castle and 231 boat trips on the Salzach: all record values ​​in 2023 that Burghauser tourism can look back on.\nThe tourist attraction is undoubtedly the world’s longest castle. But more and more people not only want to take a walk around the castle, but also learn about history. “The demand for our guest tours is enormous, the tours in historical clothing are particularly popular. But the numerous themed tours and, last year in particular, the culinary tours are also highlights for our guests,” says Resch.\nShortage of tour guides The demand is so high that the tour guides are now reaching their capacity limits. “We hope that more guides can be trained this year so that we can continue to meet demand in the future,” says the managing director.\nThe tourism experts are particularly pleased that Burghausen is not only popular for short and day trips, but that the average length of stay has increased to more than two days. The mobile home parking space is also popular; around 3,000 mobile homes stopped in Burghausen last year. The cross-border discovery district also posted record values, the OÖN reported. Among other things, because there are many cycle tourists in the region – and they also often head to Burghausen as a destination.\n2024 is already promising The new year is also off to a promising start, as Sigrid Resch explains. Up to 2,000 visitors come to the castle on the weekends, the booking situation is already good, although the official season only started with the start of the International Jazz Week (March 12th to 17th).\nePaper\nRead the ePaper now!\nRead the daily ePaper edition of the OÖNachrichten – browse through it digitally now!\nto the e-paper\ninfo By clicking on the icon you can add the keyword to your topics.\ninfo\nBy clicking on the icon you open your “my topics” page.

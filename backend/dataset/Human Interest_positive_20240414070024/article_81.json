    "text": "Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. (NYSE: GPMT) (“GPMT,” “Granite Point” or the “Company”) today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2024. This dividend is payable on April 15, 2024, to holders of record of common stock at the close of business on April 1, 2024.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4375 per share of the 7.00% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for the first quarter of 2024. This dividend is payable on April 15, 2024, to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock at the close of business on April 1, 2024.\n“When establishing the new quarterly dividend, our Board evaluated a number of factors, including the impact of nonaccrual loans on our near-to-medium-term profitability, our low level of leverage, the ongoing trends in the commercial real estate market, and market expectations for future interest rate cuts,” said Jack Taylor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Granite Point. “We believe that over time our distributable earnings before losses will cover the dividend; however, in the near-term our nonaccrual loans will impact our profitability and resolving them will require some time, given the dislocated market. Once we resolve these loans we expect our run-rate earnings to improve.”\nAbout Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc.\nGranite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. is a Maryland corporation focused on directly originating, investing in and managing senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. Granite Point is headquartered in New York, NY.

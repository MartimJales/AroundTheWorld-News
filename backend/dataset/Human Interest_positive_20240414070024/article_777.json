    "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. - Dozens of people on Thursday shaved their heads or got a substantial haircut all for a good cause.\n“Honestly very humbling. We put in so much work for this,” said Karli Hall with Geaux Bald.\nStudents and staff at LSU Health Shreveport School of Medicine showed up big time to support Geaux Bald’s Shave Day. Losing their hair to raise some money to help cancer patients.\n“It's given a lot of meaning personally to me as a second year medical student, where we don't really get to have a lot of patient interaction. We're really just like studying all day, every day,” said Mary Claire Walker with Geaux Bald.\nThe money raised will go towards the McDade House renovation in Shreveport. It's a place where patients or their family members can stay for free during treatment at the Feist-Weiller Cancer Center.\n“The McDade House was originally built and opened in 1985. It has 15 bedrooms. It's an awesome structure. It has great bones. But there are a couple of things that need to happen that won't be seen, of course, to bring it up to code, to make it a safe place for our patients to stay, like putting in a sprinkler system, ADA bathrooms, you know, all those big ticket items,” said Margo Holland with the Feist-Weiller Cancer Center.\nThey’re hoping to break ground on the project within the next year.\n“Almost 50% of our patients have to travel more than 20 miles to get their care because we care for everyone,” said Holland.\nGeaux Bald participants are happy to help in a fun way.\n“Getting to focus our fundraising efforts on that and then getting to this point where we celebrate this growth. I really can't describe it,” said Walker.\nShave Day has raised more than $27,700.\nReport a typo on this article",

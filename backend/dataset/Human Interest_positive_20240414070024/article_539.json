Gusty winds and small hail are possible. Low near 65F. Winds SE at 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 80%.\nUpdated: March 14, 2024 @ 5:13 pm\nA public meeting on the Hop’s new micro-transit system will be held from 4:45 to 6:45 p.m. on Friday.\nThe meeting, led by the Hill Country Transit District, will be at the Temple Public Library, 100 W. Adams Ave. in downtown Temple.\nThe service, which will replaced the agency’s fixed routes, will resemble a shared-ride service such as Uber or Lyft but will still only cost the current price of a ride on one of the fixed-route service buses: $1.\nFor people who rely on the bus for transportation, the new service is expected to reduce wait times and increase the satisfaction from the rider, officials said.\nThe transit district will gather public comments on the new system, expected to be implemented this May.\n“These zones are expected to revolutionize transportation accessibility for Temple residents,” a news release said. “However, it’s imperative that the community’s voice is heard and considered in this decision-making process.”\nThe changes will affect complementary paratransit service, available through the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n“It’s crucial that individuals who rely on these services have the opportunity to provide feedback and express any concerns they may have,” the release said. “It’s worth noting that Medicaid transportation services will not be affected by these changes.\nA copy of the proposed options for route changes will be made available at the public hearing.\nFor more information, contact the district at 254-933-3700.",

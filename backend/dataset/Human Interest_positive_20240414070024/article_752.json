The Canadian Volunteer Fire Department chief is highlighting the outpouring of support. “Got letters from schools from all over, you know, third grade classes sending letters and things and its just been a, you know, I hate to say we have to meet this way, but you know the outpouring has been great,” said Fire Chief Scott Brewster. One third grader, Marley Sanchez, wanted to show her love and support by drawing her community firefighters saving Aud, the famous Canadian dinosaur. “I drew a poster that says, ‘I love you Canadian.’ I draw a fireman setting the fires down and I’m supporting them,” said Sanchez, a student at Baker Elementary School. The fires burned 112 homes in Hemphill County, and Sanchez says she wants the firefighters to know she loves and appreciates them helping her family. “We start early and, you know, the kids are our future, they look up to you. You go around town and they go, ‘You’re that fireman aren’t you?’ and they go, ‘Yeah.’ And you know, it makes you feel good, and just even know the little ones are thinking as well in these times,” said Brewster. The Canadian third grade student had one more thing to say to the Canadian volunteer firefighters. “I appreciate for them and I support them,” said Sanchez. Copyright 2024 KFDA.

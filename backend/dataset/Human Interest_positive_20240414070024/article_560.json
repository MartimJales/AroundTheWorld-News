    "text": "Applications are being accepted for college scholarships awarded by America’s dairy farmers and importers through the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board.\nEleven scholarships worth $2,500 each will be awarded, and one outstanding recipient will receive a $3,500 James H. Loper Jr. Memorial Scholarship. NDB funds, in part, Dairy Management Inc., which manages the national dairy checkoff program.\nUndergraduate students in their sophomore through senior year for the 2024-25 academic school year and enrolled in college or university programs emphasizing dairy are eligible. Relevant majors may include communications/public relations, journalism, marketing, business, economics, nutrition, food science, and agriculture education.\nScholarships are awarded based on academic achievement, an interest in a career in a dairy-related discipline, and demonstrated leadership, initiative, and integrity. Candidates must complete an application form, submit an official transcript of all college courses, and write a short statement describing their career aspirations, dairy-related activities, and work experiences.\nThe application information is evaluated by an NDPRB Scholarship Committee composed of an external review panel and at least two Board members. The committee’s recommendations are summarized by NDPRB staff, and the scholarships are then awarded.\nStudents may be awarded scholarships in multiple years. Scholarship winners must be enrolled during the entire academic year for which the scholarship is awarded.\nApplications can be\nfound here. Completed applications must be received no later than May 31, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. CST.\nThe winners will be announced to both the awardee and the university department chairperson later this fall. Scholarship winners will receive a swag pack and a check for the award amount. The stipend will be forwarded to the department head/chairperson for issuance to awardees upon enrollment for the fall 2023-2024 term.\n»Related:\nNational DHIA selects winners for $14K in scholarships",

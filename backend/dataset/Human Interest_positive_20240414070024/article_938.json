According to SOS Mediterranee, of the 25 survivors, all were men and 12 were minors, two, even children. Those rescued were from Senegal, Gambia and Mali.

After yesterday’s rescue of 25 people in very weak health condition, a medical evacuation took place in cooperation with the Italian Coast Guards. Two unconscious people our teams weren’t able to rouse were flown to Sicily by helicopter.

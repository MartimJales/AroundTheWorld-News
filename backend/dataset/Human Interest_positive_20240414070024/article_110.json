    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- Trend News Agency) BAKU, Azerbaijan, March 14. It is necessary to focus on solving social problems, said Muhammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prize laureate (2006), at a panel session at the XI Global Baku Forum, Trend reports. \"Addressing social issues should be our primary focus, as it stands among our main challenges. Rather than rebuilding, our aim should be to innovate and create anew,\" the Nobel laureate said. The XI Global Baku Forum is attended by representatives of many countries and prestigious international organizations, with more than 350 guests from more than 70 countries. The forum, which will run by March 16, will participate in global discussions about the outcomes of COP28 and the preparation for COP29. It will discuss causes endangering the evolving world order, including security concerns and peace possibilities, as well as initiatives to promote stability in a tumultuous global landscape and the consequences.

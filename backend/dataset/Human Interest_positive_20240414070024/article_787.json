With the really cold weather and things, people get behind,” said Rickett .\nShe stated that it’s always good to remember the mission statement.\nTo meet human needs in Jesus’s name without discrimination. And so as we get to approaching Easter, we’re talking about Jesus, we’re talking about his role in our lives, we’re talking about his sacrificial love for us and doing so, you know, Jesus was for the needy,” said Rickett .\nRickett stated that she is happy the community has helped with their food drive.\n“We do spend about 1,000 dollars a month to order food to try to give away to our communities so any donations there are very helpful,” said Rickett.\nThe Salvation Army also distributes diapers to families with infants and toddlers.\nThey also have Teen Day, which gives teenagers the opportunity to play games or basketball outside.\nBut what stands out the most to her in what they’re doing?\n“They know people love them and care about them. So monetary donations, even what may seem small to one person may keep someone in their house,” said Rickett.\nThe Salvation Army annually helps millions of Americans overcome poverty, addiction and economic hardships.\nFor more local news, click here.\nCategories : Local News , News Share this...\nemail Print Facebook Twitter Linkedin",

    "text": "Nic Nemeth reflects on his friendships from WWE.\nThe reigning IWGP Global Champion recently sat down with\n SoCal Val for a fan Q&A. During the session, Nemeth was asked about who is best friends were during his time with WWE.\n“I tended to gravitate toward people who were trying to jump out of the box and make things happen,” Nemeth said. “So The Miz was always trying to do something different, out of the box, get noticed on a different show just to get some more eyes on a WWE match for him or something. John Morrison doing the craziest stuff and stunts and movies.\n“Zack Ryder, or Matt Cardona, was basically spearheading the YouTube start of WWE, which is insane. Because of him, WWE got a YouTube deal and now everyone’s online. That’s so crazy to me. But just people who always wanted more. We would come to work and we would work hard and like, ‘What else can do? What are we missing?’\n“We all just gravitated toward each other because we wanted more and we wanted to do it ourselves and just find a way of breaking through that glass ceiling of not gold circle people that you know, you’re not hand-picked — except for Miz. We all loved doing that extra stuff and we all gravitated toward each other I think.”\nLater, the former Dolph Ziggler was asked more about what it was like working with his long-time rival\nThe Miz.\n“Working with The Miz is easily the worst thing anyone could ever do at any point,” Nemeth joked, “but at least I don’t have to live with him. That’s on Maryse. No, Miz is awesome. He goes above and beyond, we’ve mentioned that.\n“He always went above and beyond to make something special or better, so we would always try and out-do each other because for a little while we were competing for a certain spot. Eventually he got it handed to him, which is fine. But he’s just someone who works so hard and he’s a friend of yours, so you can punch him just a little bit harder makes it that much sweeter I think.”\nRELATED:\nNic Nemeth Pitched Cashing In His Money In The Bank Contract For A Match With Shawn Michaels\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit For The Love of Wrestling with a h/t to WrestleZone for the transcription.",

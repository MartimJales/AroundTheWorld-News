    "text": "On its 10th Giving Blueday, the University of Michigan community rallied to give nearly $5.3 million to support students, research, medicine, the arts, athletics and more.\nGifts came from more than 11,500 donors across the U.S. and around the world, including alumni, students, faculty, staff, retirees and friends of the university, and were made to all three campuses and Michigan Medicine.\nmore information\nThe university’s annual day of giving, which took place on March 13, was extended until noon the following day due to technical difficulties that may have prevented some donors from making a gift through the giving website.\nLaunched in 2014, Giving Blueday has received almost 100,000 donations totaling over $52 million in the last 10 years.\n“The fact that we have been doing this for a decade now speaks volumes about the energy and passion of our community and its commitment to supporting all of the things that make Michigan the special place that it is. We’re grateful that people recognize the important work we are doing on our campuses and around the world,” said Tom Baird, vice president for development.\nNineteen different challenges were offered this year, such as the Cuteness Overload challenge and Raise the Bar challenge, providing supporters with opportunities to unlock additional funds for their causes. More than 140 student organizations raised funds on Giving Blueday as well, including the Engineering Global Leadership Honors Program, UM-Dearborn’s MASA, and UM-Flint’s Women’s Soccer.\nThe unit receiving the most gifts through the Giving Blueday website was LSA, while the student organization that received the most gifts was MRacing Formula SAE. Among student organizations and causes that won giving challenges throughout the day were Wolverine Pathways, Michigan Marching Band – Elbel Club, and Wolverine Support Network.\nOn Giving Blueday 2023, more than 11,200 donors gave more than $5.3 million to the university.",

Read more Letters to the Editor .\nWe should celebrate\nlandlines’ removal Re: “Editorial: Reject AT&T bid to shed its landlines ” (Page A8, March 10).\nThe editorial is off-base. As an electrical engineer, I’ve long called for the removal of obsolete landlines.\nOverhead lines require maintenance, but no company takes responsibility. When PG&E reluctantly clears branches from high-voltage wires, any discussion of disentangling limbs from phone wires is met by: “You’ll have to contact the company responsible for those wires. Who’s that? I have no idea!” Yet it may well be phone wires that cause poles to topple in a storm.\nWill unmaintained wires and switch boxes save you in an emergency? I’ll take my chances with redundant microwave towers. Cellular is available from my car, even in remote areas. When was the last time you found a pay phone?\nAnd thick wire bundles are an absolute blight! Our brains often “tune out” their ugliness, but neighborhoods with underground wiring are pleasantly remarkable.\nI applaud the removal of overhead wires.\nThomas Battle\nLos Altos Hills\nPostpartum contraception\ndeserves our support As obstetricians at Stanford University, we support the introduction of AB 2129 by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, D-Irvine, to improve access to postpartum contraception.\nAccess to contraception decreases unintended pregnancy. Notably, 70% of pregnancies occurring in the first year after delivery are unintended. These short-interval pregnancies are a risk factor for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Many patients do not attend follow-up visits, thus it is critical we introduce contraceptive care plans before they are discharged home.\nAccess to contraception postpartum is limited by a lack of consistent method for payment. I, along with my colleagues Doctors Natalie Spach, Samantha Kruger, Isabel Beshar, Lauren Tostrud, Ravali Reddy, Pamela K. Meza, Tim Gemesi and Samantha Wagner, am concerned about how differential access to postpartum contraception leads to possible reproductive coercion. Similar to Medi-Cal, AB 2129 would allow for reimbursement for contraception initiated during birth hospitalization for those with private insurance.\nDr. Sarah Owens\nPalo Alto\nSchools stepping up on\nstudent mental health Re: “ Schools making students’ mental health a priority ” (Page A1, March 9).\nI’m a graduate student at San Jose State University’s School of Social Work. The growth of wellness centers in local schools is heartening. Building mental health and coping tools into schools’ infrastructure gives our community’s children power over their struggles, better equipping them to handle stressors as they come.\nSchool can be mentally exhausting, particularly for those who face bullying or who don’t always feel supported at home. Despite progress, seeking therapeutic help can be costly, stigmatizing and inaccessible.\nEducation is important, but it’s not fair to expect students to absorb lessons when they are depleted, plagued by overstimulation or operating within a heightened stress response. When a student is physically ill or injured, they are given time away from the classroom to get better. When a student needs time to recenter or heal their mind, they should be given the same grace. These centers are a leap in the right direction.\nMaya Profio\nSan Jose\nTrump supporters\nreflect his faults Re: “ Continued support for Trump is confounding ” (Page A6, March 7).\nHere is an answer to Pauline Chand’s letter to the editor asking “why you would choose a man who has demonstrated racism and misogyny.” Before I answer, let us not forget that he has many more ugly attributes such as being vulgar, impolite, xenophobic, a sexual assaulter and a fraudster (both as established in court), a bully, a bigot, a liar, a propagandist and a demagogue.\nPeople vote for him because they themselves have some of these ugly attributes inside their own characters and personalities, and it doesn’t bother them in the least. They have some of these attributes in large amounts or in minute amounts, consciously or subconsciously, in the open or secretly inside. This is a very hard truth and acknowledging this hard truth was not easy for me to come around to, but it explains everything.\nGuy Vigier\nNovato\nTo invest in America,\nstop voting Republican Re: “ America has blown almost $2 trillion — make it stop ” (Page A6, March 8).\nI read with interest Kathryn Anne Edwards’ commentary. This seems to have been written entirely out of context. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is more commonly known as the Trump tax cuts. The way to stop America from funding rich corporations and wealthy individuals and to start really investing in what is good for America is to stop voting Republican.\nDavid Coale\nPalo Alto\nCease-fire needed to\nprotect Gaza’s children Related Articles Letters to the Editor | Letters: Reconsider rate hike Letters to the Editor | Letters: Costly delays | Remedy service | Nonprofit utility Letters to the Editor | Letters: Deny AT&T | Check sources | Agree on health care | Crossing line Letters to the Editor | Letters: Let A’s go | Hope to Democrats | Biden, Trump Letters to the Editor | Letters: Shameful turnout | Pot problems | Know Trump | Reject Kennedy | Gaza policy I recently sat down with the Palestinian family of a friend of mine for dinner. As an American who has no stake in the conflict overseas, I always felt uncomfortable speaking up on the war in Gaza.\nThis family I ate dinner with spoke about their relatives in Palestine, and how they did not know if they would survive another day. After seeing my friend’s family discuss what is happening in the Gaza Strip and how they are impacted, as well as coming to the realization that my tax dollars are paying to provide Israel with the bombs being used to kill children, I know that something needs to change and a cease-fire declared.\nSomething needs to be done to protect Palestinian children in Gaza.\nSamantha Ainlay\nSan Jose\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Report an error Policies and Standards Contact Us Most Popular Most Popular Dear Abby: Can I trust my husband after what he said to my friend?

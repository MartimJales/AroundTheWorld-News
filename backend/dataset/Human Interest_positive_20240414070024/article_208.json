    "text": "We all know how the Ambanis live a life of unfathomable luxury. In fact after the kind of three-day extravaganza they threw for their youngest son Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's pre-wedding ceremonies, the entire world knows of Ambanis' elite lifestyle.\nBusiness tycoon Mukesh Ambani, who is also the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries has a net worth of more than $117.8 billion according to Forbes, as of March 2024, making him the world&apos;s ninth richest man.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Ambani Family (@ambani_update)\n\\n He lives in a lavish Mumbai house that is reportedly worth over Rs 15,000 crores. His house, famously known as &apos;Antilia,&apos; is a 27-storey building located in South Mumbai&apos;s Altamount Road.\nIt turns out that out of the 27 floors, Nita Ambani chooses to live on a particular floor and has a secret reason behind it, as per reports on DNA.\nÂ© Instagram/Ambani FC\nNita Ambani and husband Mukesh Ambani live on the 26th floor as they require every room to have adequate natural light and proper ventilation and perhaps that is why only a select few close people are allowed on the 26th floor.\nThe other floors in the building include a health spa, salon, three swimming pools, and a ballroom among many other facilities. There is also a dance studio, a yoga center and a staff of 600 people to manage operations around the house.\nAnant Ambani, Akash Ambani, his wife Shloka and their children Prithvi Akash Ambani and Veda Akash Ambani, also reside on the 26th floor.\nSource: DNA",

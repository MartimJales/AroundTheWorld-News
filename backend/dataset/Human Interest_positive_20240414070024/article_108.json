    "text": "On World Kidney Day, the spotlight shines on the altruistic act of kidney donation, revealing a significant gender disparity in living kidney donors. Studies globally indicate that over 70% of living kidney donors are women, highlighting a trend where men are less likely to step forward for this life-saving procedure. Despite being traditionally viewed as pillars of strength, men are underrepresented in the realm of live kidney donation. Various factors contribute to this gender gap, including economic pressures, health concerns, and societal norms. Dr Deepak Jayaprakash Kaddu , Consultant for Urology, Robotic Surgery, and Renal Transplantation at Manipal Hospital Whitefield, Bengaluru, sheds light on the reasons behind this disparity and aims to raise awareness and dispel fears surrounding kidney donation among men. Key Concerns Identified: Dr Kaddu emphasizes the importance of raising awareness and addressing these fears to encourage more men to consider living kidney donation. By fostering dialogue and education, we aim to bridge the gender gap in kidney donation and save lives.

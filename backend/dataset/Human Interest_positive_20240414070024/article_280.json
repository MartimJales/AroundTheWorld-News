    "text": "Westchester County, New York – As an In Our Own Voice Sponsor of NAMI Westchester’s 40th Anniversary Find Help Find Hope Gala, Littman Krooks is proud to demonstrate its commitment to supporting mental health and advocating for the rights of those with mental illness. We also extend our gratitude and congratulations to NAMI for their incredible milestone and continued work in the Westchester community.\n“The work of NAMI Westchester is more critical than ever,” says Marion M. Walsh, a partner of Littman Krooks LLP who currently serves as President of the Board of Directors of NAMI Westchester. “We applaud the work of NAMI Westchester, she adds, as our work at Littman Krooks is aligned to their mission in helping individuals and families whose lives are affected by mental illness,” she adds.\nHere are some of the reasons we sponsor NAMI:\nNAMI Westchester works to end the pervasive stigma that society perpetuates toward individuals with mental health disorders, through programs such as In Our Own Voice. This program spreads the message of hope and recovery through presentations by leaders with lived experience to show that individuals with mental health challenges can lead fulfilling lives. At Littman Krooks, we work to help families ensure that their loved ones have the right legal protections, services and public benefits, educational and community services. Through their outreach programs, NAMI Westchester educates the community on mental health and suicide prevention. For example, the Ending the Silence program for young people is critical to educate on mental health and suicide prevention, for young people. We applaud NAMI Westchester’s commitment to build a community of hope through their HelpLine , support groups and educational classes, which help families create support systems. At Littman Krooks, we work to help families navigate services and to obtain appropriate public benefits, and we advocate for changes in legislation. The people who volunteer with NAMI Westchester are hopeful, bright and sensitive and we love being a partner and supporting this work. So many of these volunteers share their dedication each day and it is an honor to be part of this work. “We are proud to support NAMI and their mission to eradicate the stigma associated with mental illness,” said Bernard A. Krooks, founding partner of Littman Krooks . “We believe that everyone deserves access to quality mental health care, and we are committed to doing our part to make that a reality.”\nFor more information about NAMI Westchester and its programs, please visit https://namiwestchester.org .\nLittman Krooks provides sophisticated legal advice and the high-level of expertise ordinarily associated with large law firms along with the personal attention and responsiveness of smaller firms.

    "text": "By Staff Reports ,\n8 hours ago Our Volunteer of the Week this week is Mike Jones. He is a retired teacher, coach and athletic director from Vicksburg Catholic School. He holds a bachelor’s of arts degree from Mississippi State University. He is a member of St. Michael’s Catholic Church. He is married to Karen Jones and has two children, Katelyn and Lee, and two grandchildren, John Michael and Harrison.\nHow did your volunteering for the Miss Mississippi pageant begin?\nAs a member and past president of the Vicksburg Jaycees, I was elected to be on the board of the Miss Mississippi Pageant in the early ’80s.\nHow long have you been volunteering with Miss Mississippi?\nI have been volunteering for the Miss Mississippi Pageant for 41 years. I started in 1983.\nWhat is your favorite memory while volunteering for Miss Mississippi?\nOur trips to Atlantic City every year were some of my fondest memories. The people I interacted with from around the country became lifelong friends. Being a part of an organization such as the Miss America system that has provided scholarship monies for young women all across our nation is a satisfying feeling.\nWhat would you tell someone who is thinking about volunteering?\nThere is a major need for volunteering in our community. I would encourage everyone to take part in a volunteer organization of their choosing.\nWhat are some of the tasks while volunteering for Miss Mississippi?\nI started my journey as a volunteer in the concession stands at the pageant. I was then an auditorium coordinator for a couple of years and then elected to the Jaycee Board of the Pageant, as the Jaycees were supplying manpower at the time. I also served as executive secretary, business manager for Miss Mississippi, board member, and executive director for the pageant. I currently serve as the judges chairman with my wife Karen.\nWhat have you learned from volunteering?\nI have learned that when you are a part of an organization as a volunteer, you have to pour your heart into it to succeed.\nHow can someone else who might be interested in volunteering with Miss Mississippi get involved?\nTalk to people you know who are involved in this organization. You can also reach out to our office (601-636-6746).\nIf there is a volunteer who should be featured, please submit their name and contact information to volunteer@vicksburgpost.com.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

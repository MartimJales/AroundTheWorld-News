    "text": "The Lancaster Public Library has a thriving story hour program. From infant story time, toddler story time, pajama story time to mindfulness, song and read and even, sign and read story time, the library draws scores of children every week to its diverse story hour program. Never has it had the groundswell of interest from the public to a program like the one scheduled for March 23: More than 300 families have signed up to attend a Drag Queen Story Hour at the library. The schedule event is fueling opposition from conservative lawmakers but the head librarian said she is happy to host the event and welcome community members to participate in it. “It is very important that we provide information as a library to everyone that we serve in the community,” said Lissa Holland, executive director of the Lancaster Public Library. “This obviously is not just for families who may have a gay child in the family. It’s to show diversity and acceptance. That it’s ok to be who you are. You should love yourself and other people.” Some county and state lawmakers have opposed the event, including members of the Lancaster County House delegation, who on Wednesday called the program a misuse of taxpayer dollars intended to” sexualize” children. “This is a totally political and immoral use of our money,” read the statement jointly issued by state Republican Representatives David Zimmerman, Keith Greiner and Tom Jones. “We need to protect our children!” Holland said the program has nothing to do with the sexual objectification of children. “It is to read some fun books that are very age appropriate. And sing songs, the Hokey Pokey, the Rainbow Connection song from The Muppet Movie, and Teach the World to Sing,” Holland said. “It is very geared to young children to teach kindness and love. That’s all it is. It is not any kind of statement about homesexuality.” Holland rebuff some of the charges being leveled that such programs are intended to groom and indoctrinate children. “I don’t even know what that means,” she said. “This is a program where paretns are with their children. It’s one hour out of many programs that we hold. It’s nothing about being gay. It’s about being who you are.” Both Holland and Lancaster Pride, the organizer, said there are no plans to cancel or postpone the event. “If anything this is pushing us more to doing this,” said Tiffany Shirley, president of Lancaster Pride. “We are not backing down to people who want this shut down. We are showing them we are here and we want to have this event safely and we want to have a great time.” Holland said no one is being forced to attend the event. “If you are not comfortable with that, the bottom line is don’t come,” she said. Holland said the library has received a significant amount of feedback from the community — from both sides, in support of and against it. “We have had some beautiful notes and we’ve had some really hateful emails,” she said. “We have heard both slides loud an clear.” Drag Queen Story Hour at the Lancaster Public Library is free and will take place from 1 to 2 p.m. on March 23.

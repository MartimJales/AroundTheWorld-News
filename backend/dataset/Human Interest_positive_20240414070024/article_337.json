    "text": "(UPI) An Illinois woman scored a $1.4 million lottery jackpot with a ticket she bought using her children's birthday numbers.\nThe player, identified by the nickname \"Lucky Mom,\" told Illinois Lottery officials she used her kids' birthdays to buy a Lucky Day Lotto ticket online and checked the results during a late-night parenting session.\n\"My baby woke up crying, and after tucking them back into bed, I had trouble falling back asleep. So to pass the time, I opened the lottery app on my phone, and I couldn't believe it when it showed that I had just won $1.4 million! Absolutely wackadoodle,\" the winner said.\nShe knew the numbers were lucky even before winning the jackpot.\n\"I've played Lucky Day Lotto here and there, and when I do, I use my kids' birthdays as my lucky numbers,\" she said. I have the best job in the world: I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I already feel very lucky and blessed for where I'm at in life -- but today, the word 'lucky' took on a whole new meaning.\n The winner said it was one birthday in particular that turned out to be the luckiest numbers of all.\n\"After I won, I asked my husband -- 'Do you want to know which kid's birthday helped us win the jackpot?'\" she said.\nLucky Mom did not reveal if she has any immediate plans for her winnings.\n ",

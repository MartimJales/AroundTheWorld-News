    "text": "Pride of North Side wins … again [Fred Jeter](/staff/fred-jeter/) | 3/14/2024, 6 p.m. John Marshall High School did not compete in 2021 due to the pandemic. Many say that would have been the Justices’ strongest team. JM won the State Class 1 (highest enrollment) in 1920, ’36, ’37, 48 and ’54 prior to integration and when JM was located downtown on Marshall Street. Turn up the music, kick up your heels and let the good times roll. This is a story of talented young men, past, present and likely the future. At John Marshall, the basketball beat goes on and on. “No, it never gets old,” Coach Ty White said of his three-peat as state champ. Coach White first addressed Damon “Redd” Thompson in his postgame presser. The senior has been the shining star of the program during the glory run. In three seasons, Thompson has been a key cog in three state championships and an overall record of 75-7, including 25-3 this season. “The only thing that stopped him from four (state titles) was COVID,” Coach White said of the canceled 2020-21 season. “It’s been an unreal run.” With no pandemic, there was nothing in the Justices’ way. With minimal resistance, they routed Virginia High of Bristol, 89-32, in the Class 2 final at the Siegel Center. It could have been worse. A running clock (after JM went up by 30) shortened the game in the second half, denying the North Siders a shot at a rare triple-digit showing in the finals. “We play hard, with a lot of confidence and we specialize in our defense,” said Thompson, a 6-foot-1 guard who’s headed to James Madison University. Thompson also is a strong candidate for State Player of Year. JM was never threatened in the postseason. The average victory margin for six playoff games was 60 points. You read that right — 60! JM’s belly-to-belly defense, never allowing the opposition to take a deep breath, forced 24 turnovers with 16 steals, many leading to theatrical dunks and transition layups. “We’ve played good teams, but the difference is JM’s length … we haven’t played anyone with that kind of length,” said Virginia High Coach Julius Gallishaw. “We thought we had good shots, but then there was someone blocking them or creating a miss.” At times, JM had 6-foot-8 sophomore Latrell Allmond, 6-foot-9 junior Marcus Jackson and 6-foot-6 junior Desmon Rose clogging the lane. Known as the “Blue Forest,” all should be back next year. Thompson, always on the go with blistering speed, concluded his brilliant career with 12 points, four rebounds and six assists. Fellow guard, Chowan-bound Dominique Bailey, finished with 14 points and five rebounds. The Justices have made a clean sweep of All-State honors in Class 2. Damond “Redd” Thompson was named Player of Year and joined in the All-State squad by teammates Latrell Allmond, Dominique Bailey and Aiden Argabright. Ashram Moore made the second team. John Marshall’s Ty White was named Coach of Year.",

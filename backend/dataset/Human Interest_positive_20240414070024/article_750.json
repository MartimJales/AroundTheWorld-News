    "text": "All eyes have been on Prince William for the wrong reasons this week as [conspiracy theories](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a60165633/kate-middleton-edited-photo-conspiracy-theories-explained/) about his family have gone wild online following [Kate’s photoshopping disaster](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a60179448/kate-middleton-photoshop-kensington-palace-pr-disaster-analysis/). However, the Prince of Wales has remained focussed on his work and stepped out this evening for a cause most close to his heart. Prince William paid tribute to his mother Princess Diana tonight during an awards ceremony in her memory. He was the guest of honor at the Diana Legacy Awards, which were held at London’s Science Museum, where he presented awards to this year’s winners. “This evening’s Legacy Award is particularly special as it marks the 25th Anniversary year of The Diana Award – a charity set up to reflect my mother’s belief that young people can change the world,” the Prince said in a speech. “I know that she would have been honoured to see a charity in her name doing such inspirational work to uplift young people from all corners of the globe. She taught me that everyone has the potential to give something back, that everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life. That legacy is something that both Catherine and I have sought to focus on through our work, as have the 50,000 young people who have received a Diana Award over the past 25 years.” The legacy awards take place every two years and celebrate the achievements of 20 young leaders from across the world. This year’s winners come from countries including the USA, U.K, Romania, India, Jamaica and Pakistan. Prince Harry is also scheduled to appear at the event via video link later this evening. Prince William is expected to have departed by the time of his estranged brother’s appearance. In July 2021, William and Harry put on a united front and stood side by side to unveil a statue of Princess Diana outside Kensington Palace. However, since then relations have deteriorated further following the publication of [Harry’s astonishing memoir ](https://www.amazon.com/Spare-Prince-Harry-Duke-Sussex/dp/0593593804) [Spare](https://www.amazon.com/Spare-Prince-Harry-Duke-Sussex/dp/0593593804), in which he lifted the lid on royal life behind closed doors. When Harry recently traveled to the UK for a brief visit to see his father after his cancer diagnosis, William let it be known that he had no plans to see him.

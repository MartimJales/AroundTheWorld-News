    "text": "Autism advocate Cara Darmody has become one of the youngest entrepreneurs in Ireland after recently launching two separate courses for children aged 5-18, with the aim of sharing ‘the blueprint to success in life.’\nThe 13-year-old Ardfinnan native became the youngest person to sit a Leaving Cert exam last year after she sat the Ordinary Level Maths paper to raise funds and awareness for the long waiting lists prevalent in Ireland for those with disabilities.\nToday's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW Cara’s younger brothers Neil, 11, and John, 6, both have autism and severe/profound intellectual disabilities.\nAutism advocator Cara Darmody has become one of the youngest entrepreneurs in the country after recently launching two separate courses for kids and teenagers with the aim to sharing ‘the blueprint to success.’ Pic: Mark Darmody Over the last two years, Cara has advocated for better service for families living with autism meeting a host of politicians including An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar . She has also spoken at a host of events such as The Shine Festival in October.\nNow, the Tipperary teen has decided to share her wisdom with two newly launched online courses.\nHaving earned 97% in the Ordinary Level Leaving Cert Maths exam last year, Cara is offering individual Maths grinds via Zoom for students from 1st class in National School to Ordinary Level Leaving Cert students.\nThe hour-long session is €25 per hour, with the students getting a lesson on the exact area they want to concentrate on.\nSeparately, Cara has also put together an Inspiration course for children/teenagers aged between 5 and 18 years old who are on their phones too much; lack confidence; looking to improve academically and want to be inspired to achieve a more successful future.\nSpeaking to Extra.ie , Cara promised that the course would give those involved the ‘blueprint to success in life,’ as she shares all she has learned in her own successful journey in autism advocacy.\nCara’s younger brothers Neil, 11, and John, 6, both have autism and severe/profound intellectual disabilities. Pic: Mark Darmody ‘I love helping people and everyone wanted to know how I was so successful so I decided to share all my tactics and all my ways for everybody to see. I just want to help people, it’s that simple,’ Cara said.\nFrom a young age, Cara has been using the same method to achieve even the simplest of her goals — she thinks out her strategy and outlines the tactics to fulfil the strategy.\nIn Cara’s advocacy journey, her goal was to ‘campaign for change in the autism world.’ The strategy was to attend Leinster House 30 times in 2023, which would be achievable by contacting political parties and organising individual meetings.\nCara Darmody currently has a weekly column with The Nationalist and The Tipperary Star called The No Spin Zone where she interviews councillors running for local election. Pic: Provided Cara’s dad Mark explained: ‘I suppose she’s been using all these little tricks and secrets, how to deal with fear and all this mad stuff [and] she’s written it all down and now she’s ready to share it with people.’\nSpeaking to Extra.ie , Cara spoke of Mr Doubt — the negative voice that she believes everyone has in their head.\n‘If you are running in a race, do you ever heard a voice inside your head telling you you can’t do this; you’re gonna fail; you’re gonna mess up,’ she explained, ‘Everyone has this person talking to them. There is a person — or shall I say a little monster — on your shoulder called Mr Doubt.\n‘All he does is just spit and talk negative bad stuff into your brain and into your ears.’\nCara said there was no point in trying to fight Mr Doubt and said the only way to draw with him is to counteract the negative with a positive.\nMr Doubt and fear are both natural feelings, but Cara is adamant people shouldn’t let these voices win — talk back and counteract with a positive, she says.\nCara’s Inspiration Course aims to equip kids and teens with the right resources for handling fear, failure and doubt — all things that are normal to endure, but many don’t know how to deal with.\n‘I now want to be Taoiseach’ – 12-year-old who sat Leaving Cert Maths exam bags 97% ‘This course is going to teach you how to deal with fear, anxiety, failure; how to set up a goal and strategy and tactics. It’s going to give you the blueprint to success in life, and that’s why it’s the greatest course of all time,’ she said.\nFor more information on Cara’s Inspiration Course go here , or for Maths grinds go here .",

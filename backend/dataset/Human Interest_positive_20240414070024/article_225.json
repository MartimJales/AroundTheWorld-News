(WMTV) - The City of Beloit is recognizing veterans, Rosie-the-Riveters and volunteers with an honorary street renaming. The honorary name “VetsRoll Drive” was approved by the Beloit City Council on March 4. Riverside Drive from White Avenue to Henry Avenue will soon feature signage to commemorate the name. VetsRoll, Inc is an organization that transports veterans to Washington, D.C. with a caravan of wheelchair lift-equipped charter coaches with volunteer assistants, media, support vehicles, police and motorcycle escorts. The City of Beloit will also host a ceremonial unveiling event on April 7 at 1 p.m. at the Harry Moore Pavilion in Riverside Park, 1160 S. Riverside Drive. In case of bad weather, the event will be held in the Rotary River Center building in Riverside Park, according to the City of Beloit.

    "text": "Seconds after receiving a brutal blow last Sunday, Tulane baseball coach Jay Uhlman was waiting for UL’s wild celebration to end and counterpart Matt Deggs to come over when catcher Colin Tuft grabbed him first.\nTuft had let what would have been a game-ending strikeout pitch go through his legs with no one on in the bottom of the ninth inning. One single and a walk-off home run later, the Green Wave had let a 3-1 lead turn into a 4-3, series-deciding loss in the most painful way possible.\n“He (Tuft) said, ‘totally my fault, won’t happen again,’” Uhlman said. “It was full accountability. It shows you his character that in the moment of getting gut punched that he had the wherewithal to stand tall and just say that’s my fault.”\nThat type of interaction is why Uhlman is not discouraged by Tulane’s three consecutive one-run defeats following a 10-4 start. A year after going 19-42 in his debut, he looked for character and toughness when he remade the team and likes where the Wave is headed entering a home series with struggling Pepperdine (4-13).\nAnticipated bad weather has pushed up the start of Friday’s opener to 11 a.m. from 6:30 p.m.. Further re-scheduling is possible for the rest of the weekend due to a dicey forecast for Sunday in particular.\nNo matter what happens, look for Tuft to continue catching every inning behind the plate. A starter for 16 of 17 games, he refused to get rattled by his rare mistake on a nasty slider from Tulane reliever Jacob Moore.\nThe Cajuns’ Luke Yuhasz missed the pitch badly. So did Tuft.\n“It hit in the dirt right underneath my glove,” he said. “It’s one of those freak accidents. I make that play 99 out of 100 times. You take that, learn from it and grow as a player. That’s about it.”\nRelegated to left field in two years at Virginia because of first-round draft pick catcher Kyle Teel, Tuft relished the opportunity to get behind the plate again after transferring to Tulane. He had been charged with only one passed ball this year until Sunday’s fateful moment, which came after the announcers on Sunday’s ESPN+ broadcast repeatedly praised his ability to block pitches in the dirt.\n“I definitely see that as one of my strengths,” he said. “I take pride in trying to make the job for the pitchers a lot easier. My true calling is catching. I love catching.”\nUhlman is glad to have him, comparing his body type to personal friend and former 15-year Major Leagues catcher Jason Kendall.\n“He’s a hard worker,” Uhlman said. “He’s super smart, and he’s really good with our pitchers. He’s getting a lot of strike calls that are borderline strikes (because of his framing). That’s a huge advantage. He has good leadership skills. He’s better than I had hoped.”\nUhlman liked Tuft enough to move him to the leadoff spot in the order for the past four games. His 11 walks and five hit-by-pitches make up for his .179 batting average, which Uhlman believes is the product of bad luck on some hard-hit balls and will rise soon.\nTuft’s homer in the top of the ninth on Tuesday brought Tulane within one run of Southeastern Louisiana after it trailed 5-0 in the first. The Wave did not get the tying run, but it was another example of the team’s fight after it rallied to win games from five- and six-run deficits earlier in the year.\n“We’re never out of the fight,” Tuft said. “We have an extremely resilient team. I thought we were going to find a way to come back again.”\nTuft, from northern Virginia, never had been to Louisiana when he chose Tulane. He said he has enjoyed experiencing southern culture for the first time—the Washington D.C. area is nothing like the south in his mind—and loves Cajun and creole food.\nHe also believes Tulane will start cooking this year despite the back-to-back-to-back heartbreakers.\n“I feel like we’re in a really good spot to just explode,” he said. “We are going to take these lessons we learned in the last three games and be a much better team because of it.”",

Choices include fiction and nonfiction in paperback and hardcover, all genres, recent bestsellers and rare and specialty books. Also for sale will be DVDs, audio books, music books, music CDs, vintage magazines, novelties, and a large selection of children's books, DVDs, and CDs.\nMembers of the Friends of Eugene Public Library will be offered an early admission opportunity. Please bring your own bag or box to carry your treasures away.\nThe Book Sale is the Friends of Eugene Public Library's major fundraiser each year. More than 400 volunteers work on the sale, many year-round. To volunteer or to join the Friends, visit their website to find more information .\nNote to shoppers: If you come to the Book Sale after noon Saturday or anytime Sunday, you can walk right in. Or if you want to be among the first to enter, here are two ways to do that:\nDo you have gently used books and other items to donate? It's easy! Drop them off in the Downtown Library parking garage; at the Rite-Aid next to Sheldon Branch; or at Petersen Barn Community Center near Bethel Branch.

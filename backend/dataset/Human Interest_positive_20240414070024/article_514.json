    "text": "Benjamin Good’s lead dog Timber at the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race ceremonial start in Anchorage on (Tim Rockey / Alaska Public Media) Timber is a four-year-old on rookie musher Benjamin Good’s team, and Timber’s mother was Good’s first sled dog, Piper.\nGood said he and Piper had a great bond.\n“She would just always want to be around you, but also like, super high energy, always bouncing around, spinning around, barking and screaming,” Good said. “But like when we go camping, you know, she’s always right here, right at my hip.”\nGood said Timber carries a lot of the traits passed on from his mother.\n“Timber has a lot of those traits, too. He’s a little obnoxious around the yard with his high energy,” Good said. “But he always wants to be near me and always wants to be around me, so he does like to — when he gets excited — he’ll jump up and grab my beard with his front teeth.”\nGood said Timber is part of a litter named after the dogs of superheroes. Timber is running his first Iditarod, and will lead Good’s team to Nome.\nTimber is part of our “Dog of the Day” Iditarod series. Previously we met Paul , Ralph , Mussel , Junior , Meg , Schooby , Mayhem , Skookum , Rolex , Titan and Delmer .\nKeep our Iditarod coverage thriving!

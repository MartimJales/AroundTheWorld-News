    "text": "It was a golden day for Hatboro-Horsham’s Annie Jia Wednesday at the PIAA Class 3A Swimming Championships, the junior winning both the 200 individual medley and 100 butterfly — setting a PIAA record in the later — and helping the Hatters win in the 200 free relay. North Penn’s Maddie Faikish also claimed gold in the 200 free at Bucknell University’s Kinney Natatorium while the Upper Dublin took first place in the girls 200 medley relay. Jia broke her own PIAA record in winning the 100 fly, her time of 51.26 besting the 52.04 she swam as a freshman in 2022.

North Penn also picked up a pair of medals in diving as Joshua Gratton earned fourth place with 406.20 points and David Dian just behind in fifth at 401.10. Hofmann, a junior, swam a 1:49:87 in the 200 IM, an effort only bettered by Conestoga’s Jake Wang, who won with a NFHS Honor Roll time of 1:44.20. Sophomore Chung gave the Bucks bronze as he hit the wall in 1:52.98. Coyle earned second in the 100 fly with his NFHS Honor Roll finish of 47.57.

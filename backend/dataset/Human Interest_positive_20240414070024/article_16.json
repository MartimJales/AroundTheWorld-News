    "text": "Food Banks Mississauga has launched its annual Give 30 fundraiser following a record-breaking February that saw the highest number of people using the food bank in the organization's history.\nThere were 18,557 food bank clients last month, a 34-per-cent increase over last year.\nAccording to Food Banks Mississauga, Give 30 is a grassroots initiative founded in 2012 that encourages everyone to \"show empathy for those who face food insecurity and give in the spirit of Ramadan.\"\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Habib Canadian Bank is sponsoring the campaign and is matching donations.\n“This Ramadan, our community continues to face food insecurity at astounding rates because our elected officials are ignoring the needs of those living in poverty,\" Meghan Nicholls, Food Banks Mississauga CEO, said in a Monday news release. \"We are projecting that Food Banks Mississauga and our network of 65+ agency members will see 58,000 neighbours in need by the end of May, which is a 63% increase compared to last year.”\nThe organization said monetary donations enable it to source and purchase fresh and frozen food such as dairy, meat, grains, fruit and vegetables in bulk at lower prices than retail.\n\"We invite you to join us in the Give 30 campaign, where your generosity will create a substantial impact by providing essential resources to those in need,\" Muslim Hassan, Habib Canadian Bank president and CEO, said in the release. \"Let us all join in the spirit of this holy month of Ramadan, regardless of our faith or background, and come together to give back to our community!\"\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The campaign runs until April 9.

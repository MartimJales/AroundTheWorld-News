    "text": "Farmingdale-based John’s Crazy Socks is introducing its “official” socks in time for this year’s World Down Syndrome Day, on March 21. The company worked with Down Syndrome International and the National Down Syndrome Society to develop the socks. The theme of World Down Syndrome Day 2024 is “End the Stereotypes.” The company will donate 10% of the sale of the socks to Down Syndrome International and the National Down Syndrome Society. “I am so happy that we are making these socks for people around the United Sates and the world to celebrate people with Down Syndrome,” John Cronin, an entrepreneur with Down Syndrome who co-founded John’s Crazy Socks, said in a written statement. “With a meaningful design, these socks send a wonderful message.” To produce the socks, John’s Crazy Socks, Down Syndrome International and The National Down Syndrome Society invited members of the Down Syndrome community to submit designs. The company received designs from around the world and ultimately selected a design submitted by Emma Wanek of Egg Harbor, New Jersey. Wanek, 19, who has Down Syndrome, had graduated with her class in 2023 and is currently a “super senior,” enjoying another year in high school, according to John’s Crazy Socks. Wanek’s design, complete with blue and yellow colors that signify Down Syndrome awareness express that individuals with Down Syndrome are “rock stars,” and feature the 3-21 date on the top band. The socks “will make people happy and we are so excited to collaborate with a company founded and led by an entrepreneur with Down Syndrome,” Andrew Boys, executive director of Down Syndrome International, said in a written statement. “We hope people will wear these socks to celebrate World Down Syndrome Day.” Kandi Pickard, president and CEO of the National Down Syndrome Society, said in a written statement that “John and his company have a commitment to employ people with Down syndrome and differing abilities so we are happy we could work with them on this project.” She added that “the socks are so beautiful. People will love them.” Cronin designed and created the world’s first Down Syndrome awareness socks in 2017. Since then, he has designed other Down Syndrome-themed socks and products. The company has also developed a Down Syndrome “super box” with products that are made by companies that are led by or employ people with Down Syndrome. In 2019, Cronin joined the board of the National Down Syndrome Society. He and his father, Mark Cronin, are part of the NDSS Ambassador’s Program.",

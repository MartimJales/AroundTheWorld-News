    "text": "TROUT RUN, Pa. — Children and their parents sing songs around a fire at [Camp Susque](https://susque.org/) in Lewis Township outside of Trout Run at the camp's Rain or Shine program. The program started this past fall and is currently in week two of the six-week spring session. \"It's a group of parents and kids who wanna get outside and explore God's creation together; we often are getting our hands dirty, and it's hands-on,\" said Stephanie Knauss, Coordinator of the School of Discovery at Camp Susque. The Rain or Shine program is for ages from two to eight. Activities during the program include campfire songs, exploring, and reading books based on the theme of the day. Stephanie Knauss, School of Discovery Coordinator at Camp Susque, says she started the program, so families with young school-aged children can explore the outdoors together. \"Camp Susque has beautiful grounds, a lot to offer, a variety of woodland, pond, fields, and so we have so much to work with here, and it's a great community,\" said Knauss. In addition to the Thursday rain or Shine event, the camp has an afternoon activity program for children of all ages. \"We use our climbing wall, our ropes course, kayaking, canoeing, archery, any outdoor activity you can think of, we have classes associated with it, a lot of art classes with our pottery studio, we have an observatory—so we do astronomy,\" said Peter Swift, Executive Director Camp Susque. All programs at the camp are possible through donations. Knauss tells Newswatch 16 that having a program like Rain or Shine gives children the opportunity to learn and grow. \"There's so many studies on sensory exploration and children taking initiative, taking risks, enjoying themselves outside, it's just all around healthy for them.\" The Rain or Shine program costs $45 for the six-week spring session. It meets every Thursday at 9:30 a.m. and runs until April.",

    "text": "> ELDRED, Pa. — Otto-Eldred School District agriculture teacher Brandon Witmer was recognized this week as a 2024 Northern Regional Golden Owl Award winner.\nAs regional winner, Witmer is one of four finalists statewide, with the overall winner to be recognized at the state Future Farmers of America (FFA) convention June 11 at Penn State University.\n“Mr. Witmer is a man who loves teaching agriculture and FFA,” said Mark Muir, an agribusiness insurance representative for Nationwide, which sponsors the awards. “He makes classes fun with the students and helps everybody learn the things they need to know about agriculture. This chapter is small, but impacts the whole school and surrounding areas. He loves helping each of his students. His willingness to help has created opportunities for students that, otherwise, they would not have.”\nStudents, fellow teachers and other supporters can nominate their favorite agricultural teacher for the Golden Owl Award, summarizing what makes him or her the best in their state. Witmer was awarded $500 and an engraved plaque as regional winner.\n“Mr. Witmer has been a rock star since taking the position at Otto-Eldred,” said Otto-Eldred Superintendent Matthew Splain. “He has built our program into a top-tier program in the state. Students, parents and community members appreciate his hard work, and we are grateful to recognize him for what he does.”\nSplain said there were several students — current and past — parents of students and community members who nominated Witmer.\nThe grand prize winner in June will receive the Golden Owl Award trophy and $3,000 as the state Agricultural Educator of the Year. In conjunction with the Golden Owl Award, Nationwide donates $5,000 to the state FFA to support the personal and professional growth of students, teachers and advisors alike.",

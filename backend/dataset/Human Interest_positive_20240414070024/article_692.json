    "text": "Select your country\nLast week, we featured\n[The Switch](/innovation-of-the-day/green-energy-installer-the-switch-trains-refugees-to-become-skilled-solar-technicians), a Dutch startup that trains refugees for jobs in the renewable energy sector. The company is back in the news, this time with an intriguing piece of design: Tiles of the Sun.\nTwo hand-painted ceramic tiles depict a solar installer standing on a roof with a photovoltaic panel hoisted on one shoulder. Tiles of the Sun, developed with creative agency 72 and Sunny, builds on a rich tradition of tiles portraying Dutch tradespeople like blacksmiths, shipwrights and carpenters, whose handiwork helped shape the nation.\nCrafted by artisans at the Harlinger Aardewerk en Tegelfabriek in the iconic blue-and-white Delft style, Tiles of the Sun pays homage to the skilled labor required for today's energy transition. By purchasing a tile for EUR 75 or more, buyers directly fund The Switch's training and certification programs for refugees looking to embark on green energy careers.\nTrend Bite\nIn November 2023, far-right populist Geert Wilders won the Netherlands' national elections after running a blatantly anti-asylum and anti-Islam campaign. The Switch, meanwhile, highlights the value refugees bring by upskilling them for a sector facing a severe labor shortage â€” the Netherlands is looking to fill around 50,000 job openings related to the energy transition.\nRaising funds for the endeavor with a quintessentially Dutch piece of heritage symbolizes a merging of old and new residents, of historic craft and today's technology. One to be inspired by?\nJoin 100,000+ future-focused professionals in 180 countries already receiving our free trend updates.",

    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris made a historic stop at Planned Parenthood's St. Paul facility with Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday in an election-year effort to underscore the commitment of President Joe Biden to reproductive care.\nThe vice president's office said the visit marks the first by a sitting president or vice president to a clinic that provides abortions, but Harris emphasized the broader scope of care provided there.\n\"Please do understand that when we talk about a clinic such as this it is absolutely about health care and reproductive health care so everyone get ready for the language: uterus,\" she said. \"That part of the body needs a lot of medical care, people.\"\nHarris briefly toured the facility with Walz, Dr. Sarah Traxler, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood North Central States; Ruth Richardson, Planned Parenthood's regional president and CEO; and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, who represents the area.\nThe vice president stopped for a few minutes to talk to the reporters packed into the reception room and drive home the administration's commitment to restoring the abortion protections the U.S. Supreme Court scrapped when it overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nShe thanked the clinic employees, Walz, McCollum and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter for maintaining access to care. She denounced restrictions in other states that prevent women from obtaining similar care \"within any reasonable distance\" of their home.\n\"I've heard stories of and met with women who've had miscarriages and women who were being denied emergency care because the health care providers there at an emergency room were afraid that, because of the laws in their state, that they could be criminalized, sent to prison for providing health care,\" she said.\n\"So I'm here at this health care clinic to uplift the work that is happening in Minnesota as an example of what true leadership looks like,\" she added.",

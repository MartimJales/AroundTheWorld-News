Acting in light of these studies, we aim to provide a pleasant, stress-free travel experience at our airport with therapy dogs.\"\nThe airport wants its guests to leave the airport happy and with unforgettable memories, he said: \"Our guests can meet our dogs all around the airport.\"\nUnderlining that there are similar projects in other parts of the world, Demirtas added that in addition to dogs, ponies do similar tasks at airports in the US and Canada.\n- ‘Training starts when they are puppies'\nVeterinarian Volkan Arslan said the dogs undergo training process for their job.\nSaying that five dogs have already successfully passed the training, Arslan said that the dogs started to be trained as puppies and that there are four more puppies now in the pipeline.\nArslan said that the trainers also took training and got certificates.\nSaying that they got positive reactions from passengers during the training process, Arslan said that they take care of the dogs' health and have monthly and weekly programs for this purpose.\n- ‘I've never seen something like this before'\nYunus Kizilaslan, a passenger, was pleased by the people-friendly pooches. \"It's a very nice program, we want it to continue. It's very nice that they are trained.\"\nChinese passenger Xi Yuki also adored the therapy dogs.\nSaying he found the project useful, Xi added: \"I love dogs and animals very much. I'm very happy to see them here. I never saw a program like this before.\"\n- Animal-friendly airport\nAt IGA Istanbul Airport, there are a total of four pet rooms, one at the departing passenger floor counter islands, two after passport control, and one at the arriving passenger floor, for the needs of small traveling animals.\nThe pet rooms are equipped with products such as cat and dog food, litter, and cat scratching boards.\n# IGA # Istanbul airport # therapy dogs",

    "text": "3 hours ago TULSA, Okla. â€” The Tulsa International Airport (TUL) unveiled a new children's play area Thursday morning.\nIn a partnership with Discovery Lab, TUL opened the new Tulsa Children's Museum Discovery Lab engagement area. This is the first kids' area at the airport post-security.\nThe play area is a free STEM themed zone with interactive learning activities.\nchildren's discovery lab TUL\nchildren's discovery lab TUL\nchildren's discovery lab TUL\nFOX23 attended the ribbon-cutting and spoke with airport and Discovery Lab representatives.\n\"Discovery Lab is excited to partner with Tulsa International Airport to bring a learning experience for families while they're waiting to make their connections or make their flights,\" said Ray Vandiver, executive director of Discovery Lab. \"Our exhibit designers have chosen a group of experiences that represent the style of learning that happens at Discovery Lab. So it's action-based learning, you learn by doing, full body, minds on.\nRay said the activities are designed to engage children's brains.\n\"You navigate through a vertical maze, it's physical, mental, there's a human circuit where you're the wires connecting the power supply to appliances,\" Ray said. \"So it's about playful learning, it's about science, technology, engineering and math learning, and it's all happening at the airport.\"\nFOX23 spoke with airport representatives, who said the play area is opening at the perfect time for travelers and their kids.\n\"We are expecting 114,000 passengers to pass through this airport during spring break,\" said Stephanie Chester, director of marketing and community relations for TUL. \"Our goal was to have this completed by spring break, we met our goal, we're super excited that the families that are traveling over the next week will have a place for their kiddos to burn some energy before they board their flight.\"\nStephanie said the play area's purpose is to not only provide an educational experience for kids but to improve the customer experience of parents as well.\n\"As a mother of two, something I always look for is what can my kiddos do before they board a flight where they have to remain still for an hour, two hours, three hours,\" Stephanie said. \"Being able to have this here for them is something that was a top priority for us.\"\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

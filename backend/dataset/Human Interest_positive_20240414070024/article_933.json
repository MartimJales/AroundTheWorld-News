    "text": "WICHITA, Kan. (KAKE) - A group of local families have made it their mission to send as many veterans on the Kansas Honor Flight as they can- by baking bread.\nAlmost everyone knows someone who has served in the military but a few local families want to honor the veterans in their family in an unconventional way.\n“It&apos;s super fun like baking and helping the veterans,” said Bristol Wright, a 10-year-old volunteer.\nVolunteers as young as 4 years old bake 6 varieties of bread to be sold for the Kansas Honor Flight.\nThe flights takes veterans on a completely free trip to Washington DC to visit their war memorials.\n“I like giving back to the people that served in the Air Force,” said Ryker Church, a 9-year-old volunteer.\n“We wanted to kinda teach our children and our grandchildren to give back and to be a part of the community as well. So we started doing the bread making last year and last year we raised 4,000 dollars and so we were able to send four veterans on the trip of a lifetime,” said fundraising organizer Candace Wright.\nLast year they sold more than 420 loaves of bread and the project grows each year.\nSo far this year they’ve used more than 1000 bananas, 100 pounds of flour, and 75 pounds of sugar during this massive baking challenge.\n“You have to stay on track and make sure you have every ingredient in and just have fun while doing it,” said Jaxon Ruark, a 13-year-old volunteer.",

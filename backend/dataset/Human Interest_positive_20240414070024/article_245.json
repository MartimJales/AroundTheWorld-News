    "text": "The celebrated movie Nyad is a remarkable true story about athlete Diana Nyad (played by Annette Bening). Nyad, at the age of 60, along with the help of her best friend, Bonnie Stoll (played by Jodie Foster), sets-out to conquer her dream of swimming from Cuba to Florida. It’s a daunting, yet overly inspiring story that screenwriter, Julia Cox brought to life. Cox recently received the Sun Valley Film Festival’s High Scribe Award, given to an individual with a profound insight. Idaho Today’s Mellisa Paul had the honor and pleasure of speaking with Julia Cox to not only hear how she paid honor to this larger than life true story, but what it was like working with two Hollywood heavy-weights like Jodie Foster and Annette Bening. The film Nyad has received multiple award nominations including The Golden Globes and most recently the Oscars. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n[Idaho Today](/section/idaho-today)\nA Conversation With The Screen Writer Of Oscar Nominated Film Nyad Starring Jodie Foster And Annette Bening\nThe celebrated movie Nyad is a remarkable true story about athlete Diana Nyad (played by Annette Bening).",

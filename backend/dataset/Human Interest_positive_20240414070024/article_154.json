    "text": "Washington On a sunny, spring afternoon this week, 400 school leaders descended on the nation’s Capitol to meet with their states’ legislators. They zipped across Capitol Hill, moving from one Senate building to the next, to advocate for more supports and funds for public schools via legislation. Principals petitioned their political leaders to co-sign bills on student and teacher mental health, expand educator pipelines, and find ways to extend ESSER-era funding, which must be spent by September 2024.\nBut more than specific bills, or agendas, the educators brought stories from their schools and communities—which, they believed, had more impact on legislators. Several principals said they made most headway with senators or aides whose parents had taught, or who had themselves studied teaching. Bills supporting more mental health resources for schools featured heavily in almost all conversations.\nChris Young, the principal of North Country Union High School in Newport, Vt., was on the Hill too, to advocate for just these issues. He had just been announced as the Advocacy Champion of the year by the National Association of Secondary School Principals, for his work to spotlight the mental health challenges—including substance abuse and suicide attempts—that his students face. He wore a bracelet of pale amber-colored beads to every meeting, named “Norah Beads” after grade 9 student Norah Jones died by suicide in his school in 2021.",

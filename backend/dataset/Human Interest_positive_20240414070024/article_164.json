When the trailer came out, everyone was amazed with the action scenes especially the ones with Sidharth Malhotra. Now, the first reviews of Yodha are out. It seems the movie is packed with drama and action. It is a neatly made film.\nFor all the TV News and Entertainment News updates, follow BollywoodLife on WhatsApp.\nYodha screening in the city\nToday, a screening of Yodha was held in Mumbai.

    "text": "With the onset of spring, a cool nostalgic twist is making its way to a Wendy’s near you. The Orange Dreamsicle Frosty, a new addition to the franchise’s menu , draws inspiration from the classic childhood popsicle. Launching on the first day of spring, which is Tuesday, March 19, the sweet treat will replace the Vanilla Frosty, but only for a limited time. (Feel free to let out a sigh of relief loyal fans because the Chocolate Frosty is here to stay.) If you’re curious to know what the new frosty will taste like, it’s a combination of the classic sweet orange flavor paired with the Vanilla Frosty base. People are also reading… “When you think of citrus, people think of summer, but it’s actually right now: late winter and spring. We wanted to use that as part of the inspiration,” John Li, Wendy’s Global VP of Culinary Innovation, told TODAY. Li added that the culinary team drew inspiration for its new menu item from the fragrance counter of all things. “I normally don’t do this, I’ll usually bring in food props, but I actually brought in something else. This is actually the cologne I wear,” Li said on the show, sharing a look at his bottle of Sephora’s Tangerine Boy. Li detailed to Today how cosmetics companies such as Ulta, Sephora , and Bath and Body Works are doing a stellar job of predicting where aroma and flavor trends are headed. “It’s these flavors that actually end up dictating the trends that actually are what resonate with our fans today,” Li told Today. “Tangerine Boy is a good example because they know that citrus is something that should be celebrated as a part of spring. We take those same exact elements that people are searching for and put it into food form.” “The eye-catching orange color of this delectable treat was inspired by the spring season, and it tastes just as good as it looks,” Wendy’s said in their news release, per Nations Restaurant News. The new addition will join other popular frosties that signify the season, such as the chain’s winter Peppermint Frosty, the summer Strawberry Frosty and the fall Pumpkin Spice Frosty.",

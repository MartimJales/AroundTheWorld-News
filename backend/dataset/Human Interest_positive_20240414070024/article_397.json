    "text": "junior-dion-celebrates-goal-with-teammate-augustine-mulenga-of-amazulu-fc16\nBoth teams made strategic changes from their previous matches, with Sekhukhune bringing in Katlego Mkhabela and Elias Mokwana, while AmaZulu introduced Junior Dion and Hendrick Ekstein to their starting line-up.\nThe match began cautiously, with chances sparse in the early stages. Sekhukhune had a golden opportunity midway through the first half when Chibuike Ohizu found himself with a free header, only to be denied by AmaZulu’s goalkeeper Veli Mothwa.\nHowever, it was AmaZulu who broke the deadlock in the 26th minute, as Junior Dion capitalized on a rebound to slot home from close range, giving his side a crucial 1-0 lead heading into half-time.\nAmaZulu emerged from the break with renewed vigour, and they quickly doubled their advantage in the 62nd minute. Victor Letsoalo pounced on a defensive error from Sekhukhune’s goalkeeper, Renaldo Leaner, to score into an empty net, making it 2-0 in favour of the visitors.\nDespite Sekhukhune’s late surge, with coach Lehlohonolo Seema making tactical substitutions to inject fresh energy into the midfield, they were unable to find a way past AmaZulu’s resolute defence.\nGoalkeeper Veli Mothwa produced a nervy save late in the game to preserve his clean sheet, ensuring AmaZulu’s comfortable progression to the quarter-finals.\nWith this impressive victory, AmaZulu now set their sights on the next challenge in their quest for Nedbank Cup glory.",

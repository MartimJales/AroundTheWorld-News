And since her recovery, she's been wanting to find a way to pay it forward through her Bat Mitzvah project. \"When I was in the hospital, everyone donated gifts to me,\" Gabbi Roosth told WPBF 25 News. And since her recovery, she's been wanting to find a way to pay it forward through her Bat Mitzvah project. \"When I was in the hospital, everyone donated gifts to me,\" Gabbi Roosth told WPBF 25 News. And since her recovery, she's been wanting to find a way to pay it forward through her Bat Mitzvah project. It's the one thing that stuck with 13-year-old Gabbi Roosth when she was recovering from spinal surgery at the Palm Beach Children's Hospital: receiving a toy every single day. \"When I was in the hospital, everyone donated gifts to me,\" the teenager told WPBF 25 News. And since her recovery, she has been looking for ways to give back to the community members who provided her with the care and comfort while she was a patient. The perfect opportunity came about when the seventh-grader was assigned her school's Mitzvah project this year. \"I made an Amazon wish list for all my friends and family to choose gifts for the kids in the hospital,\" she said. With the help of her parents, Roosth collected more than 2o0 toys at her Bat Mitzvah in February. \"After her surgery, she’d met with the life specialist, and they would bring her gifts on a daily basis,\" Kenneth Roosth, Gabbi's father, told WPBF 25 News. \"She’s a great kid, and I think it’s wonderful, like there’s so many teens they make it all about themselves. And I was just really proud that she wanted to think of others,\" Debbie Roosth, Gabbi's mother, said. The children's hospital gifts toys to all of its patients every day, and it's become something that families look forward to daily. \"It’s hard. And so, every day when the child life specialist would come in, it was very uplifting,\" the teen's mother said. \"They’re really short on toys for babies and teens. So, we kind of concentrated on those areas.\" While it may be just a toy to some, for these parents, it's become something that will bring a smile to their children's faces every day. \"It’s so impactful to me that her kindness and thoughtfulness and caring for gifts she’s going to give to children that she’s never met,\" Lisa Barron, the pediatric office supervisor at Palm Beach Children's Hospital, told WPBF 25 News. \"It is always inspiring when especially a young person wants to give back.\" \"She’s a regular teenage kid; she plays soccer and basketball, so she’s not having any issues,\" her father said. And today, Roosth is thinking of more ways to help others. \"It made feel really happy because like people cared about me,\" she said.

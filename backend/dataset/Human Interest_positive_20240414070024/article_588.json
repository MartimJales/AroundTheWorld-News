    "text": "PLAINS, Ga. (WALB) - A new 9/11 memorial is currently on display in former president Jimmy Carter’s hometown of Plains. That’s all thanks to a Boy Scout who spearheaded all the efforts to make it all possible.\n“It’s raw trade center steel. They pulled it right from the wreckage,” said Grady Young, a perspective Eagle Scout.\nGrady Young spent three years planning and organizing the 9/11 memorial that is now on display in Plains. (walb) Young has been in the Boy Scouts for several years now. He said three years ago he had to start coming up with an idea for his Eagle Scout project—a service project that members do to benefit their community. That’s when his grandmother shared the idea to collaborate with a September 11th organization to bring the historical monument to the small town.\n“The fundraising effort, it only took maybe three or four weeks for everything to come back in and get enough to pay for this monument,” he said.\nYoung raised close to $4,800 for the monument. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation based out of New York provided the actual steel that is shaped to look like the Twin Towers. Grady says it’s important to never forget everyone who lost their lives on that day.\n“I believe it will help the community remember the 9/11 attacks and help the community just have something else special for tourists to see, people who live here. I think it adds to the city pretty nicely,” he said.\nTunnel to Towers Foundation, a New York based organization, sent actual trade center steel recovered from the wreckage to go on the memorial. (walb) The monument not only pays tribute to 9/11 victims but also has a tie to former President Jimmy Carter. Words Carter said a year after the terrorist attacks are also engraved on the back of the monument.\n“Even in the face of potential harm, the United States must lead the fight to secure human rights for all peoples...” Young read off the memorial. “It’s one of those things that people in America--everyone remembers where they were. I wasn’t there but I feel strongly about it and I feel like it’s something we should always remember.”\nThe 9/11 memorial is something that Jill Stuckey, superintendent of the Jimmy Carter Historical Park, says Jimmy Carter would be proud of.\n“Oh he would be just thrilled that this is here in his hometown and I wish he could be here,” she said.\nYoung said he’s in the beginning stages of planning a ceremony on September 11 of this year to formally present this memorial to the community.\nA new 9/11 memorial is currently on display in the center of former president Jimmy Carter’s hometown of Plains.

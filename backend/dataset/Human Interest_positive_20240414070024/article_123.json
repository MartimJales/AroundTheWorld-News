There’s nothing salvageable for some people,” Bonneville said.\nShe headed to Connect Community Services, which is accepting monetary and physical donations for the long road to recovery ahead.\n“We are needing laundry detergent, and any kind of stain removal items for laundry. We are also beginning to collect linens, towels and bedding because when people get into permanent living situation, they’re going to need all of those items,” co-founder of Connect Community Services Gere Jester said.\nInez will have plenty more to give to this community she’s already made a big mark on.\n“It has shown us how wonderful humanity still is,” Jester said.",

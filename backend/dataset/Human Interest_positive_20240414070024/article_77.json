    "text": "Barkley 'super excited' about Eagles culture, fans Saquon Barkley praised the Philadelphia Eagles culture and what the franchise is building during his introductory press conference with the team on Thursday. \"When it came to my attention that the Eagles were a team that were interested in me, I definitely got excited about it,\" Barkley said, according to [SNY](https://twitter.com/SNYGiants/status/1768358466144403573). \" ... From watching from afar, everything that they're about, the culture here, the fans here, definitely got super excited about it, and I'm just happy to be a part of this organization.\" Barkley signed a three-year contract with Philadelphia in a surprise move on Monday following six seasons with one of the Eagles' biggest rivals, the New York Giants. The star tailback hit free agency after playing 2023 on a one-year contract. New York reportedly didn't offer him a new contract this offseason. The 2018 No. 2 pick has been one of the NFL's premier running backs when healthy. A two-time Pro Bowler, Barkley amassed 7,311 scrimmage yards and 47 total touchdowns in New York. The former Offensive Rookie of the Year topped the 2,000-yard mark during his freshman season in the league but has since battled multiple injuries and played just one full season since 2019. Despite missing three games in 2023, Barkley accounted for 1,242 yards and 10 touchdowns. He expects to have a big impact in Philly, too. \"I feel like I'm a special player,\" Barkley said, according to [Dave Zangaro of NBC Sports Philadelphia](https://twitter.com/DZangaroNBCS/status/1768377298045030568). \"I feel like I still got a lot left and I got a lot to prove. I just can't wait to get on the field with those guys and prove it and show it to the world.\" The Eagles began last season with a 10-1 record but weren't able to replicate that success in the final stretch and ultimately fell short against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the wild-card round. \"I know everyone is stuck on last year being 11-6 and making it to the first round (of the postseason) and that's a down year,\" Barkley said, per team reporter [Chris McPherson](https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/saquon-barkley-eagles-ive-got-a-lot-to-prove). \"That's a great culture to be a part of, when you have that mindset.\"",

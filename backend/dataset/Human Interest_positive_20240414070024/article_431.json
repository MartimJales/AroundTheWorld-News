    "text": "Thursday, March 14th 2024, 4:32 pm 75 Tulsans can now call themselves American citizens after the naturalization ceremony on Thursday morning. Since 2019, these ceremonies have been hosted in City Hall and even the Admiral Twin during the pandemic, but Thursday’s was held here at the Cox Business Center and welcomed oath-takers from all over the world. It was a day of celebration for Tulsans from 42 countries, all here for the moment many have been waiting for years to experience. \"After 7 years I finally have my citizenship,\" says Diego Wasdin. Wasdin came to Tulsa from Mexico to follow his dream of getting a college degree and becoming an American, celebrating as he walked across the stage with his certificate in hand. \"Oh it's a great great feeling,\" says Wasdin. This year Tulsa welcomed people from 7 countries never represented before at this ceremony, like Belarus and Chile. \"We call these the happiest places in Tulsa,\" says Krystal Reyes with the city of Tulsa. She says this event allows freshly minted Americans to fully embrace their city. \"We've been doing these for several years and it's just part of our efforts to make sure we're being an inclusive and welcoming city for our immigrant and refugee communities,\" says Reyes. For Diego, the long journey to citizenship was tough but made easier by a strong support group. \"I have this family here and it's great they've always been there for me and they've been a huge help and thanks to them I’m here,\" says Wasdin. He says while much of his family is still in Mexico, these friends helped him reach his goal. \"I wanted to be a citizen that's one of my dreams ... and I never gave up working towards that citizenship,\" says Wasdin. As soon as they left the ceremony citizens were able to exercise one of their new rights by registering to vote.

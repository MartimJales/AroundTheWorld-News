    "text": "The newest volunteers for the Volunteer Advocates for Seniors and Incapacitated Adults were sworn in to help those who can no longer manage their own affairs. Franciscan Health and the Lake County Courts partners to provide the service to seniors and the incapacitated who are unable to represent themselves in legal matters. Funded by the Indiana Supreme Court, Legacy Foundation, Inc. and other sources, it’s provided elder law and guardianship services to the community in Lake County for 22 years. Lake Superior Court Probate Commissioner Ben Ballou swore in three new VASIA volunteers. LaFayette Boone of Crown Point, Steven Bowling of Portage and Dr. Celeste McGill of Chicago will advocate for elderly and incapacitates adults, serving as their court-appointed agents. “You’re joining a family of very talented and special people,” VASIA Director LaVonne Jarrett said. People are also reading… The volunteers are screened and required to do 40 hours of initial training and then 12 hours of continuing education. “What you’re doing is so important to our community,” Ballou said. “You’re a voice for the voiceless. You advocate for people who don’t have anyone to advocate for them. From the court’s perspective, you’re filling a huge void for us.” The advocates work as guardians on just one case at a time so it has their full attention and they don’t get overextended. “You will see the dying,” VASIA Volunteer Coordinator Francisca Mendoza said during the swearing-in ceremony. “You will see the poor and you’ll see the unwanted, by society and their families, but you will become an extension of the family. They’ll look forward to your visits.” Bowling is a barber who cuts nursing home residents’ hair for free. “To get a blessing, you’ve got to be a blessing,” Bowling said. “I just like to make others happy.” Boone is a nurse and Navy veteran who said she likes to be of service. McGill is a professor at the City Colleges of Chicago who previously worked as a social worker. “I don’t think anyone’s socio-economic status should determine the kind of care, services and support they need and deserve,” McGill said. Lake Superior Court Judge Bruce Parent told the volunteers they are “doing God’s work.” “God sees all and His light is shining upon you all,” Parent said. “We very much appreciate you.” For more information, visit www.franciscanhealth.org/VASIA .

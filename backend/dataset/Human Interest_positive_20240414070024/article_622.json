Iwen Chu.\nWhile the presentations were given in Chinese, the Brooklyn Eagle managed to speak exclusively with hospital representatives before and after the event.\n“The purpose of cancer screening is to identify cancer in its early stages — or even precancerous lesions, which, if removed, would prevent cancer development,” explained Yiwu Huang, attending physician, Maimonides Cancer Center, and program director, hematology/oncology fellowship training program. He pointed out that the hospital has different screening programs for different types of cancer — be it breast, colon, or lung — the three most common and significant.\nLeave a Comment",

    "text": "Third seed Coco Gauff served 17 double faults but still beat China&apos;s Yuan Yue 6-4 6-3 to reach the Indian Wells semi-finals for the first time. A day after her 20th birthday, Gauff had to rally from 3-1 down in the second set on Thursday to book a meeting with ninth seed Maria Sakkari, who saw off American Emma Navarro 5-7 6-2 6-4. \"I&apos;m really happy to be through today&apos;s match,\" said one-time teen prodigy Gauff. \"It wasn&apos;t the best style of the serving, but overall I think when it comes to the groundstroke game and returns, everything else, honestly, I played well. I&apos;ll just try and take the positives into the next match.\" Gauff saved seven of the 10 break points through the match, including three to avoid going 4-1 down in the second set. \"I pretty much just relied on me just out-rallying her and being aggressive,\" Gauff added. \"I think a lot of break points that were saved, at least in that second set, I just remember hitting a lot of forehand winners.\" Gauff joined Iga Swiatek and Caroline Wozniacki as the only players to have reached five WTA 1000 semi-finals before the age of 21. Top seed Swiatek earlier reached the semi-finals after former world number one Wozniacki retired with a foot injury early in the second set of their quarter-final. Wozniacki started strongly in building a 4-1 lead but was soon left frustrated as Swiatek produced a barrage of winners to storm back and win the set 6-4. The Dane, who returned to the circuit last year after taking a three-year break to start a family, had a medical time-out to have her right foot re-strapped at the end of the first set. That failed to improve the situation and, down 1-0 in the second, she gestured to her opponent that she was unable to continue. \"I have a huge respect for her and I&apos;m sad she has to go that way, I&apos;m sure she will recover and I hope she will be ready for Miami,\" Swiatek said. \"But I&apos;m happy that I played well enough in first set to win it.\" Swiatek, the 2022 champion, will face Marta Kostyuk in the semi-finals after the Ukrainian defeated Anastasia Potapova 6-0 7-5. \"Let&apos;s not put expectations too high,\" world number 32 Kostyuk said of her meeting with Swiatek. \"She&apos;s a great competitor, she&apos;s been on top of the game for two years already.\" Sakkari closed out the evening with a comeback win over Navarro to reach the semis for the third straight year. \"That was the toughest match I&apos;ve played in a while,\" said Sakkari. \"I&apos;m very happy I found a way to win this match today.\"",

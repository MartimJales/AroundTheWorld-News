    "text": "LAS VEGAS — Needing a sweep through the Pac-12 Tournament to become the NCAA Tournament team they were expected to be, USC had a clear motivational edge over Arizona on Thursday. Except in one area. Arizona has never lost back-to-back games under third-year coach Tommy Lloyd and the Wildcats weren’t about to end that trend Thursday, avenging a loss at USC on Saturday by smashing the Trojans 70-49 in a Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinal game at T-Mobile Arena. The win moved UA to 25-7 and into a Pac-12 semifinal game Friday at 5 p.m. against the winner of Thursday afternoon’s UCLA-Oregon game. Arizona shot 45.6% from the field, while holding USC to just 35.7% shooting and outrebounding the Trojans 44-30. KJ Lewis had 15 points off the bench to lead UA in scoring while Jaden Bradley added 12 in reserve, while Oumar Ballo had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Leading by 12 at halftime, Arizona first took a 20-point lead, 44-24, when KJ Lewis grabbed a rebound of Caleb Love’s missed shot and made a second-chance layup. But Bradley later starred in a sequence that gave UA a 54-32 lead and brought the T-Mobile “McKale” crowd to a roar. Bradley drove through the USC defense for a layup to make it a 52-32 lead and then, while guarding USC’s Isaiah Collier as he drove around USC center Joshua Morgan, lunged to tap the ball out of Morgan’s hands. The ball rolled to UA forward Pelle Larsson in the center of the lane and Larsson fired it back to Bradley as he led on a break, with Bradley then turning into an emphatic dunk that gave UA a 54-32 lead. USC called a timeout after the play, and the celebration began, with Lewis gesturing with his hands up toward the UA fans. Less than a minute after the timeout, USC standout guard Boogie Ellis fouled out, having scored just six points on 2-for-11 shooting and the Trojans were all but done at that point. USC cut UA’s lead to 60-43 with 3:42 left but Pelle Larsson hit a 3-pointer to put the Wildcats back ahead by 20 and didn't lose ground the rest of the way. Bogged down in a sloppy, defensive-minded game early, the Wildcats managed a 28-16 halftime lead. The Wildcats shot just 38.5% from the field but held USC to just 23.3%, while the Trojans made just 2 of 12 3-pointers. Sun Devils: What went wrong with ASU basketball, what does Bobby Hurley do next? Ballo led the Wildcats before halftime with seven points and seven rebounds. Committing six turnovers in the first 10 minutes of the game, Arizona couldn’t establish an early rhythm, with the game in a 10-10 tie after Boogie Ellis hit a 3-pointer with 12:49 left in the half. USC later pulled within 16-14 on a driving layup from Isaiah Collier before Arizona began gradually expanding its lead. The Wildcats went ahead 23-17 with 3:49 left when Larsson hit an unguarded 3-pointer on the break while Caleb Love later added a 3-pointer for the Wildcats' 12-point halftime advantage with 26 seconds left before halftime.",

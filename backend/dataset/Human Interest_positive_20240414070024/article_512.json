    "text": "By Elaine Rojas-Castillo ,\n5 hours ago A Milwaukee bus driver sprang into action when he spotted a little boy running half-clothed on Capitol Drive, one of the busiest stretches of roadway in our area.\nKeyon Finkley says he spotted the child while driving his normal route in February.\nTMJ4 Keyon Finkley, the MCTS driver that saved a little boy on Capitol Dr. “I got scared and instantly went into Daddy mode,” said Finkley.\nFootage shared by the Milwaukee County Transit Authority shows the little boy walking barefoot along the road.\nSeconds later, Finkley pulls over into the bike lane and scoops the toddler out of the way before he could make his way to the intersection.\n“They trained to look two or three blocks ahead to be able to know everything around us. I saw the little boy starting to come out on my right side and start to run into traffic,” said Finkley.\nAfter placing the boy in his seat while they waited for police, Finkley says he couldn’t help but think about his own four children.\n“That could have been my son who somehow got out of the house. I would want someone to be there for my son so I had to be there for that boy and treat him like he was my son and protect him the best I can until the police get there,” said Finkley.\nMCTS says the little boy was the fourteenth child one of their drivers has saved in recent years.\nMilwaukee Police confirmed the boy wasn't hurt and they were able to safely reunite him with his family.",

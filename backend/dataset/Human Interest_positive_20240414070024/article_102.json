    "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- Trend News Agency) BAKU, Azerbaijan, March 14. I have high expectations for the XI Global Baku Forum, said Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Maimunah Mohd Sharif to Trend on the sidelines of the forum. \"I hope that we can find solutions to global challenges. Additionally, I advocate for a more cohesive approach toward addressing the climate agenda. We must exchange knowledge and learn from one another on these matters,\" she said. The XI Global Baku Forum is attended by representatives of many countries and prestigious international organizations, with more than 350 guests from more than 70 countries. The forum, which will run by March 16, will participate in global discussions about the outcomes of COP28 and the preparation for COP29. It will discuss causes endangering the evolving world order, including security concerns and peace possibilities, as well as initiatives to promote stability in a tumultuous global landscape and the consequences. Additionally, it will investigate solutions to handle impending issues, tackle critical conflicts and megathreats, and cover climate, food, and nuclear security concerns. Moreover, discussions will encompass the role of military and economic alliances in global governance, regional viewpoints, relationships with the EU and neighboring states, youth policies, strategies for enhancing resilience against global challenges, and addressing issues of inequality, natural resource scarcity, and migration dynamics.

    "text": "BOONE COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) - A West Virginia veteran wounded during his tour in Iraq opened the literal door to a new chapter in life Thursday. Robert Cowan, an Army veteran, received a new, mortgage-free, fully-furnished, home in Danville from the Military Warriors Support Foundation along with Bank of America. Cowan joined the U.S. Army in 1993. He served as a medic in high-risk obstetrics and labor & delivery, with Armor, Infantry, Recon, and Psy Ops. During his deployment to Iraq in December 2004, Robert was wounded in combat and medically retired after 16 years of service in 2009. After going through the application process, the organization found Robert to be the perfect candidate for a new home. “These guys like Robert have laid their lives on the line, they’ve laid it all out with the sacrifice that they had,” said Dave Lieske of Military Warriors Support. “It means a great deal to be able to give back, that’s why we do what we do because we want to give back to these guys.” Cowan said while the home will make his life easier, he’ll move forward thinking of those he served with who were lost along the way. “I appreciate it more than I can ever say, but the heroes are the friends who didn’t come back and, I just did my job,” he said. Though he’s not certain what his next steps will be, he is looking forward to his new life in Danville. “There’s a lot to discover and it’s going to be great, it’s going to be an adventure.” Robert said now that a home is taken care of he’s hoping to go back to school to seek a new degree.

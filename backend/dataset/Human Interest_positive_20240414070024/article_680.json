She joined her high school's varsity team as a seventh-grader. She made her international debut and scored six goals for the U17 USWNT at the 2022 Concacaf Championship. She was also named captain for the USWNT U19 team at the 2023 PanAm games. The Current signed her in December 2023, when she was 17 years-old.\nIzzy Rodriguez, defender\nKC Current's Izzy Rodriguez reads letter to younger self Heading into her third season with the Current, Izzy Rodriguez provides a boost to the backfield. She made 26 appearances during her rookie season in 2022, as the team made a run to the NWSL Championship game, ultimately losing to Portland Thorns FC. Last season, she played in every match for the Current.\nKristen Hamilton, forward\nKC Current's Kristen Hamilton reads letter to younger self Since making her professional debut in 2012, Kristen Hamilton has been a dependable scorer on each of her teams.

She is the all-time NWSL leader in Championship game appearances, including an appearance in the 2022 Championship game for the Current.\nElizabeth Ball, defender\nKC Current's Elizabeth Ball reads letter to younger self Elizabeth Ball has been with the Current since its debut season in 2021.

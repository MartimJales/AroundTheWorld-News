    "text": "Dramatic comeback seals important win for Slovenia against Brazil 14 Mar. 2024 Slovenia sealed a dramatic comeback and enhanced their chances to progress to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, after clinching a 27:26 win against Brazil, with the winner coming from right wing Domen Novak with three seconds to go. Olympic Qualification Tournament #1 Slovenia vs Brazil 27:26 (13:12) This was always going to be the pivotal match of the Olympic Qualification Tournament #1 in Granollers, with Spain big favourites and Bahrain the underdogs, therefore a win here would have cemented the chances of progression for Paris 2024 for either Brazil or Slovenia. There was no surprise that the two teams engaged in a hugely entertaining battle for the casual fans and a heart wrecking one for their own fans, with the two sides excelling on defence and trading blows throughout the whole of the first half. While Slovenia were always in the lead, Brazil were close every time, matching their opponents’ effort throughout the first 30 minutes. Slovenia’s biggest advantage was their experience and depth, with the likes of Dean Bombac, Borut Mackovsek and Miha Zarabec on the court making the difference, but Brazil’s exuberance and sheer desire balanced the tides. Slovenia did take a two-goal lead multiple times, but Brazil were always there, as goalkeeper Rangel da Rosa had an exciting performance and kept his side close. Thrice did Brazil have the chance to take the lead midpoint in the first half, but failed through missed shots or turnovers, enabling a plucky Slovenia side, which had some aces upon their sleeve, with Blaz Janc playing outside of his usual position, switched on the right back, shining. A 13:12 lead at the break for Slovenia morphed into a four-goal, 19:15 lead after 12 minutes into the second half, with Bombac, Mackovsek and Janc scoring three goals each, as the European side looked in total control and forced Brazil’s coach, Marcus Oliveira, to take a time-out to calm his side. Not only the time-out had the desired effect, but it proved to be a pivotal moment of the match, enabling Brazil to go on a 6:0 unanswered run, with Slovenia failing to score between the 42nd and the 50th minutes, as six different Brazil players scored to turn the game on its head. With less than 11 minutes to go, Brazil were up by two goals and it looked like they had all the momentum, with everything what Slovenia did looked like it was going to turn to dust, especially as Uros Zorman side’s defence began to crumble, with suspensions conceded by stalwarts Blaz Blagotinsek and Borut Mackovsek. Brazil kept that momentum and were still two goals up with seven minutes to go, but this is where Slovenia started their arduous path to a comeback. From that moment on, the European side conceded only one goal and scored four, in a dramatic turnaround, which can be crucial for their chances of qualifying to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Blaz Janc, the hummel Player of the Match, scored one of the goals, while Aleks Vlah scored another one, but the dramatic finish was not for the fainthearted. As a draw would have seen the two side engage in a tough battle in the next two matches, Slovenia had the final possession, converting the final shot with three seconds to go, with right wing Domen Novak scoring his first goal of the match. Slovenia are now in a prime position to progress to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, returning to the competition for the first time since 2016, while Brazil need two wins against Spain and Bahrain to even contemplate progressing to the final competition. hummel Player of the Match: Blaz Janc (Slovenia)",

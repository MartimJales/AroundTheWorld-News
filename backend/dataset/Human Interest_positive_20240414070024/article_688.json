    "text": "MSU student creates app to help with parking tickets on campus EAST LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Getting a parking ticket is something no one enjoys. Students at Michigan State University (MSU) feel the same, especially after a long day of class. The cost of a citation depends on the parking lot; it could be $20, or it could be $50. An MSU student saw this problem, and developed an app to help fix it. Keshav Babu created the app, Ticket Time, which allows for users to report when parking enforcement is in the area. This helps students and visitors make sure they don’t get a parking ticket, by allowing them to buy extra time on their parking if they need it. “So the way that the app works is you just hop on the app, and you report where parking enforcement is,” said Babu. “Let’s say you see parking enforcement in lot 79. When someone reports it, we actually send a notification out of everyone whose parked at lot 79.” Babu said he created the app originally for a coding competition but ended up losing. He was inspired to continue its production by a friend of his, who drove him places in the past. “He used to get a lot of parking tickets, and he told me about them, and I’ve been there for a lot of them,” said Babu. MSU student Truman Langois said parking tickets on campus are an issue, with it being hard to pay for them on top of everything else students pay for. “Especially as a student, you got to pay for food and all sorts of other stuff, and now you got to pay upwards of $40 to pay a ticket sometimes,” said Langois. Truman added that students who commute to campus have an even harder time. Getting multiple parking tickets can be tough on them. MSU was reached out to regarding this issue but did not respond.

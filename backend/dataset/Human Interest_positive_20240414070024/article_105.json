Yousef Al Jaber, Vice President Innovation and Change Management at TotalEnergies EP Qatar and a sponsor of TWICE Qatar (TotalEnergies Women's Initiative for Communication and Exchange) delivered the opening speech saying:“I am proud to celebrate the remarkable women in our lives and workplaces. It's through our collective efforts and commitment that we can nurture a culture where diversity and inclusion, regardless of gender, is a fabric of the local community and Company ethos, and where everyone can thrive.” The event featured engaging workshops aimed at fostering creativity and teamwork. Life and Executive Coach Asmaa Al Kuwari led a thought-provoking session on empowering feminine confidence in the workplace, including a brainstorm on the essence of confidence. Another highlight was the interactive 'Art Gallery' team exercise and 'Marshmallow Challenge', tasking teams to construct the tallest structure using limited resources, as a fun and innovative exercise in collaboration and problem-solving. Guest speaker Maryam Al Kaabi, Chief Administration and Personnel Officer (CAPO) at North Oil Company, delivered an impactful speech on navigating career progression in male-dominated fields.

    "text": "GREENVILLE, S.C. (FOX Carolina) -In Laurens District 55, Josephine McWilliams is a familiar face at Ford Elementary. For over ten years, she’s been a foster grandparent, lending a hand to teachers and bringing extra love to the kids. McWilliams isn’t your typical grandma. Every year, she finds herself embracing a new group of children, becoming their “Grandma” at school. Lindsey Savage, a teacher, says McWilliams is like family to her class, offering hugs and guidance just like a real grandma would. Even being that grandmother for Savage. “It fills a void, I’ve lost both sets of my grandparents and…that’s my grandma, she’s been my grandma, might get emotional. She’s been my grandma for 15 years she’s done everything with me,” Savage said. For McWilliams, being a foster grandparent is more than just a role. It’s a source of joy, especially as she reflects on her own grandchildren. “My oldest granddaughter in France she’s in her third year of law school , her brother he’s a mixologist you know what that is and the baby girl she’s home, she’s a daddy’s girl,” Savage said. The children bringing a little extra joy to McWilliams life. “It’s just rewarding and fun to do, just deal with the kids and they are adorable you know. Sometimes little rugrats hahaha but they are really fun to be with,” McWilliams said. Savages and McWilliams bond goes beyond the classroom. “we’ve experienced holidays together, cookouts together. She’s come to my wedding,” Savage said. “Are you still with Ms.. Savage? And I said, yes, I’m not going anywhere. And I know she’s not going to kick me out. Are you Ms.. Savage? No. So it’s just rewarding,” McWilliams said. Copyright 2024 WHNS. All rights reserved.",

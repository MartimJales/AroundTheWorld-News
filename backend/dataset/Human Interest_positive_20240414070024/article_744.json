    "text": "At the heart of Trinity University's liberal arts ethos lies a commitment to inspiring curious, confident, creative minds, where students are encouraged to explore diverse perspectives and apply their knowledge in real-world settings. This semester marks the fifth year of collaboration between [Donald F. Van Eynde](/directory/vaneynde), Ph.D., professor emeritus of management; [Barbara Bentley](/directory/bbentley), SHRM-SCP and senior director of human resources at HUB San Antonio and adjunct professor of human resource (HR) management; and [Robert Scherer](/directory/rscherer), Ph.D., dean of the [Neidorff School of Business](https://www.trinity.edu/academics/departments/school-business) (NSB). Together, they are spearheading the capstone for the [HR management major](/academics/departments/michael-neidorff-school-business/human-resource-management-bs), which is the newest major within the NSB. In this capstone, students take on the role of consultants for small nonprofit organizations in our community that lack full-time HR management. Through this hands-on experience, they delve into research, craft solutions, and deliver comprehensive consulting reports along with implementation materials tailored to each organization's specific needs. The scope of their work encompasses various HR areas such as audits, performance appraisal system design, compensation market studies, and total rewards strategies. This year, the NSB was proud to partner with three esteemed nonprofit organizations: [Say Sí](https://saysi.org/), [Alamo City Arts](https://www.alamocityperformingartsassociation.com/), and [Arboretum San Antonio](https://www.arboretumsa.org/). These collaborations have been made possible through Trinity's close ties with the [Nonprofit Council of San Antonio](https://tncouncil.org/). A few weeks ago, a dynamic consulting duo of fourth-year HR management majors, Katie Hoang '24 and Brayden Espinoza '24, had the privilege of meeting with Say Sí's executive director, Stephanie LaFrocsia '05, and operations manager, Lindsey Byrne, at the organization's campus near downtown San Antonio. Hoang and Espinoza are currently conducting a comprehensive HR audit of the organization's policies and processes, with a focus on aligning them with industry best practices and standards and offering tailored recommendations for improvement. The success of Trinity's hands-on learning experiences is not merely anecdotal; it's quantifiable. With a 100% certification rate on the SHRM-CP exam and an employment rate mirroring that success for aspiring HR professionals, NSB stands as a beacon for nurturing socially conscious leaders equipped to tackle the complex challenges of the industry. As we celebrate the accomplishments of our students and their impactful contributions to our community partners, we take pride in the unique blend of business savvy and liberal arts sensibility that defines the Neidorff School of Business. The above photo was taken in front of Say Sí's downtown campus.",

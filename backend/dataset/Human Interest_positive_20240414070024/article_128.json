    "text": "> FRANKLINVILLE — The Franklinville Central School District/Ten Broeck Academy chapter of the National Honor Society welcomed its newest members recently in a ceremony at the school auditorium.\nFourteen students from the junior and senior classes demonstrated not only academic excellence but a commitment to leadership, service and character — the principles of the nationally recognized organization’s four pillars.\nThe 2024 inductees are Norra Ainsworth, Bretton Blecha, Lilah Cudney, Tyrnan Farrington, Audree Green, Ana Hillman, Braeden Kent, Patience Koch-Brauen, Elizabeth Price, William Slavinski, Shea Smith, Abigail Spencer, Matthew Spittler and Isaac Towne.\nThe new inductees join the nine current students inducted in 2023, who played a crucial role in guiding and leading the induction ceremony, said Susan Schifley, NHS advisor.\n“Their presence added a sense of camaraderie and support as family, friends and classmates gathered to witness this significant milestone,” she said.\nUnder the guidance of Schifley and the leadership of the current members, ceremony attendees observed as the new members lit their candles, recited the NHS pledge and officially became members.\nAs these students embark on this new chapter of their academic journey, school officials anticipate that they will continue to make meaningful contributions to both their school and the community.\n“A huge thank you to the faculty council for evaluating the applications and then selecting the students who embody the four pillars of NHS,” Schifley said. “Our current members did an awesome job leading the ceremony, and our 14 new members look to have great promise.”",

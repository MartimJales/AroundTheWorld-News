    "text": "(Shreveport, LA) – United Way of Northwest Louisiana (UWNWLA) and area businesses celebrated the $1.9 million raised for Northwest Louisiana programs on March 7 at the organization’s annual event, Tails and Ales: A Celebration of Impact. The event celebrates an impact value of nearly ten million for our community, helping more than 100,000 lives. Allocations of the funds are made to UWNWLA programs and nonprofit services that work to serve ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) citizens.\nUWNWLA’s largest fundraising initiative is its annual campaign, where UWNWLA partners with companies to conduct workplace fundraisers. Campaigns allow employees to give back each year and connect to causes they care about. While this is a major source of revenue for the organization, Tails & Ales honors the hundreds of businesses and organizations that implement change in our community through not only workplace campaigns but also volunteer engagement and advocacy.\n“Part of a true United Way Campaign goes beyond the pledge form,” said UWNWLA President & CEO LaToria W. Thomas. “We are grateful to have supporters who truly know what it means to Live United and embody the United Way spirit through their advocacy, volunteerism, and support. They preach, live, and breathe our mission and are the reason for our success. We are honored and eager to celebrate them every year.”\nTails and Ales took place at Margaritaville Resort Casino Bossier City in its Paradise Theater, where attendees enjoyed a seafood boil, live music by Professor Porkchop and the Dirty Dishes, beverages from local breweries, cornhole, raffle prizes, and a program recognizing honorees, including the recipient of the distinguished Clyde E. Fant Memorial Award. The Clyde E. Fant Award recognizes an individual who has contributed to the community and UWNWLA through leadership, campaign, or other volunteer efforts. This year, UWNWLA honored Grant Nuckolls and Andrew Crawford, co-owners of Cuban Liquor, for the significant impact they made through their Rare Whisky Raffle, which raised $28,000 for UWNWLA’s education program, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. The Clyde E. Fant Memorial Award has been awarded to community philanthropists since 1949. Former recipients include Virginia K. Shehee, 1975, Mary Ann Selber, 2001, and Jaf Fielder, 2023.",

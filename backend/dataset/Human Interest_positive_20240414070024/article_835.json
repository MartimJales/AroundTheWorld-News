    "text": "When Marine Sgt. Amed Issa heard gunshots while at a bar in Honolulu with his friend, he at first assumed they were fireworks. After all, it was Jan. 6, 2023, only a few days after New Year’s.Then Issa saw two men with guns just outside. He dashed toward them.His actions that night would save the life of a man who had been shot 23 times, according to the victim — and, a little more than a year later, would earn him the Marine Corps’ top award for noncombat heroism .",

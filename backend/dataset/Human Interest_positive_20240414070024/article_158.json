    "text": "Abandoned black bear cub in Mississippi finds new home WILKINSON COUNTY, Miss. (WLBT) - An orphaned bear cub has a new home thanks to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks. According to MDWFP, their Black Bear Program recently rescued and rehomed an abandoned black bear cub from the South Delta to a new den in Wilkinson County. The cub was unexpectedly abandoned following a routine den check where MDWFP biologists conducted a workup on the first-time mother and cub. MDWFP says because of rainstorms and the mother not returning, biologists decided to go back to the den site to rescue the cub and relocate it to Wilkinson County. “MDWFP is committed to the conservation of Mississippi’s native wildlife and is proud to have been able to safely rehome the abandoned cub,” a release said. The Black Bear Program has been conducting den checks since 2003. Want more WLBT news in your inbox? [Click here](https://www.wlbt.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our newsletter.

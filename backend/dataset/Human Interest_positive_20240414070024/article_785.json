    "text": "They were truly the first responders. In 1967, Pittsburgh produced America's first EMT service: Freedom House Ambulance. This groundbreaking work, performed solely by Black men and women from the Hill District, became the basis for all paramedic training in the country. Their story is told in the Mid-Atlantic Emmy-winning film [Freedom House Ambulance: The FIRST Responders](https://thelindsaytheater.org/films/freedom-house-ambulance-the-first-responders/), produced by Annette Banks of [WQED-TV](https://www.wqed.org/), and screening Thursday, March 28, at 7 p.m., as part of [The Lindsay Theater](https://thelindsaytheater.org/) and Cultural Center's Emerging Filmmakers Showcase. The free showcase events, a staple at The Lindsay, are designed to accelerate filmmakers' exposure and encourage exchanges between local artists and the public. \"The Lindsay is thrilled to present Freedom House Ambulance: The FIRST Responders as part of its Emerging Filmmakers Showcase, helping to bring this piece of local history to the public's attention,\" says Carolina Thor, the Theater's CEO. \"We are particularly honored to have some of these trailblazers in attendance.\" A Q&A after the screening will include filmmaker Banks, Freedom House founder Phil Hallen, and former Freedom House employee John Moon. Using rare archival images, the 28-minute documentary explores barriers faced by Freedom House Ambulance, from Hallen's story of inception to compelling reflections of the paramedic team, stories of the world-renowned doctors who trained them, and memories of the residents they served. \"When I first learned about Freedom House Ambulance, I knew that I had to tell this story,\" Banks says. \"It was a little-known local story, with major national impact. It was really exciting to meet some of the men and women from Freedom House who set the standard of pre-hospital care for our country, and it was such a privilege to be able to produce the documentary to help spread the word about this amazing part of American history.\" Despite the success of Freedom House Ambulance, racism and power dynamics shut it down, and faded its recognition in American history. Upcoming Local Events Freedom House: The FIRST Responders is \"truly spectacular and a must-see for everyone in Pittsburgh and beyond,\" says the Safar Center for Resuscitation Research at the University of Pittsburgh. \"The Freedom House team of men and women completely transformed the field of emergency medicine,\" observes BikePGH. \"The model they created was replicated all over the country … it's the basis for the city-run ambulance service today. And the documentary lets us hear from the people who made their neighborhood safer, those who were on the team themselves.\" This event is free to the public but [RSVPs](https://ticketing.useast.veezi.com/purchase/22310?siteToken=6avxdqr7sn7fr75807a5k307jm) are requested so that seating for everyone can be ensured.

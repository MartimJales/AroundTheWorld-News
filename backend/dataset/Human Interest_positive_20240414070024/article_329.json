    "text": "Two Businesses Team Up to Save Corry Easter Festivities Ryan Sander and Samantha Clabbatz were scrolling through Facebook when something caught their attention. \"Just kind of seeing the negative impact that it was having on the community, the poor feedback that it was getting,\" said Ryan Sander, owner of Sander Land & Home Realty. A post from the Corry Area Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday announced the cancellation of its Easter Egg Hunt and Easter Bunny Breakfast events. \"My heart went out to them,\" said Samantha Clabbatz, co-founder of French Creek Settlement Services. \"The lack of volunteerism in the community is tough.\" The Chamber of Commerce said its shift in focus to downtown businesses, along with the rising costs of candy, prizes and materials, were factors in the decision-making. Immediately after seeing the post, however, Clabbatz and Sander decided to sit down and come up with a plan: an Easter Egg Hunt at Mead Park on Saturday, March 30th at 11 a.m. \"There's been a few really heartfelt reactions that have been kind of tear-jerker,\" Clabbatz said. One Corry resident recalls the same Easter egg hunts when she was a child at Mead Park, ecstatic to hear the event is making a return to the community. \"They were amazing because we hung out with our friends beforehand, we hung out with their friends after,\" Tyleeza Reagle said. \"It was just fun and exciting during the Easter break to see all your friends again because that was when you [had] a longer Easter break.\" As downtown Corry prepares for the holiday in late March, the Easter Bunny will make an appearance at the event and take pictures with kids. \"We're actually working with the Chamber of Commerce,\" Clabbatz said. \"They've agreed to give us all of their eggs, their costumes and all of their signage.\"",

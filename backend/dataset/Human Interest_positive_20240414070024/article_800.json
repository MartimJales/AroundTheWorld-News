    "text": "Talk about a historic clip!\nOver 35 years ago back in 1988, Donald Trump went on Oprah’s TV show and they had an incredible chat.\nYou can see Oprah fawning all over Donald….\nThey all LOVED him before he ran for President!\nAnd speaking of running for President, Oprah asked him if he ever thought he’d run.\nListen as he tells Oprah he has no desire to run for President because it’s a tough life, but then he says he would never close the door on it in case things got so bad in America that he had to.\nWhat a wise man…\nHe kept the door open because he could see even back then the direction America was going.\nWatch here:\nDonald Trump talks America First with\n[@Oprah]— back in 1988.

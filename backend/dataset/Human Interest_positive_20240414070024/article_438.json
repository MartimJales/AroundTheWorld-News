    "text": "WATERTOWN — Celebrating 25 years, the North Country Chili Cook-Off was held on Feb. 24 at the Dulles State Office Building and hundreds were in attendance to warm up with sample-sized chili, cornbread, music and more.\n“I’m here to enjoy some chili, drinks and music,” Watertown resident Donald Mott said. “This is probably our fourth or fifth year attending. It’s for a great cause, and we get to sample great food.”\nBenefiting the Volunteer Transportation Center, and supported by Operation Yellow Ribbon, it was once a one-day event in Watertown, and then during the COVID-19 pandemic, the event turned into a “pub crawl” format that spanned for a month. Now, it’s hybrid and celebrates both the new and old methods of competition with more than 30 restaurants and businesses participating from Jefferson, Lewis and St. Lawrence counties.\nSpeaking of competition, some participants take it seriously. Melissa and Chris Fitzgerald of Clayton are no strangers to winning and they were very interested in placing in their respective category again this year. “This is our fourth year in the vegetarian category,” said Mrs. Fitzgerald. They won third place the first year of competition and then first place the next two tries. “We are excited to be here supporting the Volunteer Transportation Center while enjoying the competition,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.\nThis year the couple won the Best Vegetarian award.\nFor the in-person competition, entries were scored by a panel of judges and winners received plaques and cash prizes. For the “pub crawl” format, people were able to vote in person and online.\nThe Top Fundraiser Award, for fourth year in a row, went to Meme’s Diner in Felts Mills, which raised $1,500 in donations for the VTC.\nVTC reported that an estimated $40,000 was raised during the event.\n“It was an amazing day to celebrate 25 years the North Country Chili Cook-Off,” said cook-off chairperson Amy McEathron said in a press release following the event. “We had a great turnout, with everyone coming together for a good cause.”\nFor a full list of winners, sponsors and participants, visit Volunteer Transportation Center’s website www.volunteertransportationcenter.org or Facebook.com/VolunteerTransportationCenter .\nEditor’s note: Kathy Taber-Montgomery and Elaine M. Avallone contributed to this article.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",

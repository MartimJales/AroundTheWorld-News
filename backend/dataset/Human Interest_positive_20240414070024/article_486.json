    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. While it is the third leading cancer in the United States, many are still reluctant to get their screening which is encouraged at age 45. Dr. Cristina Hill Jensen, a board-certified gastroenterologist, explained some of the things to be aware of and prepare for. “I typically will tell patients to avoid some of the higher fiber foods for a few days prior to the procedure,” Dr. Hill Jensen said. “The day prior to the procedure is a clear liquid diet, so no food at all.” Dr. Hill Jensen also tells patients to avoid red or purple drinks to avoid confusion of blood in a stool sample. The preparation and actual procedure can make for a long day, but Dr. Hill Jensen says the procedure is much easier than the prep. The reason is they do not want to miss any type of color or polyps. When the procedure is complete, typically a patient will wake up within 5-10 minutes, have a small snack, and make sure everything is copacetic moving forward.\nCopyright 2024 KSFY.

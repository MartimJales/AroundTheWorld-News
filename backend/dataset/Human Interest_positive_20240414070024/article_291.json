    "text": "Trending Videos Close this video player Photo: Getty Images\nKate Middleton and Prince William are continuing to go about their lives , despite the public's concern for Middleton's well-being, incessant internet fodder, and that Photoshop controversy . In fact, Middleton isn't even all that worried about the wild headlines and viral conspiracy theories .\nOn Wednesday, a royal source told Harper's Bazaar that the princess is “doing well, all things considered.\" She's even left the house multiple times over the last two weeks. The insider adds that during the excursion — they didn't specify where she went, however, she was photographed in the car with William earlier this week — she was “smiling, upbeat, and enjoying being out.”\n“[This situation] has caused some stress for the princess, but she tends not to pay attention to online chatter or even the press,\" the source added. \"I think people forget that this was simply a mother wanting her family to look their best in a photograph that was going to be heavily scrutinized. She was protecting her children.”\nThe palace staff is reportedly slightly confused on how it got to this point, however, all in all, they're not losing sleep over it. Plus, they're ignoring the “ridiculous conspiracy theories.\" After all, they always told the public that Middleton would be on hiatus until Easter, and the source said \"nothing has changed on that front.” Over at Kensington Palace, things have been “tense, but there is a sense that this will pass. They aren’t too worried.”\n“Some staff can’t quite believe how badly KP have cocked things up by not paying close enough attention to what was being released to the world,\" the insider said. \"Didn’t anyone there think to check the photo before it went out?”\nSimilarly, William is also keeping calm and carrying on with his duties, seemingly having fun in the process. On Thursday, the prince opened a new youth zone called WEST — through his and Middleton's organization OnSide — in Hammersmith, West London, where he talked and laughed with the kids, as well as played basketball.\nGetty Images\nKate Middleton and Prince William Were Spotted Together for the First Time Since Her Surgery According to People , William is expected to attend an event with Diana Award on Thursday, where young men and women will receive recognition in honor of his late mother Princess Diana. William's estranged brother Prince Harry will also make an appearance virtually .",

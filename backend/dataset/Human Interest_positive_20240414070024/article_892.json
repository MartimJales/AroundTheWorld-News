    "text": "Liverpool fullback Conor Bradley was happy for his fellow youngsters after their 6-1 hammering of Sparta Prague.\nIt meant the Reds reach the Europa League quarterfinals 11-2 on aggregate.\nBradley said: \"I'd say it makes it an easier transition coming into the first team having so many of our young players, Harvey, Jarrell, Bobby, James McConnell . It definitely does help ease you into the team. I've been playing with them the whole way through the academy so to be playing with them now at Anfield is class, it is special.\n:\"I see them every day and know how good they are so just tell them to be themselves. I tell them to play their own game and if they make a mistake, get on the ball again and try to make things happen.\nOn his own development in recent months, he added: \"Yeah I do. Sometimes I am asked to do different things, tonight I was asked to come more inside and play in a double pivot. I just enjoy learning and gaining the experience. I just want to keep making myself better and hope it continues.\" Video of the day:\nAbout ",

    "text": "By Kevin Borba ,\n1 hour ago\nWhen it comes to Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter, he is quite literally the most versatile player in college football.\nHis Paul Hornung Award trophy that he received for dominating this past season on both offense and defense proves just that. While he was viewed as a corner by just about every college coach that recruited him, Deion Sanders always viewed him as a two-way star and is using him as such as he looks to rebuild the Colorado program.\nHowever, while one former two-way star like Sanders thinks Hunter is great at both and should continue to play both, fellow former two-way star Charles Woodson who excelled at Michigan in every way imaginable thinks Hunter should stick to receiver. Not because he isn't a good corner, but because he is just so dominant as a receiver. Woodson also touched on the fact that Hunter is a true two-way player, while he himself had a smaller role than most realize.\n\"He truly plays both ways,\" Woodson explained to Will Compton and Taylor Lewan on Bussin' With The Boys. \"Like a 130 plus plays a game...like I tell people like I dibbled and dabbled on offense and I didn't play a whole lot of offense. It just seems like it.\"\nWoodson finished his college career with 21 catches for 370 yards and three scores, while also rushing two as well. When asked where Hunter's best at, Woods went with his biggest enemy in the NFL, receiver.\n\"I think receiver, I think he's nasty at receiver. I mean he's a good corner don't get me wrong, but I see his offensive skills man...I think his offensive skills dominate over his defensive skills.\"\nRelated: Deion Sanders says Travis Hunter will cause a major problem when he gets to the NFL\nThis past season, Hunter racked up 57 catches for 721 yards and five scores on offense, while totaling 31 tackles, five pass breakups, and nabbing three picks. Based on recent comments from his head coach that urged NFL teams to let Hunter play both ways at the next level, it is safe to assume he will continue to be featured heavily on both sides.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

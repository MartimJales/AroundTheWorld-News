    "text": "Tolkien fans: YOU! SHALL! NOT! PASS up this opportunity to see some of the biggest blockbusters of our time on the big screen, in their biggest form, as Marcus Theatres will host a marathon of Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning \"Lord of the Rings\" movies this month.\nIn honor of Middle-Earth Day on Monday, March 25, several Marcus Theatres locations – including the Majestic, North Shore, Ridge and South Shore in the Milwaukee area – will show all three \"Lord of the Rings\" movies back to back to back on the big screen, starting at noon. And to really make this marathon as epic as possible, the theaters aren't just showing the regular theatrical editions of the \"Lord of the Rings\" films; you're getting Frodo and company's entire journey with all three extended editions, adding up to almost 12 hours of cinematic awesomeness. (Don't worry: A day may come when the courage of your bladder fails ... but it is not this day, because there will be an intermission between each film.)\nBest of all, tickets for this Tolkien-loving triple feature – hosted on both Monday, March 25 as well as Sunday, March 24, in case your boss won't let you take a one-day vacay to Middle-Earth – will only cost you $12.\nDon't let this precious opportunity to see these epics back on the big screen slip through your fingers: Tickets and passports to the full extended \"Lord of the Rings\" movie marathons are on sale now at\nMarcus Theatres' website. And if the one-day marathons are just a little too epic for you to handle, like Samwise Gamgee, Marcus Theatres isn't leaving you behind, as most Milwaukee-area Marcus locations will also show each of the three extended editions individually throughout the next week. Here's when each film will return to Brew City big screens:\n\"The Fellowship of the Ring\"\n- Friday, March 15\n- Monday, March 18\n- Thursday, March 21\n\"The Two Towers\"\n- Saturday, March 16\n- Tuesday, March 19\n- Friday, March 22\n\"The Return of the King\"\n- Sunday, March 17\n- Wednesday, March 20\n- Saturday, March 23\nFor more information on showtimes and tickets whether for the marathons or the individual screenings, visit\nMarcus Theatres' website. And for more info on what's all showing at Milwaukee movie theaters, check out OnMilwaukee's weekly listings.\nAs much as it is a gigantic cliché to say that one has always had a passion for film, Matt Mueller has always had a passion for film. Whether it was bringing in the latest movie reviews for his first grade show-and-tell or writing film reviews for the St. Norbert College Times as a high school student, Matt is way too obsessed with movies for his own good.\nWhen he's not writing about the latest blockbuster or talking much too glowingly about \"Piranha 3D,\" Matt can probably be found watching literally any sport (minus cricket) or working at - get this - a local movie theater. Or watching a movie. Yeah, he's probably watching a movie.\nGet all the daily headlines in your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter",

    "text": "SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Thursday, thousands of dollars were awarded to eight local non-profits for all of their work with helping the youth in Siouxland. Every year, Women United, pool together money and put it all toward helping local non-profits who have a focus of supporting children in the community. This year, they were able to give out $92,450, marking it their second-largest year to date. This year they were able to award grants to: Sleep in Heavenly Peace - $25,000 The Warming Shelter - $7,200 Mary J. Treglia Community House Preschool - $4,998 Big Brothers Big Sisters - $18,000 Girls Scouts of Greater Iowa - $6,950 Heartland Counseling - $25,550 Haven House Family Services Center - $2,256 Siouxland Mental Health Center - $2,496 “These agencies have come together, they have done so much for Siouxland Children. They are also doing so much for the community because they are investing their time and effort and their expertise in improving the community. It’s a great feeling,” said Cathy Perley, Chair of Women United. One of those non-profits, Sleep in Heavenly Peace, was awarded $25,000. With that money, they will be able to buy supplies for building the beds and maintaining their warehouse. “It’s a game changer, really, because the consistent support lasts throughout the year right, the consistent support we get through this will just mean a lot to the organization, our volunteers, the kids who are getting the beds, the families who are getting the beds,” said Elise Morris, a Core Team Member of Sleep in Heavenly Peace. With Thursday’s donation, the Women United has awarded over $1.3 million since 2006. Copyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",

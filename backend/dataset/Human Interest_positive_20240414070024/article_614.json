    "text": "A Story County boy is spending his spring break helping others by collecting stuffed animals for first responders. Tucker Hobbs was inspired to organize the drive after his little brother had to go to the hospital after a fall in November. What was a very scary situation was calmed when the ambulance crew gave Tucker's little brother a stuffed moose for comfort.Seeing how the stuffed moose — and later a stuffed cow gifted by hospital staff — made his brother feel better, Tucker decided he wanted to make sure other kids could be comforted during ambulance rides and hospital stays too.Tucker's Operation Emergency Cuddles stuffed animal drive will wrap up on Friday. He had a goal of collecting 50 stuffed animals, but so far, he's gotten 127.\"I just wanted to help those kids kinda relax them in a stressful situation because I know how those situations feel, can be very overwhelming, and just one stuffed animal can make their day a whole lot better,\" Tucker said.Right now, the stuffed animals will be going to the pediatrics unit at Mary Greeley in Ames and the Mary Greeley Medical Center emergency services, but Tucker hopes he can get enough to spread the love to other towns. If you'd like to help, there are drop boxes at the Story County 4H Extension Office or at Key Cooperative in Story City. The stuffed animals should be small to medium-sized and new with tags on. They can also be a stuffed animal with a blanket attached.Interested donors can also contact Tucker's mom, Ashley Hobbs, at ashley_hobbs11@yahoo.com.» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google PlayGet the latest headlines from KCCI",

    "text": "SRQ Airport expecting ‘record-breaking’ spring break SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Whether it’s frequent visitors or first timers, the Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport is filled with travelers soaking in the Suncoast. “We wanted to come to a Spring Training baseball game so we went and saw the Orioles a couple days ago,” says Jason Neises. The Neises family makes up four of the hundreds of thousands of people flying in and out of SRQ during spring break. “Every spring break we are having now is a record-breaking spring break. This year we expect it to be between 8 to 10% above last year,” says the airport’s executive vice president Mark Stuckey. This comes on the heels of five years of exponential growth. The airport served 3 million more passengers in 2023 than in 2018. “We’re working hard to make sure we have enough space and availability for these flights,” Stuckey says. They are currently in the middle of building a new 5-gate terminal where Allegiant Airlines will operate out of. And they are bringing in new options for travelers to enjoy while waiting for their flights. “We’re going to see some local restaurants that people are used to seeing that will come in here and be operating and bring that local flair in,” Stuckey says. Restaurants like Mattison’s, Patricks 1481, and Motorworks Brewing Company. The first day of service for the new gate is expected to be on Jan. 15 of next year. Copyright 2024 WWSB.

    "text": "Raleigh voters will see a familiar name on their ballots this fall. [Terrance (Truth) Ruth](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/terrence-ruth-interview/), 41, a professor in NC State University’s School of Social Work and community activist, will run for mayor once again after narrowly losing to Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin in the race for the office in 2022. “We will be prepared to face the challenges of tomorrow by inspiring Raleigh to make different choices today,” Ruth said in a press release announcing his candidacy dated March 14. “Our biggest challenges require long-term solutions. Long-term solutions are generated only when a city, not a small segment of a city, is invested in the process and the outcomes.” Ruth’s candidacy will focus on three principles: security, representation, and change, the press release continued. “Emphasizing the need for authentic leadership and innovative solutions, Dr. Ruth is committed to challenging the status quo and championing policies, prioritizing all Raleigh residents’ well-being,” the release stated. Ruth holds a Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the University of Central Florida and has worked as a teacher and principal in Wake County and as a nonprofit leader. Ruth is “deeply involved in local, state, and national social justice initiatives” and “leads coalitions to address local challenges through impact investing and creative collaborations, including projects to enhance affordable housing and innovate philanthropy,” according to the release. Ruth, who has not held elected office before, joins an already-crowded race for mayor. Raleigh city council member Corey Branch announced his candidacy this winter, as did former Raleigh council member, state senator, and NC treasurer [Janet Cowell](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/opportunities-and-wealth-for-some-and-displacement-and-burden-for-others-a-qa-with-raleigh-mayoral-candidate-janet-cowell/). Activist Delmonte Crawford, Republican mortgage broker Paul Fitts, and Peace University student James Shaughnessy IV have also announced their bids for the office. Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin has not formally announced whether she will run for reelection but has said that she expects to. In 2022, Ruth received 41 percent of the vote to Baldwin’s 47 percent. Community advocate DaQuanta Copeland placed third with 10 percent of the vote. The candidate filing period opens July 5 and Election Day is November 5. All eight city council seats will be on the ballot. Follow Editor-in-Chief Jane Porter on [jporter@indyweek.com](mailto:jporter@indyweek.com).",

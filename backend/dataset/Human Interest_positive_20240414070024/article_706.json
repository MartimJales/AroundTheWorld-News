    "text": "American Red Cross ‘Sound the Alarm’ campaign aims to save lives in Webb County WEBB COUNTY, TX (KGNS) - The American Red Cross is doing its best to make sure Webb Couty residents are safe from any potential house fires. As part of the “Sound the Alarm” campaign, the Red Cross will be installing free smoke detectors for county residents who live in all areas of Webb County. Every year, officials and volunteers with the Red Cross go to different houses to replace old or broken smoke detectors with new devices. Judith Mena, the disaster program manager for the Red Cross said that with each smoke detector that they install, the hope is to potentially save lives. “We can install from four and on, so and everything is completely free, so there is no charge for anything, and you are also provided with a small education class for other incidents like a flood and things like that.” If you would like to request a free smoke alarm, Mena asks that you call 210-582-1962. The organization plans to start installing smoke detectors on March 23. For more headlines. click [here](https://www.kgns.tv/news/local). Copyright 2024 KGNS. All rights reserved.",

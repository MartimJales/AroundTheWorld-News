    "text": "<p>Scottish comedian Daniel Sloss, known for his dark humour, arrives in India today for his eight-city tour. The Bengaluru leg of the ‘Daniel Sloss: Can’t’ tour will be held on Sunday.</p>.<p>In an email interview with Metrolife, he talks about the comedy scene in India, and cancel culture, which is the theme of his latest show.</p>.<p><strong>Have you performed in India before?</strong></p>.<p>I’ve been to India once before. In March of last year, I visited Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi. I think the (audience) understanding of English in India is better than a lot of European countries, in terms of live comedy.</p>.<p>India has had a comedy scene for well over 25 years so I find the audiences to be comedy-literate. But they are also more sensitive to certain topics than others.</p>.<p><strong>Tell us about the ‘Can’t’ tour.</strong></p>.<p>‘Can’t’, which is part of ‘The Loop’, a new DeadAnt Live intellectual property, is about (exploring) standup comedy in the face of cancel culture — whether cancel culture exists, to what degree, and where it exists in different parts of the world. The show will also include a lot of jokes about fatherhood because I’m a dad now and I have nothing else to talk about.</p>.<p><strong>You make jokes on topics like sex education. What’s your comedy material about this time?</strong></p>.<p>I’m talking about childbirth, pregnancy, a man’s role in childbirth and pregnancy, the first few months of parenthood, and the freedom of speech.</p>.<p><strong>How do you prepare for your shows?</strong></p>.<p>I don’t. You can take me (out) for food, you can put me in a go-kart, you can get me drunk — (I do) no preparation whatsoever. (Similarly), tell me when to go on stage and I’ll go on stage.</p>.<p><strong>Does every city you perform in influence your content?</strong></p>.<p>Sometimes. I like doing a bit of local material at the top because one thing I find true about the world is that audiences like having a mirror held to them. That’s what comedy is. It’s just a comedian showing you what you look like to him.</p>.<p>Romantic relationships are not for everyone. That was the theme of your OTT special ‘Jigsaw’. It reportedly led to over 2,00,000 breakups and several divorces. </p><p><strong>What inspires your content?</strong></p>.<p>Passion. If I love something or hate something then I find it easy to talk about it. I rarely exist in the middle. I either love things fully or I hate them to death. And the juxtaposition of that on stage is what people enjoy.</p>.<p><strong>Who are your favourite comics?</strong> </p>.<p>I like comedians like Jimmy Carr, Ryan Cullen, and Anthony Jeselnik. I like dark comedy and comedy that pushes the boundaries. I think that’s the purpose of art.</p>.<p>‘Daniel Sloss: Can’t — India Tour 2024’, March 17, 2.30 pm and 7 pm, at St John’s College Auditorium, Koramangala. Tickets online. </p>",

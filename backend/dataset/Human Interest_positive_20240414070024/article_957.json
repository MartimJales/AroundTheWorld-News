    "text": "Adults will stumble through the woods on an Easter egg hunt next weekend. Why? For the Boy Scouts.\nThe Boy Scouts of America Sagamore Council will host the “Scouting 4 Eggs Adult Easter Egg Hunt presented by Caterpillar” at the Franklin L. Cary Camp at 6 p.m. March 23.\nIt will be the largest adult-only Easter egg hunt in the state, according to a press release from the Boy Scouts of America Sagamore Council.\n“Over 50,000 eggs and 2,000 prizes to be given out; 70” LG TV, digital camera, VR, sports tickets/memorabilia, artwork, gift cards, and more amazing prizes from more than 100 local businesses,” the press release said.\nThough the event is adult-oriented and entry is for those 18 and up, no alcohol will be served on the grounds because it is a Boy Scout camp, according to the press release.\n“The whole idea behind it is to have it be something that's more based around adult fun,” said Zachary Danek, a junior in the Polytechnic Institute and the College of Liberal Arts. “Even though (you’re) not supposed to drink there, it is common for adults to drink a bit before showing up. A lot of parents will get a babysitter for the night and it'll be a nice date evening.”\nTickets are being sold in advance with preregistration for $25 at\nhttp://scouting4eggs.com.\nShuttles from Faith Church East will begin running at 6 p.m., according to the website. There will be no parking at Cary Camp. Hunting will begin at sunset.\n\"Please do not arrive just before sunset in case the sunset allows us to start a few minutes early,\" the website notes.\nShuttles will begin returning hunters to their vehicles about 30 minutes after the start of the hunting.\nIncluded will be live music, a photo booth, Easter-inspired costume contest, Easter Bunny and yard games.\nGlow sticks will be on sale, and free s'mores will be available. The campfire rings will be back so bring a lawn chair if you want to sit around a fire.\nTake a flashlight and closed-toed shoes.",

    "text": "From Laughter to Learning: Iris Barratt's Mission to Transform Event Entertainment into Educational Opportunities for Single Parents\nOakridge, Oregon - Iris Barratt of Oakridge, Oregon is on a mission to empower single parents across the nation with her lucrative home-based business scholarships. In the US, there are currently 9.9 million single mothers and 21.2 million children living in single-parent families.\nAs an avid lifelong learner, Iris’ passion is creating and teaching programs that provide practical public benefits.

Getting all dressed up and honoring people with meaningful, keepsake awards and applause creates genuine unity within the community and builds a strong sense of group connection. Giving away my programs (with several variations), will allow me to fulfil my vision/mission/legacy of collaborating and sharing my lucrative home-based business opportunity for event entertainers and watching families benefit nationwide,” says Iris Barratt\nIris plans to give away her appreciation event programs to find endorsements and sponsorships that will pay for student expenses and bring nationwide promotion.\nOnline colleges provide parents with the benefits of flexibility, affordability, improved skill sets, and improved school-life balance. It allows students to maintain their jobs, care for children, or simply prioritize self-care. Many single parents today seriously require this. They have jobs, families, and other commitments that prevent them from going to school in person. Parents need a program they can access anywhere, at any time.\nFamily events serve ages 8 and up, focusing on the thrill of honoring others and being honored with meaningful, poetic Nobility Awards. These awards of honor (22) include Awards like Childlike Wonder, Lovable Laughter, Valuable Volunteer, Free Spirit, Honorary Caregiver, Loving Kindness, Gifted and Talented Child, Spirit of Compassion, Humanitarian Hero, Lifelong Learning, Illustrious Instigator and Humanitarian Healing.\n“Being honored and genuinely honoring others deepens our sense of belonging and builds self-esteem too. Laughing together and at ourselves is priceless!” Everyone walks the red carpet to uplifting music, receives their Nobility Award of Honor, and gives a short gratitude speech with thrilling applause!” She added.\nIris’ sassy clean comedy version, offers funny Wake-up Call Awards like Narcissistic Numb-skull, Beneficial Bullshitter, Mindless Moocher, Passionate Pack Rat, Gossip Monger, Conscientious Couch Potato, and Morbid Martyrdom.

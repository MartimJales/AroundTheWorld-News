Maura and I have always had a fantastic work relationship together, and a personal relationship as well.’\n‘We always got on really well and we’d always shoot the breeze, we’d always bounce things off each other, and we know that we’d have each other’s back as well, which is important when you’re working with somebody like that all the time as well.’\n‘And we’ve got to this stage where we don’t take each other too seriously and we can bounce off each other, we can say things to each other that you might not necessarily say to other people, which is always a good place to be.’\nThe pair host the Today Show on RTÉ together, having boasted a working relationship that spans a large portion of both their careers. Dáithí is fond of a ‘work wife’, admitting his recent Rose Of Tralee partnership with Kathryn Thomas added another to his collection.\nSpeaking about his new co-host, he revealed: ‘Yeah, I suppose it was strange. First of all, I thought there was something wrong. So I asked the bosses, I said ‘okay, have I done something wrong here?” And they said “No, not at all. The figures are very strong”, which is one of the things they’ll always look at.’\n‘So it was just about adding to what we had I think, that was their thinking about it. So they said “what do you think of that?” and I said “well, I just need to think about this, you’re kind of landing this on me”.’\n‘So went off and thought about it, and then they said we’re looking at Kathryn Thomas, and I said “I know Kathryn Thomas for over 20 years, she’s a good friend of mine.” And so then we decided okay we’re going to make this work, and we made it work.’",

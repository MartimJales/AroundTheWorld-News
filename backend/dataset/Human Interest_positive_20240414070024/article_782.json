THE NATE CROWLEY STORY IS ALL ABOUT WORK AND GROWTH. I TRY AND PLAY AS SMART AS I CAN AND PRETTY DEFENSIVELY. TRY TO GO TO THE NET AS MUCH AS I CAN AND HOPEFULLY TAP HOME SOME GOALS. THE WORK THAT THE WINDHAM SENIOR HOCKEY STAR HAS PUT IN SHOWS IN THE RECORD BOOKS. HE HIT HIS 100TH POINT THIS YEAR. HE HAD EIGHT POINTS GOING INTO JUNIOR YEAR, SO HE’S DEFINITELY TAKING HIS GAME UP A NOTCH AND IT’S GREAT TO SEE THAT BE REWARDED AND RECOGNIZED. OH, IT WAS GREAT. UM, I ACTUALLY DIDN’T KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED AT THE TIME. UH, BUT YEAH, I HAD A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS, FRIENDS HERE, SO IT WAS GREAT TO SHARE THAT MOMENT WITH THEM. CROWLEY’S IMPROVEMENT MIRRORS THE ENTIRE JAGUARS PROGRAM, WHICH FINISHED THE SEASON AS ONE OF THE TOP TWO TEAMS IN DIVISION ONE. IT’S BEEN GREAT TO SEE THESE KIDS, UH, YOU KNOW, REALIZE THE DREAM. YOU KNOW, THEY WENT FROM FROM WINLESS FRESHMAN TO, YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE THE PLAYOFFS. SOPHOMORES. CROWLEY’S MENTALITY CAME THROUGH ON THE GOLF COURSE HELPING WINDHAM WIN A STATE TITLE. WE HAD AN UNDEFEATED SEASON THIS YEAR AND A COUPLE OF MY TEAMMATES FOR THE HOCKEY TEAM WERE ON THE TEAM, SO IT WAS GREAT TO SHARE THAT WITH THEM. CROWLEY WILL CONTINUE HIS ATHLETIC CAREER AT MERRIMACK, WHERE HE’LL PLAY GOLF. NOT THE MOST OUTSPOKEN, BUT ALWAYS DOES THINGS THE RIGHT WAY. ALWAYS GIVES 100%. I TRY MY BEST THOUGH, HERE, UH, EVERY DAY AND I FEEL LIKE WE’VE ALL DONE OUR BEST THIS YEAR.

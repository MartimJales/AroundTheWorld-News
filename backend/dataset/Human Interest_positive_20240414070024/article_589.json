    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - Veterans in South Georgia are being recognized for their service to this country, with tables built in their memory. One family who lost their son to a life of service can now continue his legacy by raising support for the organization Tables for Heroes.\nSpecialist Charles Odum II’s family experienced this firsthand with a table being donated to them in his memory.\n“A worthy cause. The man was 22 years old when he was killed in Iraq, so it was a fantastic sponsorship to honor him,” Sheron Kendrick, owner of Rebuild, Restore, Rebirth Tables for Heroes said.\nTables for Heroes ensures that family members of loved ones who lose their lives have a way to always remember them. That’s why this table was dedicated to Specialist Charles’ family-- to help keep his memory alive.\n“He was responsible for the saving of three lives, he was driving an hombre and his hombre was hit by an IED,” Charles Odum Sr. said.\nSpecialist Charles Odum II was an Army Medic who lost his life in 2004. Now, 20 years later, his family says this loss was one of the hardest things they’ve had to overcome.\n“Charles didn’t make it, it was just disheartening, it was the hardest news I’ve ever heard in my life,” said Janel Johnson, Charles’ sister.\nThe family is grateful for the sponsor that allowed Kendrick to build this table, and they are encouraging other people in the community to continue to sponsor these tables as they remember the lives of the people who fought for this country.\n“He found a sponsor that Mr. David Shorter was sponsoring the table for us, and he thought it would be a great gift, a great memory, in honor of my brother,” Johnson said.\n“We just wanted to let everybody know that his service and his sacrifice has not gone unrecognized,” Kendrick said.\nSpecialist Charles Odum II family says this sponsored table will create new memories for their family as they remember their loved one. (SOURCE: WALB) The family says that Specialist Charles Odum II died doing something that he loved - saving people because that was the type of person that he was.\n“This is very well deserved. I’m a veteran myself, and once you leave your country and you go fight for your country, it’s very much appreciated for somebody to think about the veteran, especially the ones that passed away and the ones that are still here,” said Lynn Johnson, Odum’s brother-in-law. “A lot of veterans don’t get the recognition that they truly deserve, and this is truly a fantastic way to honor them and to memorialize their service and their sacrifice.”\nOdum’s family says Memorial Day is a difficult holiday for their family. His father says he can remember coming home from the store to see a chaplain in his home delivering the somber news of his son being killed in Iraq in 2004.\n“They told me what happened, that Charles was hit with an IED and credited it to saving three lives,” Janel said.\n“When I walked in, I saw the officer and the chaplain there with my wife. So Memorial Day will be a day that I will always remember and hold dear in my heart,” Odum said.\nDespite the memories that the holiday brings, the Odom Family says, this table donation will add a new memory moving forward.\n“That’s the kind of heart he had, everybody he met, he loved, he remembered them. He didn’t treat you any different from family,” Janel said.\n“We’re going to have a Thanksgiving feast and that’s going to remind me of that- that’ll remind me of him, sitting at this table,” Odum Sr. said.\nThe proceeds that are raised from these tables go towards building a ramp for disabled veterans in the community. To sponsor a table, you can contact Kendrick at (229) 854-3415.\nTo ",

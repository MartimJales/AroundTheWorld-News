    "text": "February 25, 1937 - March 4, 2024\nIn loving memory ~\nJim is survived by his devoted wife, Joyce Bradley. He has three daughters in Creston, BC: Debby Johnson (spouse is Lee), Cathy Fiedler (spouse is Les), and Sandy Kunze (spouse is Dirk). Jim has seven grandchildren: Gary Johnson, Samantha Johnson, Lacey Fiedler, Joshua Kunze, Justin Kunze, Brayden Kunze, and Brody Kunze. Jim was predeceased by his ex-wife, Ina Hall, and his parents, Richard and Ada Hall.\nFrom an early age, Jim was interested in becoming a pilot. His dream was fulfilled at age 17 when he received his private pilot's license through the Royal Canadian Air Cadet Flying Scholarship Plan. Jim went on to attain a commercial pilot's license, and his first flying job was winter bush flying in the Canadian north.\nJim then trained as an Air Traffic Controller. During his 27-year ATC career, he continued part-time flying as an instructor and charter pilot. After retiring from ATC, he started an aerial photography company in Calgary, where he flew and shot low-level \"Scenic-Oblique\" aerial photos. Jim had an official Calgary 1988 Olympic Winter Games poster named \"Aerial Venue\" and volunteered at the Olympics.\nAfter 14 years, he retired from aerial photography and returned to casual charter flying. From his aviation experiences, he wrote a nonfiction book, \"Tower Tales,\" a historical view of mid-century aviation. Jim signed over the copyright to his aerial photo negatives, slide film, and book to the University of Calgary, where these are available to the public in digital format.\nAt the age of 70, Jim had spent 50 years flying. He let his Canadian and American commercial pilot and glider pilot licenses expire and stepped into full retirement in south-central BC.\nAmong his many hobbies in retirement, Jim played the bagpipes with the Shuswap Pipes and Drums Pipe Band in Salmon Arm, BC, and enjoyed performing in events throughout the area. With his Drone Pilot's license, Jim continued his photography as a hobby. Jim's upbeat attitude, engaging, friendly personality, and passion for life will be missed by his community and loved ones.\nThe family wishes to sincerely thank the wonderful nurses, doctors, and staff members who provided Jim's care. In keeping with Jim's simple wishes, the family will be holding a private celebration of Jim's life at a later date.\nShare condolences and memories of Jim through his obituary at www.fischersfuneralservices.com",

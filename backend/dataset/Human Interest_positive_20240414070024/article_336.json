    "text": "COLCHESTER, Conn. — The corned beef and cabbage is already being cooked at the Inishmor Pub in [Colchester](https://www.fox61.com/section/new-london-county). Now nearly a decade old, the Irish pub is looking forward to a Saint Patrick’s Day that falls on a Sunday in 2024 - and that will only help business. Owner and head chef Alex Levere said, “it’s super Sunday,” and added, “that’s the one day everyone wants to be in an Irish Pub – from 8 a.m. to probably 9 p.m. it’s full.” Levere, who trained as a chef in Ireland, said that corned beef and cabbage is king all week in Colchester, “this week (we will prepare) somewhere between 1,500 and 16,000 pounds, and for the month just over a ton.” Andrew Kyser, the bar manager at the Inishmor, said that Saint Patrick’s Day at the pub is, “the best chaos because it’s everyone you know – it’s friends and family that come in.” Having navigated the pitfalls of the pandemic, Levere said that this year feels different. “I would say last year was about recovery and coming out of COVID, it still didn’t feel as authentic as it should – this year is about celebrating. It’s about making memories and it’s about relationships,\" he said. After preparing a signature Shepards Pie, which is a crowd favorite, Levere added that Saint Patrick’s Day at the Inishmor “is the culmination of a year's worth of work.” To learn more about the Inishmor Pub in Colchester click [https://theinishmorpub.com/](https://theinishmorpub.com/).

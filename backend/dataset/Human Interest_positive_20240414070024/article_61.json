    "text": "‘Nate means a lot to us’ | Cocke County community rallies behind autistic man, hoping to get him a home After spending months in a motel, Cocke County’s Nate Morriss is starting to get the help he needs. NEWPORT, Tenn. (WVLT) - If you live in Newport, you’ve probably heard of Nate Morriss. He’s a 24-year-old autistic man who’s made an effort to be a part of his community his whole life, but he’s been living out of a motel since January. Now, the Cocke County community is banding together to get him the help he needs. When Morriss spoke with WVLT News, he seemed optimistic about the situation and ready to face it head on. “We’re trying to find the house for me and my mother here,” Morriss said. “And we’re going to get this. We’re going to do this, and we’re going to get it done.” He’s got good reason to believe things will work out; people in Cocke County are rallying behind him, thanks in part to Wade Wester, Morriss’ driver’s education teacher and friend. He’s been paying for the room and is the one who organized a fundraiser to get Morriss the help he needs. “This is a temporary fix. He’s living in a motel and we don’t like that. I know he doesn’t like that,” Wester said. Morriss’ friends said you’ll always see him with a smile on his face, whether he’s at work or cheering for his Cocke County High School Fighting Cocks at a basketball game. The community raised more than $6,500 for Morriss, something his old old principal, Dr. AC Willis, said he’s happy to see. “Nate means a lot to us, and we want to see Nate succeed,” Willis said. “We want to see Nate have the scaffolding that is needed for him to succeed.” Morriss is also helping himself— working at Food City twice a week to save up money of his own. He told WVLT News he’s grateful to have a roof over his head, but wants a place to himself. “It would be fantastic to have,” Morriss said. “So that I could be with my mother and just have a good life with my mother.” That home is a goal the community is happy to help with, Wester said. “When this GoFundMe came out, just everybody that had been around Nate at some point just started putting money in the account,” Wester said. “Because of the impression that he made on them.” Those people, donating to see Morriss and his mother in a home, made an impression on the young man. “All my friends here who are praying for me right now, I just want to say ‘thanks everybody,’” Morriss said.

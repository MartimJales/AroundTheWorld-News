    "text": "By Katie Parkins ,\n6 hours ago While it's a snow day for many of Colorado's humans, both young and old, their furry friends are also enjoying the storm.\nMaybe as much as the children, \"This little Pomsky is loving the snowday!\" Gemma Hanekom said.\nRebecca Seib and her pup went for a walk Thursday morning in Lakewood's Union Ridge Park.\n\"Crazy snow amounts! Over 18+ inches!\" Seib said in her post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook group, noting she brought a tape measure with them on their stroll.\n\"The crazy thing is my dogs paws couldn't even reach the sidewalk!\" Seib said in her post.\nBut this pup didn't seem to mind, shoving its snoot straight into the snow.\nImpressive snow totals popping up in Florissant, Colorado in Teller County, just barely missing 2 feet when Claudia Ädams posted this photo of her trudging through the snow up to its belly.\nIn Castle Rock on Ridge Road, Michelle Rhea Karamooz sent us this video of letting her dogs outside.\nThe duo was just having so much fun, Karamooz asked Lily to lead her brother Luke back indoors. The pup came trotting in with a fresh layer of snow stuck to his back, seemingly without a care in the world.\nMichelle Rhea Karamooz.mp4 Looking at the table in her yard, Karamooz said she estimated there was about 16 inches of accumulation.\nIn Genesee Park, Erik Lassi snapped this photo of his pup waiting patiently to come back inside. Despite the inches of snow stacked up in the yard, this dog managed to only get a sprinkling on its back.\nErik Lassi Laura C. Keuhl told us she's seeing around 2 feet of snow in North Evergreen, which was just about as tall as their Australia Shepherd wading through the backyard. The pup got back to the door with a flare, bouncing through the approximately 24 inches.\nAustralia Shepherd in North Evergreen wades into snow Denver7's Angelika Albaladejo took this video of her dog Maya playing with her ball in the snow in Lakewood.\nDenver7's Angelika Albaladejo plays with her dog in the snow Dave Bader shared this video with Denver7 on Instagram of his pup traipsing through the snow in Highlands Ranch. You could almost lose his dog in the snow, especially as it dives headfirst into a pile.\nDAVE BADER.mp4 In south Castle Rock, Kathy McQueary's dog has a special talent sitting on top of all that snow without sinking.\nKathy McQueary While Carolina's dog was nearly up to its chest in the snow in Castle Rock.\nCarolina Meet Boon from Longmont. Allison Sendziak said Boon was enjoying the fresh snow Thursday, even though it may not look like it.\nAllison Sendzia No matter the size, the pups were out and about Thursday. This 13-week old-puppy Maggi got to experience 18 inches of snow and counting in Highlands Ranch.\nJennifer Mravich Maggi's in good company.\nSnuffkin, Daisy Geasland's 11-month-old Springer Spaniel, wanted to help shovel the driveway with her paw-rents in southeast Aurora.\n\"The snow is one Snufkin deep,\" Geasland said.\nWhile this pup's name may be Autumn, she's looking like she's made for winter. Karoline told Denver7, Autumn was loving playing in the snow in their West Highlands backyard.\nKaroline You'd think it was summer though with the way Madison Mcfarland Elwell's Collie was laying out in the snow.\n\"She is loving this weather\" in Old Town Lafayette, Colorado, Elwell said\n\"Where's Waldo?\" If you look really closely, you'll be able to spot Josie Rhoads-Verbeek's dog sticking out from underneath 12 inches of snow in Arvada.\nJosie Rhoads-Verbeek This fluff ball is \"Up to snow good\" in Centennial, Colorado, Karen Dyroff said in the Denver7 Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook group.\nColorado snow totals? \"Dachshund size!\" Lynn Lynn said in a post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook group.\nWho needs the Metric System when you can measure in pups per square foot?\nThere's \"one Corgi of snow in Golden, CO!\" Cecillia Sanders said.\n\"Where you lead, I will follow...,\" Jennifer Deherrera's dogs told her, leaving a trail of tiny paw prints through Thursday's snow.\nJennifer Deherra Colorado's dogs (and their owners) are getting creative in the snow \"riding the storm out in Boulder,\" Jocasta Captures said.\nIn Elizabeth, Colorado, \"Meadow and Juniper give this storm up!!!\" Patti Yoensky said in her post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook page.\nBut it's not just the dogs taking in Thursday's delivery from Jack Frost.\nWe've got some Colorado cats venturing out in the snow.\n\"My other cat doesn’t want to go out in the snow as much..smart! Love my kitty boys!\" Eadin Reid said in a post on Denver7's Discover Colorado Through Your Photos Facebook page.\nDENVER WEATHER LINKS: Hourly forecast | Radars | Traffic | Weather Page | 24/7 Weather Stream\nClick here to watch the Denver7 live weather stream.\nDenver7 live 24/7 weather stream\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Good Friday 2024: Quotes - “The cross is not the terrible end to an otherwise fearful and happy life, but it meets us at the beginning of our communion with Christ.” -Dietrich Bonhoeffer - “If Christ is God, He cannot sin, and if suffering was a sin in and by itself, He could not have suffered and died for us. However, since He took the most horrific death to redeem us, He showed us in fact that suffering and pain have great power.” -E.A. Bucchianeri, Brushstrokes of a Gadfly - “Good Friday is not about us trying to \"get right with God.\" It is about us entering the difference between God and humanity and just touching it for a moment. Touching the shimmering sadness of humanity's insistence that we can be our own gods, that we can be pure and all-powerful.” -Nadia Bolz-Weber, Accidental Saints: Finding God in All the Wrong People - “Easter is a time when God turned the inevitability of death into the invincibility of life.” -Craig D. Lounsbrough - “We focus on Good Friday and Resurrection Sunday, but we forget to pause in the stillness of the days between. Find time today to be present in that place of waiting. There is treasure to be found in the sacred peace that comes as you breathe in that place of quiet surrender. Don’t rush through the space called “Between.” -Katherine J Walden - “Good Friday was when the Good was crucified but then on Easter the Good arose back.... So wait to realize that be it God or be it human the good never perishes it's rises above.” -Amit Abraham - “May your Good Friday be blessed with the presents of Jesus on your lips, and his never ending grace in your heart. May his grace surround your family, and fill your lives with peace, health and happiness.” -Ron Baratono - \"What is good about Good Friday? Why isn't it called Bad Friday? Because out of the appallingly bad came what was inexpressibly good. And the good trumps the bad, because though the bad was temporary, the good is eternal.\" -Randy Alcorn - \"The cross is the victory, the resurrection is the triumph…The resurrection is the public display of the victory, the triumph of the crucified one.\" - Leon Morris - \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.\" - John 3:16-17 (Bible) Good Friday 2024: Images Source: Pinterest Source: Pinterest Source: Pinterest Source: LoveThisPic",

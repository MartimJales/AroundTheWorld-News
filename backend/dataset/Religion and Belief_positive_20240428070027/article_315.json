    "text": "LA Tenorio and his devotion to St. Padre Pio\nBasketball star LA Tenorio is a devotee of St. Padre Pio.\nSt. Padre Pio was an Italian monk who was known for his stigmata or the wounds which were similar to Jesus Christ's wounds in His crucifixion. Many claim that devotion to Padre Pio would lead to curing sicknesses.\nIn an episode of Biyahe ni Drew, the Barangay Ginebra star shared that he became a devotee of St. Padre Pio even before he was\ndiagnosed with colon cancer in 2022.\n\"Before I was diagnosed na may cancer, pumupunta na ako rito kay Padre Pio,\" Tenorio shared.\n\"Ang laking pagbabago ng perspective in life. Number one, it really strengthened my faith.\"\n(Before I was diagnosed with cancer, I already came to Padre Pio. I had a different perspective in life. Number one, it strengthened my faith.)\nHis parents influenced him to be a devotee and while undergoing treatment for his cancer, Tenorio had relics and religious articles with Padre Pio's image.\n\"Nung nagkasakit ako, karamihan ng mga kaibigan, kamag-anak, puro Padre Pio relic ang binibigay sa akin. Alam nila na nakakapagpagaling talaga si Padre Pio ng mga may sakit, lalo na ng malalang sakit.\"\n(When I was diagnosed, many of my friends and relatives gave me Padre Pio relics. They know that Padre Pio cures even extreme sickness.)\nEventually,\nTenorio became cancer-free and returned to basketball with a bigger purpose.\n\"We tend to take things for granted. 'Di natin nare-realize how important they are in our lives. Binigyan ako ng pagkakataon ulit ng ating Panginoon na higher purpose. It's higher than basketball already.\"\n(We tend to take things for granted. We do not realize how important they are in our lives. I was given a chance by God to have a higher purpose. It's higher than basketball already.)\nâ€”JKC, GMA Integrated News",

    "text": "Easter 2024: The day is commemorated through solemn rituals and heartfelt prayers. Easter is one of the most significant days on the Christian calendars and falls on the third day after Jesus' death on Good Friday. Easter marks a time of profound spiritual renewal and celebration. Rooted in both religious tradition and cultural festivity, Easter embodies the essence of hope, rebirth and joy. The day concludes the \"Passion of Christ\" series of holidays that start with Ash Wednesday. The Easter tradition is believed to be over 2,000 years old and one of the most important religious holidays for Christians. This year Easter is on March 31. At the heart of Easter lies the Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ three days after crucifixion, signifying victory over death and the promise of eternal life. His body was brought down from the cross and buried in a tomb. Three days after this, Jesus rose from the dead. He walked out of the tomb, appearing to one of his disciples Mary Magdalene. This sacred event is commemorated through solemn rituals, uplifting hymns and heartfelt prayers, uniting believers in gratitude and reverence. Easter traditions vary across cultures and regions, each adding a unique flavour to the festivities. From colourful egg hunts to elaborate feasts, families and communities come together to rejoice in the spirit of camaraderie and goodwill. Decorating eggs, exchanging gifts and indulging in sweet treats like chocolate bunnies are cherished customs that add to the merriment of the occasion. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The symbolism of eggs and bunnies in Easter festivities dates back centuries, with each carrying its own significance. Eggs, representing fertility and new life, are adorned in myriad hues, symbolising the diversity and beauty of creation. Meanwhile, the Easter Bunny, a beloved figure in folklore, brings joy and laughter as it hops from home to home, delivering baskets filled with treats and treasures. Easter gatherings are marked by an abundance of delectable dishes, ranging from succulent roasts to freshly baked pastries. Families gather around the table, sharing stories, laughter and blessings, as they savour the flavours of the season. Whether it's a traditional lamb roast or a sumptuous Easter brunch, the feast symbolises abundance, generosity and gratitude. Beyond the festivities and feasting, Easter is a time for introspection and gratitude. It offers an opportunity to reflect on life's blessings, seek forgiveness and extend compassion to others. Through acts of kindness and charity, individuals embody the spirit of Easter, spreading love and goodwill to all.",

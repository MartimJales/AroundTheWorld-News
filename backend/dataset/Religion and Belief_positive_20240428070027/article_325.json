    "text": "6 Bible Teachings For Good Friday By Jasreet Kaur 29, Mar 2024 08:00 AM jagranjosh.com Good Friday Good Friday is a special day for Christians, as it reminds us of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. It's a time to think about six important lessons from the Bible that help us understand the meaning of Good Friday better. Sacrifice Good Friday signifies Jesus's sacrifice on the cross for humanity's redemption, highlighting the biblical theme of atonement. Forgiveness Jesus's forgiveness for his executioners demonstrates the biblical principle of extending mercy and forgiveness, even in the face of injustice. Love The crucifixion event showcases God's love for humanity, portraying the ultimate act of love—laying down one's life for others. Humility Jesus's obedience to God's will, even unto death, exemplifies humility and submission to divine authority. Hope Good Friday leads to Easter Sunday, representing hope and renewal, reminding believers that even in darkness, there is the promise of new beginnings. Victory Over Death Despite Jesus's death, Good Friday anticipates triumph over death and offering believers the hope of eternal life. Chanakya’s Quotes To Guide Your Life Decisions Read More",

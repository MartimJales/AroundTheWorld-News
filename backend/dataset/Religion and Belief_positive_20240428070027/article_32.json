    "text": "> FRIENDSHIP — Although Easter is seen by many as just another holiday during which families can get together for a time of relaxation and connections, several Friendship churches are creating an expanded focus this year as to what they view as the true meaning of the holiday.\nThe What God is Doing in Friendship ny alliance of churches has placed yard signs throughout the community, proclaiming that “God Created Easter FOR YOU.”\nFollowers of the Way-Nile Community Church, at 4095 Route 275, which holds its weekend services on Saturdays, will conduct Resurrection Sabbath observances at 11 a.m. Saturday, followed by a free dinner for the community at 1 p.m.\nThe following morning, the public is invited to gather for Easter Sunday sunrise services at 7 a.m. at either the parking area at the intersection of County Roads 31 and 31-A, south of Friendship, or at the Bible Baptist Church. Both groups then will join together at the Baptist Church location for a free continental breakfast.\nEaster Sunday services will be held at regular times at Friendship churches, except for the United Church of Friendship at 31 E. Main St., which will meet at 9:30 a.m., rather than its normal 11 a.m. start.\nKirk Kirch, pastor of the independent United Church, an alliance participant, said the joint churches’ focus is designed to highlight Christian beliefs that “Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died, was buried and then was resurrected three days later as an atonement, or forgiveness, of sins for everyone who believes in Him. ... When a believer dies, he or she will receive eternal life in Heaven with other family members and friends who also have placed their faith in Jesus.”\nPastor Duane Broadwell of the Bible Baptist Church, said, “God created this salvation opportunity so that all may join Him forever, upon physical death, despite our sin and without continually offering animal blood sacrifices for such sins, as occurred in the Old Testament before the resurrection of Jesus.”\nPastor Kevin Palmiter of the Followers of the Way noted that although church denominations may have different practices and beliefs in some areas, the basic foundation of a Bible-believing church is the same in that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, whose coming to earth was prophesied in the Old Testament of the Bible and chronicled in its New Testament.\nIndividuals who want to learn more about the Christian faith and the understanding that “God Created Easter FOR YOU,” should contact the pastor at a local church, the church leaders note.",

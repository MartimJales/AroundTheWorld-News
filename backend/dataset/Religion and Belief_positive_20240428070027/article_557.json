    "text": "In his homily at the Manila Cathedral on the evening of Maundy Thursday, Advincula stressed the importance of the washing of the feet, not merely as a hygienic act but as a sign of one's relationship with Jesus. “Kaya naman, sa taong ito nang panalangin, ang mga kapatid natin na huhugasan ang paa, ay kumakatawan sa kahalagahan ng panalangin. Sa kanilang iba’t-iba at natatanging paraan, sila ay tumutulong, nagtuturo at naging gabay sa panalangin ng kanilang mga pinaglilingkuran,” Advincula said. (Therefore, in this year of prayer, our brothers and sisters who will wash their feet represent the importance of prayer. In their different and unique ways, they help, teach and guide in the prayer of those they serve.) Advincula also highlighted the significance of the Eucharist as the highest form of prayer, where Jesus offers himself and is offered. He also said that the Eucharist is a powerful prayer where the faithful thank God for all the blessings we receive and ask for strength to face life's challenges. “Sa gabing ito na itinatag ni Hesus ang pinaka mataas ng anyo ng panalangin ng simbahan, ang eukaristiya, makita nawa nating muli ang halaga ng panalangin sa ating buhay. Kung paanong, hindi mabubuhay ang isda, kung wala ito sa tubig, hindi rin tayo mabubuhay bilan Kristyano, kung hindi tayo magdadasal,” he said. (On this evening when Jesus instituted the highest form of prayer in the Church, the Eucharist, may we once again see the value of prayer in our lives. Just as a fish cannot live without water, we cannot live as Christians if we do not pray.) During Maundy Thursday, Catholics commemorate both the washing of the feet and the Last Supper which believed are the events before Jesus Christ was arrested leading to his death. It is the day before Good Friday, or the day on which Jesus Christ is believed to be crucified and died. Some churches recreate the washing of the feet with the priest washing the feet of certain individuals. The evening of Maundy Thursday also is the start of the “Pascal Triduum” or the days on which the passion, crucifixion, death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ are commemorated. - Latest - Trending",

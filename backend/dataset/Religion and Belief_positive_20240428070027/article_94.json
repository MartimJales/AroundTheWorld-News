    "text": "Pope at Chrism Mass: Dear priests, let sorrow sanctify you Source: Vatican Media At 9.30 this morning, Holy Thursday, in the Vatican Basilica, Pope Francis presided over the Chrism Mass, attended by hundreds of priests. During this liturgy, celebrated on this day in all Cathedral Churches around the world, priests renewed the vows they made at the moment of their Holy Ordination. This was followed by the blessing of the oil for the sick, the oil of catechumens, and the Chrism. In his homily, Pope Francis thanked priests for their heroic witness, but encouraged them to transform shortcomings, errors, and hardened hearts into an opportunity to draw closer to Christ and start anew.

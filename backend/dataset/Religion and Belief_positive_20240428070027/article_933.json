    "text": "Foundation House Ministries receives $790,000 state grant CLEVELAND, Tenn. (WDEF) – A ministry that serves mothers in crisis received a large grant Thursday. Foundation House Ministries in Cleveland has received a $790,000 grant from the State of Tennessee. This is a part of over $20 million invested in non-profits by the state that work in maternal health care. Foundation House says they are the only crisis center within 150 miles serving mothers who are facing a crisis, and they say this will help them expand their reach. Their executive director, Suzanne Burns, said, “Our mission is actually to rescue a generation of mothers, who will be equipped to rescue their own children, or whose children will never need rescuing in the first place. So, having this additional money will actually double the amount of moms we are able to serve right now.” In their 10 years of service, Foundation House has served over 120 mothers through housing them and over 600 others through other services.",

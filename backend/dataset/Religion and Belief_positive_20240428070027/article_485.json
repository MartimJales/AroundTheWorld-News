Mamata Banerjee (@MamataOfficial) March 29, 2024 According to the ANI report, devotees in Kerala participate in processions bearing wooden crosses to commemorate Jesus Christs crucifixion. Good Friday services are held at churches to commemorate the upcoming Easter Sunday. Similarly, prayers and services are held in churches throughout the country, including the Sacred Heart Cathedral Church in New Delhi. Father Jolly of the CBCI Centre expounded on the meaning of Good Friday, emphasising its importance to Christians worldwide. He emphasised that Good Friday is a day set aside to memorialise Jesus Christs suffering and death, to sanctify and purify ourselves, the report added. In Thiruvananthapuram and Kolkata, stations of the cross processions are held to commemorate Christs agony during his crucifixion. Good Friday is the day Jesus was betrayed by Judas and crucified by the Romans, followed by his resurrection on Easter Sunday. Good Friday commemorates Jesus Christs sacrifice and teachings, prompting people to reflect on compassion, forgiveness, and the journey of faith.",

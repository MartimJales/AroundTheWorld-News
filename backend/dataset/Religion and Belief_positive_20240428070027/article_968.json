    "text": "For 35 years, a devotee in Barangay San Pedro Cutud in San Fernando, Pampanga has been demonstrating his faith by reenacting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\nRuben Enaje was among those who were nailed to the cross for the Good Friday tradition, according to Chino Gaston’s report on “24 Oras”.\n“Di ko pa masabi sa ngayon. Kung sa susunod na taon wala pang makita, ewan ko na lang. Basta kaya ng katawan ko,” Enaje said.\n(I still cannot say by now. If they can’t find anyone to replace me next year then I’ll continue. I will do it as long as my body permits.)\nThe local government of Cutud said at least 20,000 visitors flocked to the crucifixion site to witness the annual tradition. Some of them are foreigners who went to the province to watch the crucifixion.\n“Faith is super strong. People can sacrifice themselves to this extent,” a foreign national said.\nIn Tondo, Manila dozens of half-naked devotees went around six parishes, whipping their backs until they were bloody in a religious ritual that they said would help take away their sins.\nMany Filipino Catholics go through religious penance during Holy Week as a form of worship and prayer believed to grant their wishes, cleanse their sins, and cure illnesses.\nFather Randy Flores said there was no need to hurt oneself to get forgiveness from God.\n“Labag po yan sa paggalang sa sarili, sa katawan bilang templo ng Espiritu Santo… Emulate yung halimbawa ng ginawa Niya. Apply ang Kaniyang mga itinuro na mahalin ang kapwa katulad ng pagmamahal sa sarili,” said Fr. Flores.\n(It’s against respect for themselves, their bodies as a temple of the Holy Spirit… We should emulate His example. Apply what He taught us about loving our fellows as we love ourselves)\nThe Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines also earlier said that while it does not condone the tradition, it also does not endorse the activity.\nIn Boracay, residents and visitors joined the traditional Way of the Cross or Via Crucis to commemorate Jesus' passion and death on the cross.\nThe local government earlier ordered a ban on loud music for the entire Good Friday on the popular resort island.\nIn Quiapo, Manila, at least 700,000 flocked to the church to observe Good Friday.\nAccording to Sandra Aguinaldo's \"24 Oras report\", some of the attendees joined the early morning procession of the image of the Black Nazarene, while others reflected on the Seven Last Words of Christ at the church before attending the Holy Mass.\nThe devotees endured the warm and humid weather and scattered rains to join the procession of the \"Santo Entierro.\"\n\"Dito na tayo humuhugot ng lakas ...wala naman tayong aasahan kundi 'yung nasa taas (This is where we draw our strength ...we don't have anyone else to rely on except on the one up there),\" Ronaldo Mariano, a devotee, said. —Sundy Locus\\/LDF, GMA Integrated News",

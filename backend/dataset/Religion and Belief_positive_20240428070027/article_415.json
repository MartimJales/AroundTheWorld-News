This commemorates Jesus Christ’s passion, crucifixion and death.\nEaster is also an occasion for family visits and spending quality time with one another.\nIf you are travelling, be safe on the roads and have yourself a fantastic long weekend!\nAlso read:\nCommunity faces water interruptions\nThe staff and management of the Ladysmith Gazette take this opportunity to wish all our readers a happy and blessed Easter.\nThe news provided to you in this link comes to you from the editorial staff of the Ladysmith Gazette, a sold newspaper distributed in the Ladysmith area.\nPlease follow us on our\nYouTube channel and do not be shy; please subscribe and comment as well.

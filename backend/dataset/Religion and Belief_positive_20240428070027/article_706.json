    "text": "As Idaho Christians gather together on Easter to celebrate the life and legacy of Jesus Christ, it is an ideal time to reflect on his wisdom that cuts across all of society. He was a powerful advocate for the poor, downtrodden and oppressed. Jesus urged us to love one another and treat others as we wished to be treated. He admonished us to take in strangers, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and give drink to the thirsty. He was strongly committed to social justice and expected the same of his followers.\nThese principles are quite common to the world’s organized religions and widely recognized outside of the sectarian world. If most of society generally observed these teachings, we would not have anywhere near the anger, fear, hatred and discord that currently afflicts our everyday lives in Idaho and the rest of the nation. I believe a major reason for the current strife-ridden state of affairs is our increasing failure to follow an important, but often ignored, Christian touchstone.\nJesus was one of the earliest and most important advocates for separation of church and state. As he succinctly put it: “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” In other words, our government acts in the temporal realm, while God is in control of the spiritual realm. We have seen a blurring of those lines in Idaho in recent years, with some zealous Christian organizations seeking to use the government to regulate everyday life in accordance with their religious views.",

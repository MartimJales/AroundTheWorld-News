    "text": "Good Friday: day of prayer and reflection for Christians 29.03.2024 11:30 Today, the Catholic Church commemorates Good Friday, marking the solemn occasion of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. St. Anne's Church in Warsaw. PHOTO: PAP/BARTŁOMIEJ ZBOROWSKI It is a day of deep prayer, reflection, and a reenactment of Christ's sacrifice, with no Mass celebrated—a unique aspect of the liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church. Priest Jan Sikorski elucidated the significance of the Cross as central to Christian faith, describing it as both a symbol of salvation and profound suffering. \"On Giewont [mountain in the Tatra range] stands the Cross, between Heaven and earth. A sign of Salvation, but at the same time a sign of immense suffering,\" Sikorski emphasized, as quoted by Polish Radio’s IAR news agency. The liturgy on Good Friday includes the solemn Liturgy of the Passion, where the Cross, adorned in purple cloth, is displayed. Following the liturgy, the Cross remains accessible for faithful to venerate, symbolizing the adoration of Christ's sacrifice. The Blessed Sacrament is then processioned and placed in the Tomb for adoration until morning. In Warsaw, Bishop Piotr Jarecki will lead the Liturgy of the Lord's Passion at the Archcathedral, followed by the traditional Central Way of the Cross from St. Anne's Academic Church, led by Cardinal Kazimierz Nycz, IAR reported. As per tradition, Good Friday is observed with strict fasting. Polish Radio’s Program 1 will broadcast Masses and services from the Holy Cross Basilica in Warsaw. Meanwhile, Pope Francis will preside over the Way of the Cross at the Vatican, accompanied by meditations authored for the occasion, to be broadcasted on state broadcaster TVP 1 program at 21:05. Warsaw City Hall has announced that Stations of the Cross and Resurrection processions will pass through the streets of Warsaw on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Traffic on the roads may be temporarily stopped during the celebrations. (jh) Source: IAR",

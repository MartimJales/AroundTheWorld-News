    "text": "An original Easter musical that portrays the crucifixion of Jesus Christ from the perspective of his Father is being staged at the St Joseph's College of Law auditorium in Bengaluru on Saturday and Sunday by the All People's Church. The musical titled ‘Not Forgotten’ a musical theatre adaptation of the crucifixion of Christ has a 90-member crew, including 50 cast members. \"The crucifixion story never fails to tug at heartstrings, but here’s a brand new interpretation of the timeless story, exploring what was going on in the mind of the Father God, while Jesus was being mocked, flogged and nailed to the cross?\" the All People’s Church said in a note. The original script comprises five acts, 12 scenes, two original songs, five familiar worship songs, innovative sets, lights and sound design, an LED wall, a live band and singers. Opening with the infamous ‘Judas kiss’ betrayal scene the musical looks at the ‘Lazarus come out!’ scene, Pilate’s courtyard torture scene, a 'Trinity Talk’ scene on why heaven was silent. The play ends with a resurrection and celebration. The shows are scheduled at 6.30 pm on Saturday (March 30) and at 10.30 am on Sunday (March 31) at the St Joseph’s College of Law Auditorium, Field Marshal Cariappa Road, Ashok Nagar.

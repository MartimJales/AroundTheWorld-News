    "text": "(New York Jewish Week) — The Jewish Democratic Council of America, the leading Jewish organization affiliated with the Democratic Party, endorsed George Latimer in his bid to unseat New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman in the upcoming primary.\nIt also endorsed Wesley Bell in his campaign to unseat Rep. Cori Bush in Missouri, marking the first time that the Jewish Democrats have endorsed primary challengers to Democratic incumbents.\nBoth incumbents have been vocal critics of Israel. In New York’s 16th district, which covers southern Westchester County and a sliver of the northern Bronx and is home to a sizable Jewish community, the Israel-Hamas war has become a focal point of the closely-watched campaign.\nLatimer, a centrist who serves as Westchester County executive, has been firmly supportive of Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Bowman, who is a member of the Squad, the group of progressive Democratic members of Congress, has been harshly critical of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, accusing Israel of “genocide.”\nThe Jewish Democratic Council of America announced its endorsement of Latimer on Thursday alongside 21 other candidates, including New Yorkers Mondaire Jones in the 17th district and Josh Riley in the 19th district.",

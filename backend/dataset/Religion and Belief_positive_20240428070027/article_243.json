    "text": "For nature and humanity to flourish, we must adopt a whole-of-society approach to conservation.\nThis was the message delivered by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pacific’s director Dr Mark Drew at the opening of the Oceania First Voices Forum in Suva on Tuesday.\nHe said this approach to conservation recognised the equal importance of all segments of society, which included Government, business, civil society, indigenous people, local communities, women, youth, and individuals.\n“We acknowledge the urgent need to address the historical lack of inclusiveness, equity, and justice faced by indigenous peoples and local communities across the Pacific and Oceania,” he said.\n“The year 2030 looms near, and with it, the imperative to support our first voices of Oceania in advancing a conservation model that is just, fair, and inclusive.\n“We recognise that achieving our 2030 goals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss and meet the 1.5-degree target is impossible without the active involvement of indigenous peoples and local communities.”\nDr Drew also referred the 2021 State of Indigenous Peoples’ and Local Communities’ Lands and Territories report, which was compiled by conservation experts in consultation with indigenous peoples and local communities. He said the report presented unequivocal evidence that the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution required the full inclusion of indigenous and local communities.\n“WWF, as a global conservation organisation, is undergoing a paradigm shift in our approach to conservation.\n“Central to this transformation is our commitment to robust collaboration with indigenous peoples and local communities, particularly those from the Oceania region.”",

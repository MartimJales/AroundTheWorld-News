    "text": "(Minghui.org) Falun Dafa practitioners held an information day in Antwerpen’s city center on March 23, 2024 to introduce the traditional mind-body practice of Falun Dafa. After learning how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) persecutes the spiritual discipline, many people signed petitions calling to end the brutality, and two Chinese students quit the CCP organizations they previously joined. Located in northwestern Belgium, Antwerpen is the country’s third largest city. Known as the hub of the world’s diamond trade, it also has the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It’s an important city for the region, historically, economically and culturally. [Falun Dafa practitioners held an information day on March 23, 2024 in Antwerpen’s city center.](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-02.jpg) [Practitioners talk to people about Falun Dafa.](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-04.jpg) [People sign petitions urging an end to the persecution in China. ](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-05.jpg) College Student: The Suppression Is Vicious Tianka from Albania is a student at KU Leuven. After she and a friend stopped by the Falun Dafa booth and read the materials, she thanked practitioners for holding the event. She said that she did not know about Falun Dafa or the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. “More people need to know what is going on in China so that they will have a chance to sign the petitions and stop the tragedies in China,” Tianka explained. “What is happening in China is wrong. We must end the suppression because it is so vicious.” Upon leaving, she thanked practitioners again and said, “The principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance are very good. I like them very much.” [Veronica signed a petition to support practitioners. ](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-07.jpg) Veronica was on her way to a train station when she stopped at the table to sign a petition. She said that she first heard about Falun Dafa during an event in Stuttgart, but she did not have time to sign a petition at the time. A practitioner thanked Veronica for signing and suggested she check online for more information about Falun Dafa. “I definitely will,” Veronica said as she hurried to the train station. Falun Dafa Brings Peace Two engineers, Antonio and Seda, stopped to watch as practitioners demonstrated the Falun Dafa exercises. In a conversation with a practitioner, Antonio said this was the first time he’d heard about Falun Dafa. He explained that he was interested in meditation, and found it amazing that practitioners were able to peacefully mediate in the noisy, crowded city center. He and Seda agreed that the principles of Falun Dafa were important for everyone. [Engineers Antonio and Seda agree with Falun Dafa’s principles. ](/u/article_images/2024-3-27-belgium-antwerpen-08.jpg) They were sorry to hear about the persecution in China and wished practitioners well. “Falun Dafa brings us peace, and improves people’s minds and bodies,” Seda affirmed. Flory, a teacher, talked with practitioners for a long time. “The principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance are the best for everyone and they can make our lives more meaningful,” Flory said. As a teacher, he understands the importance of explaining these values to students. He believed doing so could improve children’s growth of mind and body, and he thanked practitioners for their efforts. Chinese Students Renounce CCP Organizations Two Chinese students also joined the crowd reading materials at the table. They did not know much about Falun Dafa, but knew the practice was not allowed in China. Seeing so many Westerners practicing Falun Dafa, they were curious and wanted to find out why. A practitioner explained what Falun Dafa is, and said that practitioners align their words and behavior according to the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. He went on to say that the five sets exercises are greatly beneficial both physically and spiritually, and this is why Falun Dafa is now practiced in over 100 countries. The students said they agreed with the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. The practitioner told them the CCP could not tolerate traditional values so it began targeting practitioners in 1999, just like it suppressed other groups in numerous political campaigns in the past. To achieve this, the regime made up defamatory hate propaganda to deceive people, such as the [staged Tiananmen Square Self-Immolation Incident](https://en.minghui.org/cc/88/). The practitioner also told the students that the CCP detains and tortures practitioners for their belief, and even kills them for their organs. The students said they’d joined the CCP’s Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers when they were children. They were happy to renounce their memberships in these organizations, for a better future.

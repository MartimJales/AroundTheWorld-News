    "text": "- By [Priyanka Munshi](/authors/priyanka-munshi) - Published: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 10:04 AM (IST) - Source:JND Good Friday And Easter Sunday 2024:Christians around the world place great importance on sharing verses from the Bible during Good Friday and Easter. These verses convey the main concepts of Jesus Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. Easter celebrates Jesus' triumphant resurrection, signifying new life and eternal hope, while Good Friday remembers his crucifixion, emphasizing themes of atonement and forgiveness. Sharing these verses encourages self-awareness, growth in faith, and unity among believers. It also serves as a reminder of the key moments in the history of the Christian religion. By sharing these verses, believers engage in a custom that fortifies their faith, expands their understanding of God's love, and extends an invitation to others to experience the significance and joy of these holy days. For these special days, we have compiled a list of Bible verses that you can share with your loved ones. Thinking of you on this special day! Best wishes for Easter and the season ahead.

He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. Mark 10:34 who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.” May the Almighty shower you and your loved ones with the choicest blessings. Sending warm wishes on Good Friday to you! (Image Credit: Freepik) Matthew 12:40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Romans 5:6-10 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. 1 Peter 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. Mark 9:31 For he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.” I pray that the love of Jesus will always fill your heart with divine happiness. (Image Credit: Freepik) Mark 10:34 And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise. 1 Peter 2:24 “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” I wish you a solemn Good Friday and pray that your faith never wavers from God. (Image Credit: Freepik) Isaiah 53:5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. Easter Sunday 2024 Bible Verses Matthew 28:5-8 The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.” So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 1 Peter 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Happy Easter to my favorite Peeps! (Image Credit: Freepik) 1 Thessalonians 4:14 For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. Romans 8:11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. John 11:25-26 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?” Faith makes all things possible. (Image Credit: Freepik) John 6:40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.” 1 Corinthians 6:14 And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Romans 6:4 We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. Happy Easter! May this day be as special and beautiful as you. (Image Credit: Freepik) Isaiah 26:19 Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy!

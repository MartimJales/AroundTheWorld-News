    "text": "The 551 matriculating students of McPherson University have been charged to imbibe the godly values of the faith-based university and to also embrace academic and professional excellence.\nThe university, on the occasion of its 12th matriculation ceremony on its campus in Seriki Sotayo, Ogun State, on Wednesday, matriculated 128 students from the College of Humanities, Social, and Management Sciences; 25 from the College of Natural and Applied Sciences; 210 from the College of Allied Health Sciences; 87 from the College of Computing; 32 from the College of Law; 48 from the Centre of Continuing Education (part-time); and 21 from the College of Postgraduate Studies, making a total of 551 students.\nThe vice chancellor of the university, Professor Francis Igbasan, stated that he was happy that the enrollment of students had significantly increased compared to previous years and that in the coming years, they would record higher enrollment and better academic services.\nProfessor Igbasan stressed that he was happy with the matriculating students who had come to fulfil their academic goals at the university, adding that their mission is to build students for excellence and integrity, for service to society and the world at large.\n“This means you must imbibe our culture, values, and virtues. The major reason you have been admitted to this prestigious university is primarily to add value to yourself. The skills you will learn here will make a difference wherever you find yourself in the near future,” Professor Igbasan said.\nThe vice chancellor urged the matriculating students to take their relationship with God seriously, adding that chapel attendance is compulsory for every student.\nHe stressed that the university has zero tolerance for sexual immorality, drug use and abuse, examination malpractices, and other social vices. He further stressed that the university will not harbour drug abusers, peddlers, gamblers, pilfers, or those who bully fellow students or constitute a threat to life and property on campus.\n“The university will not overlook any act of indiscipline within the university. Therefore, my counsel is that you avoid acts that can lead to the termination of your studentship,” Professor Igbasan advised.\nThe acting registrar of the university, Mr Olufemi Adebowale, advised the matriculating students to study the student handbook distributed by Directorate of Student Affairs and abide by the rules and regulations in the handbook.\nAdebowale also advised the new students to sign the matriculation oath, which was an important part of the ceremony and will make them bonafide members of the university community.\nOn the same day, after the matriculation ceremony, the maiden edition of the Vice Chancellor’s Cup football match was played on the university campus between Lyon FC and Benfica FC, the two top teams in the university’s league.\nBenfica FC won the cup with a 3–2 win. While the acting registrar presented the medals to Lyon FC after the match, the vice chancellor presented the medals to the winning Benfica FC.\nALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\nAlake declares value addition as standard for mining in Nigeria Okuama: Slain Soldiers’ burial to hold today in Abuja Why we have not yet nominated Olakulehin as new Olubadan —Kingmaker Cost of borrowing to rise as CBN raises benchmark interest rate to 24.75% Tinubu appoints Laka as coordinator, National Counter-Terrorism Centre Reps organise fact-finding meeting into Kaduna drone mishap",

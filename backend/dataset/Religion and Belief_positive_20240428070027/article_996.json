    "text": "IBADAN – A Chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) in Oyo State, Dr Kazeem Adesina Abidikugu has felicitated with Christians in Ibadan land and Oyo state in general as they join other Christians globally for this year’s Easter celebration.\nEaster is an event that commemorates resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. It also symbolises Christ’s victory over sin and death.\nIn a statement issued personally on Friday, Abidikugu called on Christians to imbibe the virtues of love, sacrifice, and compassion associated with the season.\nAccording to him, “I send my best wishes to Christians in Ibadan and all over Oyo State who are celebrating Easter this Sunday. As we all enjoy the well-deserved break, I urge every residents of Ibadan and Oyo State to reflect on the priceless sacrifice and limitless love of God for mankind.\n“As we celebrate, let us also remember our obligation, as God’s children, to love our neighbour, regardless of tongue, faith and tribe.\n“For Christians everywhere, this celebration is in commemoration of Jesus Christ’s life of service and his supreme sacrifice for the salvation of mankind.\nAbidikugu who was a PDP House of Representatives Aspirant for Ibadan South East / North East Federal Constituency in the build up to the 2023 general election urges Christians to use the period of Easter to pray for our dear country, Nigeria, Oyo State and leaders both at the Federal and at the state level.\n“The Easter also marked the end of 40 – day Lent period, during which the Christians observed piety, I want us to use the period of Easter therefore to pray for the repositioning of our country’s economy and to celebrate with our leader and governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde and appreciate him for the good work he is doing”.\nAbidikugu who is a Nigerian United Kingdom based Psychiatric Consultant, wishes the Christian community a peaceful Easter celebration devoid of violence and bloodshed.",

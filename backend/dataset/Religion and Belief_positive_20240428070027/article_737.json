    "text": "Almost a month ago, Jono Carroll decided to convert to Islam. Since then, he’s been on a spiritual journey and recently went on a pilgrimage to Mecca for the first time in his life. However, amidst this new endeavor, Carroll’s love affair with the ‘sweet science’ remains steadfast. Currently, the Dubliner is breathing down the neck of WBA super featherweight champion Lamont Roach. After a two-year wait following his eliminator win, Carroll has finally been named mandatory challenger. ‘King Kong’ isn’t shying away from the challenge. He acknowledges Roach’s strength but questions his reign, implying there have been weaker champions during his extended wait. To celebrate getting a shot at the title, he visited the holy city of Mecca. JONO CARROLL IS ENAMORED BY THE BROTHERHOOD In the documentation of his time spent in Mecca, Jono shared a glimpse of his spiritual journey at the holy place. Posting on social media, Carroll described his awe at being in the holy city for the first time. He tried to capture the pre-dawn atmosphere at Mecca, where he was fascinated by the energy and the the pilgrims present at the sacred site. In the video, he said, “About to do Mecca. Half-three in the morning, we out here baby. Look at this, everyone out here at half-three. Look at how powerful this is, I’m here with all my brothers. Experiencing this for the very first time, Inshallah I’m here many more times.” He was mesmerized by the beauty around him and the amount of people who had visited at the same time as him. He said, “This is such a powerful place, the energy is like electrifying, sweating, just walk around the place and it’s half three-four o’clock in the morning, so beautiful.” He reflected on the simple pleasures, the taste of dates, and the shared experience with his fellow Muslims. This sudden change in his life didn’t happen overnight, he was always fascinated by the ideologies of Islam, and that’s what he said in a video right before he became a Muslim. CARROLL’S JOURNEY TO BECOME THE BEST VERSION OF HIMSELF Irish boxer Jono Carroll’s journey to Islam has been a story of exploration and self-discovery. Early social media posts reveal his fascination with the Muslim community and their practices, particularly the emphasis on daily prayer. He highlights the “positivity” and “energy” he feels when surrounded by Muslims. This curiosity blossomed into a personal commitment. [https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-jono-carroll-secures-majority-decision-victory-over-andy-vences/] Carroll recently announced his conversion to Islam on Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4ANDhbRCoX/?igsh=b2syb2RlNzRqajQ4], describing it as “a long time coming.” His decision seems fueled by a desire for self-improvement and a sense of belonging. He mentions a yearning to live a “more disciplined life” and become “the best version of himself.” Carroll expresses profound gratitude to the “beautiful brothers” who guided him on this path. Carroll has taken an extra step towards Islam. Now, the fans would expect him to get back in the ring soon, and hopefully he’ll find a way to do so. Do you feel inspired by Carroll’s journey?

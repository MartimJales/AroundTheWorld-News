    "text": "Maa Durga is expected to arrive on her horse during this Chaitra Navratri.\nChaitra Navratri is going to start on April 9 and will continue for nine days. This Navratri will conclude with the onset of Ram Navami. According to Pandit Pankaj Pathak, during the nine days of Chaitra Navratri, Maa Durga resides on Earth to bless her devotees. Chaitra Navratri starts from the Pratipada date of Shukla Paksha of Chaitra month. The belief suggests that this year, goddess Durga will visit the Earth on her horse. As per the Hindu calendar, the Pratipada date of Shukla Paksha of Chaitra month will start on April 8 at 11:50 pm. Along with this, it will end the next day, April 9, at 08:30 pm which will commence Chaitra Navratri.\nThis time Chaitra Navratri will be held for nine days. According to the Hindu scriptures, the occurrence of Tithi in Navratri is considered inauspicious. The Chaitra Navratri will conclude on April 17. Similarly, Ghatasthapana Muhurta is from 06:02 am to 10:16 am (duration â€“ 4 hours 14 minutes) followed by Abhijit Muhurta for Kalash Sthapana which is expected to take place from 11:57 am to 12:48 minutes (51 minutes).\nMaa Durga is expected to arrive on her horse during this Chaitra Navratri. However, this vehicle is not considered auspicious as it indicates war and natural disasters. Goddess Durga vehicles are considered an indicator of auspicious and inauspicious results. It is believed to have a huge impact on nature and human life. The changed vehicle of the Maa Durga indicates that there is a change in power.\nChaitra Navratri Dates\nFirst day:- 9 April 2024 Pratipada Tithi, Ghatasthapana Maa Shailputri Puja.\nSecond day:- 10 April 2024 Dwitiya Tithi Maa Brahmacharini Puja.\nThird day:- 11 April 2024, Tritiya Tithi Maa Chandraghanta Puja.\nFourth day:- 12 April 2024 Chaturthi Tithi Maa Kushmanda Puja.\nFifth day:- 13 April 2024 Panchami Tithi Maa Skandamata Puja.\nSixth day:- 14 April 2024 Shashthi Tithi Maa Katyayani Puja.\nSeventh day:- 15 April 2024 Saptami Tithi Maa Kalratri Puja.\nEighth day:- 16 April 2024 Ashtami Tithi Maa Mahagauri Puja.\nNinth day:- 17 April 2024 Navami Tithi Maa Siddhidatri Puja, Ram Navami",

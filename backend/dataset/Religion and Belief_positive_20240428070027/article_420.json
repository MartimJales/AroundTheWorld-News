    "text": "ISEGHE AJAYI\nIn less than three days, we will be celebrating Easter, a joyous occasion that most Christians look forward to every year even though it is associated with expenses.\nThere is no doubt that this year’s Easter celebrations are not an exception but the fact remains that there is no money to spend due to the high cost of living.\nBut then, you can still enjoy the occasion by setting your priorities right and making the most of what you have for a pleasurable celebration. Besides, the occasion is not for making unnecessary expenses, it is a period of sober reflection, self-examination, and appreciating the finished work Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary.\nEaster celebration also marks the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, in marking the celebrations, there is a need to take a cursory look at your purchases to avoid incurring debts. Remember, there are obligatory bills such as school fees to take care of after the festive period.\nTherefore, while it is good to celebrate the occasion with whatever you can afford, it is also expedient to be economical, and avoid impulse buying because chances are that you may spend more than what you budgeted for.\nEnsure you are emotionally prepared while making your purchases this season, so as not to create room for impulse buying that may lead to financial regrets later. Impulse buying can be a very hazardous urge that entails spending your money on needless items instantly.\nThere is certainly no prior planning on purchasing items that are not included in the budget list. However, small items such as drinks or snacks are permissible and viewed as impulse purchases especially if not built into your buying list.\nThe best way to avoid impulse buying is to make do with your shopping list, keep track of your spending habits, and work within your budget or shopping list.\nThe under-listed tips will help you to shop wisely this Easter to avoid financial regrets:\nAbide By Your Shopping List\nOne of the main impulse buying drawbacks is at the grocery store especially if you cannot control your spending habits.\nThat is why it is important to try as much as possible to make a comprehensive shopping list and remind yourself before you make your purchases that you are going to abide by your list. Although it may be quite difficult to shop in a very big mall and buy only one or two items without making additional unplanned purchases.\nTo curb such, it is vital to create a detailed food or grocery list when shopping as it would help you to stick to your purchases and shun impulse buying.\nSet Your Priorities Right\nInstead of buying a product you did not include in your shopping list but you desired to have it, take a picture of it and make a promise to return to the store the next day if you still need it.\nBut, you will discover that the willpower to procure the item the first time you saw it has decreased after 24 hours and you may tend to drop the idea of obtaining it.\nIt is very essential not to be in a rush to purchase an item that you can do without or, worse still, not budgeted for.\nDo Not Shop When Worried\nPeople do all sorts of abnormal things particularly when they are distressed.\nThey try to make themselves cheerful again. Shopping just happens to be one of them and it can get costly and out of control.\nIt is advisable to avoid shopping alone when you are emotionally down as you may not make the most use of your money.\nDiscover a healthier medium or what interests you the most to help reduce stress before making your purchases.\nAvoid Emotional Ownership Of A Product\nShop for items you have indicated on your list and do not spend much time around a product you have no plan of buying as studies have shown that the more time you laze around a product, the more likely you tend to buy it. Handling products makes consumers more likely to purchase them because their minds have taken “emotional ownership” of the product such that they may be willing to pay more to have the product or item.\nPay With Cash\nIt is preferable to pay with cash when shopping to avoid unnecessary spending.\nAlthough using your credit or debit cards to procure items seemed to be more convenient as you do not need to carry cash along with you.\nBut, the truth of the matter is that, with your debit or credit card, you tend to spend more which may do you no good.\nWhen you pay with cash for items obtained, you are bound to limit your purchases so as not to be stranded but with a credit card, you can go on and on, buying to your satisfaction. Credit cards give individuals an easy way to make impulse purchases, but consumers need to stay away from them because of the high-interest rates associated with most cards.\nMake Inquiry On Every Purchase\nEnsure you ask questions on purchases made; you can also develop the habit of asking yourself questions like, Do I need this? How much did I work to earn the money to pay for this? How much did this cost to make? Are the items worth the amount? By asking questions about every item you intend to buy, you will avoid pointless spending or purchases.\nDo Not Be Tricked By Sales Discounts\nTraders like to use “temporary” and “one-time” discounts and sales to form a sense of urgency that will prompt you to buy items you did not plan for, even if you do not need them now.\nWhat you need to do to overcome such is to be resilient and in doing so, remember that deals come and go, and the price will likely fall again.\nPurchase Item You Can Return\nIf you have a problem with impulse buying, ensure you only buy products from stores that have good return procedures.\nOccasionally, if you give yourself a day or two to ponder, “Do I need this?” you might find yourself wanting to return several items that you bought.",

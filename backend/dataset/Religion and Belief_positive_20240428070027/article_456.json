This announcement comes as a part of the Good Friday and Easter celebrations.\nThe CM has declared a bonus of Rs5000 for each Christian employee. The LWMC’s HR department has confirmed this in an official notification. As per the notification, the bonus will benefit 9199 sanitary workers, 73 supervisors, 250 drivers, and 6 helpers.\nIn addition to this, a comprehensive zero waste operation will be carried out across the city before the Good Friday holiday. LWMC’s CEO, Babar Din, has assured that all workers will put in extra hours in the field to ensure the cleaning of the city’s 266 churches before the Easter celebrations.\nSpecial attention will be given to the 78 Christian Colonies where manual sweeping and scraping processes will be carried out. The operational machinery will be active in the field on both Good Friday and Easter.\nCEO Babar Sahib Din has called upon the citizens to support the LWMC staff in their efforts to keep the city clean. He reiterated the importance of cleanliness and urged the citizens to do their part in maintaining the city’s cleanliness during the Easter celebrations.",

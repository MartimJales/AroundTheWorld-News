    "text": "Missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were all smiles as they recently loaded furniture donated by Resource Teachers of Learning and Behaviour (RTLB) onto trucks to be sent in shipping containers to Samoa Victim Support. “As an organization, RTLB consists of specialist teachers that work closely with 70 schools on the North Shore, Auckland, to meet the social, emotional and educational needs of the students,” explains Jill Watt, RTLB Cluster 4 Practice Leader. “We are passionate about supporting children and their families.” Missionaries of the Church regularly give community service as part of their missionary experience. They also teach people about Jesus Christ, His teachings, and the restoration of His Church. “Helping out with moving the furniture was genuinely delightful, especially in the company of my fellow missionaries,” said Elder Eugene Waetford of Sydney, Australia, a missionary who worked on this project. “We are happy to help with literally anything, but knowing who we were helping made our service all the sweeter.” Regarding the service of the missionaries, Watt assured, “we are extremely grateful for the invaluable assistance provided by the polite, young missionaries, who helped us move the office furniture. Their professionalism, efficiency, and courteous demeanor made the entire process smooth and stress-free.” Watt added, “Their willingness to go above and beyond to ensure everything was handled with care truly made a difference. We extend our heartfelt thanks to them for their exceptional service.” Missionaries volunteer from all over the world for the Church. Those who happily participated in this project were Elder Waetford, Sydney, Australia; Elder Takamura, Japan; Elder Evans, Nevada USA; and Elder Lavaka, Tonga. Watt says that they “genuinely hope that the furniture will benefit the significant work carried out by the Samoa Victim Support organisation.” The mission of Samoa Victim Support is to protect the rights of women, children, and vulnerable populations and to support and care for those victims of violence.",

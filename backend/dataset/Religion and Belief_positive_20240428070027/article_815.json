While the first season mostly concentrated on [Kari Baxter](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-episode-3-takeaway-is-kari-baxter-pregnant-kari-baxters-revelation-rocks-tim-baxter)'s ( [Ali Cobrin](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-finale-episode-takeaway-how-did-tim-jacob-die-kari-baxter-in-shambles-over-husbands-death)) tumultuous marriage, the second season gives greater attention to [Ashley Baxter](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-season-3-episode-10-why-the-baxter-family-is-upset-with-ashley-baxter-her-decision-to-help-luke-baxter-leads-to-chaos) ( [Masey McLain](https://meaww.com/prime-videos-family-drama-show-the-baxters-wins-hearts-fans-demand-more-in-season-4)) and Luke Baxter ( [Josh Plasse](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-finale-episode-takeaway-how-did-tim-jacob-die-kari-baxter-in-shambles-over-husbands-death)), two additional Baxter children. In the second season's last episode, Ashley divulges a shocking story about her past, something she still feels guilty about. On the other hand, Kari and [Ryan Taylor](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-season-2-episode-9-takeaway-does-ryan-taylor-reveal-the-truth-about-ashley-to-kari-baxter) ( [Jake Allyn](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-season-3-episode-6-who-is-diane-jacobs-kari-baxter-faces-a-hurdle-before-her-wedding-with-ryan-taylor)) elevate their relationship with an unanticipated lifetime commitment. Furthermore, Luke has moved on and is prepared to begin a relationship with Lori Callahan (Alexa Sutherland), but he still misses Reagan Decker (Cassidy Gifford). Ashley Baxter shares her dark past in the finale of 'The Baxters' Season 2 Ashley, who is a mother to a kid named Cole, eventually opens up to Landon Blake (Orel De La Mota) about her troubled past. She admits that she had a relationship with a married guy, which resulted in her pregnancy. She confides in Landon that she feels bad about wanting a relationship with a married man. While discussing her past, Ashely breaks down. Landon reassures her that she is not guilty because her experience has given her the greatest blessing in lifeâ€”her son Cole. Ashley thanks him for his encouragement and they share a kiss. Ryan Tylor and Kari Baxter take their relationship to the next level in 'The Baxters' Season 2 After enduring many hardships since season one, Ryan and Kari's relationship is finally beginning to look up. As the couple is seen strolling together, Ryan tells Kari that he loves her unconditionally and that he doesn't want to spend another day apart from her. In a real romantic gesture, the man gets down on his knees and proposes to his lady love with a ring, which she enthusiastically accepts. Elizabeth Baxter misses Luke Baxter in the finale of 'The Baxters' Season 2 Later in the evening, at the memorial garden's opening ceremony, everyone congratulates Kari and Ryan on their new beginnings. The Baxters appeared to be reunited with Erin Baxter (Reilly Anspaugh) and Brooke Baxter-West (Emily Peterson), who were also present with their husbands. [Elizabeth Baxter](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-finale-episode-takeaway-how-did-tim-jacob-die-kari-baxter-in-shambles-over-husbands-death) ( [Roma Downey](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-starring-roma-downey-and-ted-mc-ginley-gets-prime-video-release-date)) says she misses Luke when she sees her entire family together, but John Baxter ( [Ted McGinley](https://meaww.com/lifetime-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-the-wrong-murder-full-cast-list)) reassures her that he will eventually find his way back home. Later, Luke is seen with Lori, who asks that he put Reagan behind him and begin a relationship with her. After some hesitation, Luke chooses to give up his inhibitions. In a surprising turn of events that occurred in the final minutes of the episode, it is revealed that Reagan is pregnant with Luke's kid and that he is oblivious to the fact.

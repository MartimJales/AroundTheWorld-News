    "text": "PLATTSBURGH — Today, Christians observe Good Friday also known as Great Friday, Holy Friday and Black Friday, which commemorates Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and death at Calvary, whose exact location is not known outside of Jerusalem.\nBelow Diocese of Ogdensburg Most Reverend Bishop Terry R. LaValley shares his message for Easter 2024.\n“I am the resurrection and the life, the one who believes in me, though he or she die, yet shall they live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die.”\nDear Sisters and Brothers in Christ:\nYes, the Lord has risen! Satan did all he could to break down the love, courage, and fidelity of our Savior. Evil unleashed its arsenal of hatred, injustice, humiliation, and pain. Evil fought a bloody fight, but the Son of God rose victorious. That means absolutely everything for you and me!\nThe resurrection is the sacred stamp that validates everything Jesus did and said: His claim to be God’s Son; His insistence of authority to forgive sin; His universal call to abandon self- centeredness for love of God and neighbor as the path to true happiness and everlasting peace; and His promise to send the Holy Spirit for guidance to His Mystical Body, our Church.\nJesus was not one more person who finished last, one more dreamer whose dreams were squelched by the harsh reality of life on this earth. Jesus Christ has risen! Jesus’ victory over evil and lies; over injustice and suffering is total and irreversible. In the face of over twenty centuries filled with a steady stream of saints, no reasonable person can deny it.\nLet there be no mistake. Evil still wanders about. However, we remain ever vigilant and grateful for the gifts of the Spirit on our earthly journeys. We share this Good News and express our resurrection joy, even amid today’s trials and tribulation. Christ’s victory over sin and death causes us to always be hope-filled pilgrims of faith because we are Christ-led and Christ-fed.\nAlleluia! Blessed Easter to you and your loved ones! Alleluia!\nFaithfully yours in Christ,\nMost Reverend Terry R. LaValley\nBishop of Ogdensburg",

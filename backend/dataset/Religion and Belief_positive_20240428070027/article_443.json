    "text": "Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has charged Christians across the country to reflect on the significance of Good Friday by imbibing the virtues of sacrifice, love, tolerance and selflessness.\nThe governor stated this in a statement on Friday, in commemoration of Good Friday.\nHe said, “I celebrate with our Christian brothers and sisters as we mark Good Friday, a remembrance of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Calvary for the redemption of mankind.\n“I urge everyone to, in the spirit of the season, reflect on the significance of this day by imbibing the virtues of sacrifice, love, tolerance and selflessness.”\nHe stressed the need to persevere, noting that “There is no better time to show this than now when we are faced with dire economic conditions which have put many in distress.\n“As we celebrate this year’s Good Friday, we must remember to be our brothers’ keeper and look out for each other at this difficult time, while remaining resolute in our love for God and our nation.\n“On behalf of the government of Edo State, I wish all our Christian brothers and sisters a blessed and peaceful Good Friday.”",

The history of our friendship with Kosovo is very long, and I want to emphasize once again the significant place Kosovo holds in our hearts.\"\nSerim noted the rapid development of economic relations between Türkiye and Kosovo as a \"significant factor strengthening the ties between the two countries.\"\nAlso, Prime Minister Kurti highlighted the assistance provided by TIKA for Kosovo's development.\nHe expressed gratitude for TIKA's continuous support, \"excellent cooperation, and contributions to Kosovo's development.\"\nAmbassador Angili emphasized that the \"strong bonds between Kosovo and Türkiye will be even stronger in the future.\"\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

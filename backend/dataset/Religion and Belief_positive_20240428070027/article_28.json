    "text": "Good Friday, the day when Catholics remember and celebrate the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ, marks the middle of the Sacred Triduum. According to Office Holidays , Good Friday is a holiday only in 10 states in the country. Most men and women with jobs need to work. Sometimes they are unable to attend the official Catholic celebrations. Good Friday is a state holiday in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota and Tennessee. It is an optional holiday in Texas. But even in those states, many Catholics cannot miss working because of the nature of their job or because of their economic needs. For example, first responders and utilities’ personnel may need to be available. Good Friday is not a Holy Day of Obligation , but it is a day of strict fasting and abstinence. Some practices can help Catholics make Good Friday spiritually fruitful even if they’re on the clock. Here are some recommendations: - Observe the obligatory day of fasting and abstinence that the Church requires: no meat, and just one full meal, and two smaller meals that together do not equal a full meal. - Shut off the television, computer, social media or your phone for the day. - Avoid shopping or other errands that will distract you from the meaning of the day. - Pray the Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary. - At 3 p.m., remember for a few minutes — or even one — the time of the death of our Lord. - If there is anyone in your life that you need to offer forgiveness to, forgive them today. - Venerate the Cross at home if you can’t make it to church. - Pray or attend the Stations of the Cross. - Consider beginning the Divine Mercy Novena , which starts on Good Friday in preparation for Divine Mercy Sunday. - Share the story of Good Friday with someone in your life.",

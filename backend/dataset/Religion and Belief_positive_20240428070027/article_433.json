    "text": "1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 states, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so, shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.”\nAre you ready for Jesus to return? I often think about how corrupt the world is and the number of people who follow the pattern of the world. Some may think I am judging; however, I am not. I am here to let you know if you are walking after the patterns of this world, you are not following Jesus and you are heading down the wrong road. There are only two roads we can travel – the road that leads to everlasting life in heaven or the road to eternal damnation in fire called hell. Both roads are never ending, but one will lead to never ending torment, while the other leads to eternal bliss. Lately, I have been talking about heaven and hell. We must understand they are real places, and we will live in one or the other when we leave this Earth.",

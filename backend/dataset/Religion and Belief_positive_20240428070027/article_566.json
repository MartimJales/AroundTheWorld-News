    "text": "A lot has been said about Randeep Hooda's physical transformation for his latest film Swatantrya Veer Savarkar. Also helmed by Hooda, it is a biopic of freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. For the movie, the actor lost almost 32 kilos. Not just that, to get into the role mentally, he locked himself in a cell at the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where Savarkar was kept.Randeep Hooda felt Savarkar's presence “I started feeling like Savarkar was the director himself,” he said on BeerBiceps podcast. When asked if he ever felt Savarkar’s presence on set, the actor-director replied, “Yes, in every frame. There were times when I really felt that. I used to feel sometimes, while working, I used to see a shadow, of myself sometimes, and I used to think, ‘Wow, that looks like Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’.”Randeep Hooda on shooting in Kaala PaaniRecalling his experience in the prison, popularly known as Kaala Paani, Randeep said, “I was okay for a while, but then, I felt the walls crashing down on me. I started screaming for help, but my voice wouldn’t travel. I became claustrophobic, I began to lose my breath.”He also spoke about the ghostly silence at night. The actor said that he was able to sense the people who were once imprisoned there. He added that he had taken a big team for the jail sequence, however, nobody dared to wander too far. Swatantrya Veer Savarkar released in the theatres on March 22. The movie opened up to mixed reviews from the audience, however, Hooda's performance has been praised by one and all. It has minted Rs 11.35 crore at the box office so far.",

    "text": "[Featured News](/news/featured) - [Current News](/news) - [Archived News](/news/archive) - [News Categories](/news/category) First of 3 EPs releases today Press Release The cinematic and compelling story of the Book of Revelation has been put to music, courtesy of David and Nicole Binion. As we lead into the celebration of Easter, the timely release of their EP, “The Revelation Of Jesus” (Integrity Music), is available today. It’s the first of three Revelation projects to be released from the Binions this year. Listen to “The Revelation of Jesus” [here](https://t.e2ma.net/click/33gvxk/b2w4wt/7iv7t7). The seven songs found on “The Revelation of Jesus” bring the Book of Revelation to life, illuminating the glory, mystery and encounters between God and man. Inspiration to create the project began one day in May 2020 during the throes of the global pandemic when David was awakened by God’s voice to write the Revelation of Jesus. He explained, \"I was stunned by the invitation, uncertain if I was even qualified to take on such an endeavor. But I told the Lord yes immediately.\" All of the songs were recorded live at the Huckabee Theater in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Joining David and Nicole Binion are featured artists including Danny Gokey, Rita Springer and Mitch Wong, among others. The three projects were produced by David Binion and Daniel Lopez. Leading up to today's release, TBN is set to air the live recording of “The Revelation Of Jesus” on Tuesday, April 16. Check local listings for airtime. David Binion, who co-penned the track “I Was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day” with Krissy Nordoff, reflects on Revelation 1:10, connecting the narrative of John’s experience to his own and to listeners. Track two, \"Patmos,\" written by Binion with Wong, is a favorite of Nicole’s, a raw and melodic piece that reminds listeners of God’s promise “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” \"It is our desire to bring illumination to a new generation of worshipers about the glory and mystery of this beautiful, poetic book of the Bible,\" the Binions shared. \"John shows us the kind of encounters that are possible with God and man. This encounter isn’t only for John, it’s for all of us.\" With the hope that these songs bless the listeners, they added, “In the first few verses of Revelation, John writes, 'Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it.' We want those who hear it, and those who sing it, to receive the blessing of Revelation that was promised.\" About David & Nicole Binion David and Nicole Binion are a Dallas-based husband and wife ministry team sharing a passion to worship God and lead others into his presence. Married for 28 years, the Binions have been in ministry together for almost as long, working with a myriad of artists, evangelists and organizations representing the global church. A few years ago, David and Nicole pursued a long-held dream, launching Dwell Ministries to mentor and train a new generation of worshipers, worship leaders, and church creatives. Since then, the couple planted Dwell Church in Dallas. The Binions, who serve as guest hosts for TBN’s flagship “Praise!” program, also hosted “Dwell Nights” of worship across the U.S. and abroad after their 2018 critically acclaimed album fittingly called “Dwell.” Their most recent album, “Glory of Eden,” came out in 2020 and was followed by multiple collaborations with Integrity Music’s REVERE.

    "text": "MANCHESTER — On Thursday, the Reverend David Fredrickson of the Zion Episcopal Church of Manchester, Reverend Bill Borror of the First Congregational Church of Manchester, and Cantor Scott Buckner of the Israel Congregation of Manchester broke bread together at the Interfaith Council of the Northshire luncheon.\nOver 40 individuals took part in the interfaith luncheon, which was held at the First Congregational Church of Manchester. The meal consisted of soup and bread – and Laura Sokol, a member of both the Israel Congregation of Manchester and the First Congregational Church of Manchester, and others ladled chicken matzo ball soup, a traditional kosher dish for the Jewish holiday of Passover, and tomato soup into bowls as members filed through the line.\nConversation at the event revolved around an educational debate based on source material from both the Christian and Jewish faiths. The question posed and discussed by the Interfaith leaders was: \"Was the Last Supper a Seder?\"\nWhile the matter was left undecided – with Borror making the argument that it was not and Buckner arguing that it was – the gathering was agreeably a success. Jewish texts from the Hebrew scriptures, the Qumran/Essenes , and the Mishnah and Talmud were cited – as were Christian sources, including the gospels of Paul, Mark, and John from the New Testament .\n“The key feature of gatherings like this,” said Buckner, “is that we are bringing the community together to share and learn about each others’ traditions, to continue to develop the kind of care and love and respect that we all have for each other in our work in the community and in the Interfaith Council of the Northshire, and this – interfaith conversations – is an extension of that.”\nAccording to Harvard University's Pluralism Project, interfaith organizations are not a new thing.\n“Interfaith councils were a significant new development in American society in the late 20th century, and they continue to diversify in the present day. Councils of churches, churches and synagogues, and clergy associations have had to face the question of whether to extend the roundtable to include representatives of other religious traditions,” their statement reads. In various communities across the region, interfaith communities have continued to organize and mobilize in an effort to support localized food and heat insecurity needs; to assist the disabled, the homebound, and the elderly with daily chores, errands, and companionship needs; to develop and maintain refugee resettlement projects, and other community needs.\nWhile interfaith councils and gatherings have become more common, Buckner believes that what they’ve created is unique.\n“I think we’ve really carried it to a really wonderful and unique level here. You know, efforts like this are underway all over – but I like to think we’re special because together we do good work,” said Buckner. “That’s part of the mission. We’re really committed to these kinds of conversations that help us support and understand each other.”",

    "text": "As Christains all over the World, celebrate Easter, the Executive Secretary Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission Bishop Stephen Adegbite has enjoined Christians to emulate the virtues of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nBishop Adegbite stressed that if Christians at all level could emulate the virtues of Jesus Christ, Nigeria and the World would be better for it.\nThe NCPC Boss said ” Easter marks the resurrection of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, a culmination of his sacrifice and death in atonement of our sin”.\nHe emphasized that Easter season is the hallmark of our salvation, without which there would be no salvation.\nBishop Adegbite maintained that his Easter message is anchored on sacrifice, humility, open hands and a message of Chief Servant.\nHe advised that leaders must follow what Jesus Christ did for us so that God would hearken to our cries; and Nigeria would not be an abandoned project.\nThe No 1 Christian Pilgrim Officer of the Federation further averred that Easter ushers in hope, grace, trust and peace; it is a season of blessings and sacrifice.He stated\nAdding that Easter is a time for us to reflect on our relationship with God and a time for spiritual upliftment.\nHe is sanguined that we are moving to the season of celebration and that Nigeria is a project of the Lord and would experience grace from the Lord.\nAdegbite urged Christians to continue to pray for the success of the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed TInubu led administration, stating that nothing good comes easy and that Nigeria is not the only Country experiencing economic hardship as it is a Global phenomenon.\nExplaining that the Commission’s mantra for the year is Renewed Hope and Satisfaction, he also celebrated President Bola Ahmed Tinubu whom he described as an indefatigable, proactive, pragmatic Leader and the Father of the Nation on his 72nd birthday Anniversary.\nAdegbite prayed that the Almighty God will continue to bless him and grant him good health of mind and body and excellent wisdom to pilot the affairs of our great Nation in the Mighty Name of Jesus Christ our Lord and savior.\nThis was disclosed in a Press Statement signed and made available to Independent by Celestine Toruka Deputy Director and Head Media and Public Relations of the Commission.",

    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Her Majesty Raja Zarith Sofiah, Queen of Malaysia, has graced a bubur lambuk distribution ceremony at Masjid Jamek Kampong Baru here.\nHer Majesty arrived at the mosque yesterday morning where she had the opportunity to observe the preparation of the savoury rice porridge and mingle with those involved in the event.\nRaja Zarith Sofiah then distributed bubur lambuk to 20 representatives of mosques from seven zones in the Federal Territory, as well as non-governmental organisations.\nAs early as 7am, mosque staff, together with personnel from the Federal Territory Islamic Religious Department (Jawi) and volunteers, joined hands to cook a total of 50 pots of bubur lambuk.\nAbout 12,500 packets of bubur lambuk are expected to be distributed to (kariah members) congregants and the local community, aiming to highlight the mosque’s role as a place of worship and a centre for nurturing goodwill during this holy month, reported Bernama.\nThe programme, organised by Jawi in collaboration with Istana Negara, Masjid Jamek Kampong Baru and Persatuan Anak Melayu Johor, was also attended by Jawi director Datuk Mohd Ajib Ismail, Federal Territory and Selangor Persatuan Anak Melayu Johor president Datuk Seri Dr Syed Hussein Al-Habshee and Masjid Jamek Kampong Bharu chairman Datuk Mohd Khay Ibrahim.\nOpen Modal ×",

Ron Hubbard's research on the nature of man took him down a unique path - the path of poetry. Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL (1888PressRelease) March 29, 2024 - In honor of Aprils National Poetry Month, the Scientology Information Center is highlighting the role poetry played in the early research that culminated in Dianetics and Scientology. The Center, located at 500 Cleveland Street in downtown Clearwater, will feature a short film on exactly this aspect of Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbards life. The Center is open Sunday through Friday from 10:00am to 7:00pm and on Saturdays from 2:00pm to 7:00pm. No appointment is necessary. National Poetry Month was established in 1996 by the Academy of American Poets to celebrate the role of poets in our culture. Per the Academys website, National Poetry Month has become the largest literary celebration in the world, with tens of millions of readers, students, K-12 teachers, librarians, booksellers, literary event curators, publishers families, and of course poets, marking poetrys important place in our lives. Early on in his life, Mr. Hubbard began researching the nature of man one of those research projects was from his days as a student at George Washington University, said Lisa Mansell, from the Public Affairs Office at the Church of Scientology. Poetry was central to this research. Mr. Hubbard would later recount an anecdote about that research in a 1958 lecture. This anecdote has been made into a video presentation which can be viewed at the Scientology Information Center. Mr. Hubbard was an accomplished poet and lyricist in his own right, said Mansell. In addition to creating the soundtracks for the book Battlefield Earth and the Mission Earth series, Mr. Hubbards poetry was set to music on two additional albums: State of Mind and The Joy of Creating. Visitors to the Information Center can also learn more about Mr. Hubbard as a writer through the Scientology TV presentation L. Ron Hubbard: In His Own Voice: Life as an Author. This presentation is also available on demand. For more information about the presentation or the Information Center, please call 727-467-6966.

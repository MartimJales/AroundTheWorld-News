    "text": "Vadodara: It is commonplace to see pictures of deities pasted in staircases or tiles with photographs of gods and goddesses placed on walls or corners of staircases to discourage people from spitting there. But in Harni area of the city, pictures of Lord Ram have been put up with requests not to litter the road.There are several areas in the city that witness littering on the sides of the street as those residing or having businesses in nearby areas dump garbage there. The condition is worse in the internal areas in some parts of the city where street sweeping by the VMC is not frequent. The civic body swings into action only when it receives complaints.At one such intersection of two roads in Harni area, pictures of Lord Ram have been put up on signposts as the open space on the side of the road was littered. This was spotted by an activist who uses the road regularly. “The pictures have been put up for about 15 days now. The spot was used for dumping garbage for quite some time. Nobody knows who put up these signposts at the spot,” said activist Atul Gamechi. VMC’s assistant municipal commissioner of north zone, Mahipalsinh Jhala, said that the civic body did not put up such signposts. “We do put up signs warning against littering, but not pictures of deities. This may be the work of some residents,” Jhala said.Gamechi said that it was quite possible that a nearby society or a real estate developer put up the pictures. However, he observed that the move had not taken care of littering at the spot. “It still persists,” he said.

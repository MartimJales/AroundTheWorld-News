    "text": "After defending the truth of the literal bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ at length, the apostle Paul sang a deeply heartfelt hymn of rejoicing (1 Corinthians 15:54-57). This hymn was drawn from the prophets Isaiah and Hosea (Isaiah 25:8; Hosea 13:14). The Bible provides us with a multitude of profound reasons why we can also rejoice in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Following are seven reasons drawn from Scripture why all believers can be filled with joy as we celebrate Resurrection Day. - Vindication: The wrong treatment of Jesus by the Jewish and Roman courts was overturned when God vindicated his Son through resurrection by the Spirit (1 Timothy 3:16). The resurrection of Jesus from the dead is the supreme display of how it is in Godâ€™s very nature to overturn evil and establish justice. - Justification: Paul writes that Jesus was raised from the dead to justify believers (Romans 4:25). In other words, we can come into the presence of the divine throne of judgment and know that we will be declared righteous. We can be declared to be right, not because of who we are and what we have done, but because of who Jesus is and what he has done. - Transformation: Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we know that believers will also be physically raised from the dead. Indeed, all of creation is even now being fundamentally and permanently changed by the impact of his resurrection from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:20-27). - The End of Sin, Death, and Humiliation: Jesus Christ earned our salvation for us. However, to do so, the eternal Son of God first had to humble himself by becoming a human being. He then humbled himself even further by embracing death for us, for death is the penalty for our sin (Philippians 2:6-8). The good news is that he put an end to our sin, our death, and our humiliation. Through his cross, he overcame our sins and our death. And through his resurrection, he overcame both his humiliation and our humiliation (Philippians 2:9). - The Gift of the Holy Spirit: Jesus promised that he would give the Holy Spirit, the third Person of God the Holy Trinity, to indwell his followers (John 7:39). After he arose from the dead, he gave the Holy Spirit to bring forgiveness to those who believe in him and to empower their proclamation of his good news (John 20:21-23). The powerful working of the Holy Spirit also demonstrates that Jesus is Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). - Powerful Works: Jesus Christ promised his disciples that we might do even greater works than he did during his human ministry on earth. However, the only way we can do any good work on earth happens only when we ask Christ to do that work from his eternal throne (John 14:12-14). - Access to God: The resurrection of Jesus and his ascension to the right hand of the Father show that God has given Jesus Christ total rule over the present age and over the age to come (Ephesians 1:20-23). Brothers and sisters, we have direct relationship to the God-Man who rules on the very throne of heaven! And that means we never need to fear coming to God for forgiveness and restoration. I pray that these seven reasons will encourage you to rejoice in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead as you celebrate Easter this year! Oh, and do someone a favor and tell them why you are so happy!",

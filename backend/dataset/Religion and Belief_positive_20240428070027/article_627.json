May everyone find strength in the lessons of compassion and forgiveness it teaches us,\" the PM wrote on Twitter.\nChristians across the world observe Good Friday to commemorate the crucifixion of Christ.\nIt is observed during the Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday, and also Black Friday.\nToday, on Good Friday, we remember the profound sacrifice of Jesus Christ. May everyone find strength in the lessons of compassion and forgiveness it teaches us.— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)\n[March 29, 2024]\nHow is it celebrated in India?\nAt some places, people hold three-hour long special services at noon- it's the time when Jesus is believed to have been crucified.\nTo mourn the absence of God and the associated sadness, lights are dimmed and eventually extinguished. The followers are seen wearing black clothes and they cover all religious pictures, crosses and icons in their homes and also in the churches.\nDepicting the earthquake that struck during Jesus’ dying hour, a loud noise is created. The Holy Communion is held at some places.",

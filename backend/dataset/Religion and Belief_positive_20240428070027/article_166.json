    "text": "When I committed to Georgetown two years ago, I remember wondering how my Sikh-American identity would align with the school’s Jesuit values and identity. And yet, in these two years, I have found community, celebration, and solace in the Dharmic community at Georgetown University . Georgetown celebrates the religion and identities of many diverse faiths. A quintessential example of this was the Spring Fest celebration hosted by Dharmic Life this past weekend! Spring Fest is a joint celebration hosted by many organizations at Georgetown, including Dharmic Life, GU Hindu Student Association, Asian American Student Association, Sikh Student Association, Buddhist Student Association and Jain Student Association. These communities come together to celebrate their respective spring holidays while sharing their joy with other members of the larger Dharmic community. This year, we came together to celebrate Holi, Vaisakhi, Songkran, Yugadi, Mahavir Jayanti and Wesak. These holidays, although celebrated in different traditions, are known as “spring festivals” and celebrate the spring harvest in South Asia. My role in Spring Fest was to represent the Sikh Student Association and share a prayer with others, emphasizing the importance of growing as a person, alongside the growth of spring season. On behalf of the organization, I spoke about the importance of Vaisakhi, as it holds profound significance for Sikhs. Vaisakhi commemorates the formation of the Khalsa, the community of initiated Sikhs, by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. It marks a pivotal moment in Sikh history, symbolizing courage, sacrifice and the commitment to uphold principles of equality, justice and righteousness. Sikhs celebrate Vaisakhi with fervor, engaging in prayers, processions, communal meals (langar) and acts of service, reaffirming their faith and celebrating the spirit of unity and selflessness.",

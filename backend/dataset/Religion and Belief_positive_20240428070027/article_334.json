It is recounted that one day, while Amir al-Mo’menin, Al-Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him), was seated in the mosque with some of his companions, Zaid ibn Sohaan Abdi posed a question to Imam Ali (peace be upon him). Imam Ali (peace be upon him), known as the Gate of the City of Knowledge according to a saying of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), was approached for enlightenment by Zaid.\nHe asked: ‘O Amir al-Mo’menin (s)!

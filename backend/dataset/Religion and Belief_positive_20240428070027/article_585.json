    "text": "President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, along with his wife Rebecca, family, and on behalf of the government, has extended Easter greetings to all Ghanaians.\nThe president said that he hopes the Easter celebration will bestow healing upon the nation and purify it from all wrongdoings.\nPresident Akufo-Addo in his address noted that the celebration of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ should usher in a new season characterised by faith, hope, growth, prosperity, reconciliation, and sacrifice for everyone in Ghana and around the world.\nHe also emphasised the need for safety throughout the holiday season. He appealed to all to exercise caution while driving and to continuously hold the nation in their prayers.\nPresident Akufo-Addo further urged Ghanaians to take part in the various Easter activities, such as conventions, social gatherings, picnics, and the time-honoured Kwahu Easter celebrations, all while adhering to established safety measures.",

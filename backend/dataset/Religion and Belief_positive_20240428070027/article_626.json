    "text": "6 Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God. 7 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. When was the last time you bothered to stop, stoop and pick up a lost penny from the ground? To the person who dropped it, it wasn’t worth looking for. It’s hardly worth the risk of putting your back out to stoop over and pick it up. A trip to the chiropractor would cost much more than the value of the penny. Value is an odd thing to define. A penny, nickel, dime or quarter has hardly any value anymore. That dollar bill in your wallet is the new penny. The twenty? The new five. That “Benjamin”? The new fifty. Inflation is a hidden thief that robs value. It’s no big deal to become a “millionaire” anymore. On the other hand, a thin piece of cardboard smaller than a 3”x5” card sold for over two and a half million dollars. It happened to have the picture of Honus Wagner on it. Value is in the eye of the beholder. Jesus says that sparrows are valued at two cents apiece. But even they get the attention of God. This bring us eventually to the question; “What is your value?” What are you worth? I once read a story of a naval aviator who ditched his aircraft in the ocean in World War II. He was eventually captured by Indigenous people on an island. He was traded to others for a sack of rice. They valued this man as equal to a sack of rice. The gospels tell us the story of God sending His only Son to earth to pick up every lost penny as it were. Jesus even tells a story of the “Lost Coin” illustrating the lengths He goes to find everyone of us who is a lost coin. That was His mission. Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. Jesus asks us this question: Matthew 16:26 For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul? What would you be willing to give to save your life? Everything. Nothing is worth more than our very life. God values your life more than you do. He was willing to send His only Son to save you. He took your place on a cross He didn’t deserve to save us from death. Think of it! As we celebrate this weekend the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, it reminds us that we are of great worth to the One who created us. We owe Him everything, even our very lives for stooping down, picking us up and affirming that we do in fact, have value. John 3:16 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. The world will sometimes treat us like we have little value. God never will. Your life is of great value to Him. Why not put your trust in someone who places such great value on you? Rev.

    "text": "Charles Edward (Charlie) Hall was a man of God. Every job, every person, everywhere was his Church.\nCharlie passed away on March 22, 2024, just 9 days short of his 90th Birthday.\nCharlie was born on March 31, 1934 in Huntsville, TX. The piney woods of East Texas stayed in his veins and his life throughout. His \"place of power\" was the front porch of the family cabin overlooking Club Lake just outside of Huntsville. \"Every meaningful decision I have ever made in my life occurred at Club Lake,\" Charlie was fond of saying.\nBorn to Clyde Ernest and Odell Lela Weatherly Hall, Charlie grew up around the family lumber yard business. He graduated from Huntsville, HS in 1951. He then proceeded to Lon Morris Methodist College before graduating from Southwestern University. He later attended the Perkins School of Theology at SMU and was ordained an Elder in the United Methodist Church in 1961. After several years of full-time ministry, Charlie joined Sears Roebuck in Houston and held numerous management positions throughout a 23-year career with Sears. He finished his business career with TelTex Computer sales.\nCharlie and his wife, Joy, raised their family in West University. They joined West University United Methodist Church in 1976 and Charlie served in many volunteer and part-time capacities before joining the staff full-time in 1996. One of Charlie's great joys and gifts was marriage counseling and performing weddings for young couples. He was similarly gifted in hospital ministry and senior care. Young and old, Charlie connected with anyone that he could help place in the path of God.\nCharlie always had a special place in his heart for the underdog, the lost, the lonely and the least of us. He was generous with his time, talents and treasures and loved to connect people in his many circles. In addition to his church, he supported KUHF radio, Medical Bridges, Doctors without Borders, Amazing Place and the Christian Community Service Center. He also served on the board of West University Little League, twice serving as its President.\nCharlie is survived by his wife of 62 years, Joy Johnson Hall and his 3 sons and their families:\nDude and Christy Hall of Montgomery and their children Clayton (wife Leigh and children Catherine and Carter), Chase (wife Ali) Caleb and Caroline (husband Sam).\nDoug and Sue Ellen Hall of Manvel and their children Allison (husband Matt) Drew (wife Laura and daughter Ellison) Morgan and Zachary.\nDavid Hunter and wife Shelly of Covington, GA and their children Jackson, Steadman, Holden and Lauren Joy.\nThe family wishes to thank the incredible staffs at Houston Hospice, Amazing Place, a community for families with dementia, and the Villas of SCR at the Heights.\nServices will be held at West University United Methodist Church and include a visitation from 5:30 - 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 2, 2024 in the Chapel and a funeral service on Wednesday, April 3, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in the sanctuary. Also on April 3, a graveside service will be held at 3:30 p.m. at Old Oakwood Cemetery, Avenue H and 9th Street, Huntsville, TX 77320 with a private reception to follow.\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be sent on Charlie's behalf to West U Methodist Stephen's Ministry, Amazing Place, Caring Friends, the Christian Community Service Center or a charity of your choice.

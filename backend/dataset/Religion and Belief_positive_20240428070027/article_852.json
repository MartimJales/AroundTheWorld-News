    "text": "Since the 80s, one of the largest Stations of the Cross in Bogotá has been held in the town of Ciudad Bolívar, south of the city, every Good Friday during Holy Week. This is the journey of thousands of people to the Tree of Life, located in the afternoon of this town in the Potosí sector.\nIf you are going to participate in the tour this year, keep the following recommendations in mind:\nAvoid participating in the company of children under 5 years of age and pets. Maintain good hydration, sunscreen and clothing that covers well. The consumption of alcoholic beverages and psychoactive substances is prohibited. Follow the recommendations of the organizers within the framework of the event. Avoid separating from the main mobilization. Do not throw any type of garbage during the procession or on the grounds of the Tree of Life. Inform the authorities of any risky or special situation. Here, a post with more information and recommendations from the Local Mayor’s Office of Ciudad Bolívar about the Way of the Cross to the Tree of Life, this Friday, March 29, 2024:\nAccording to estimates from the ecclesiastical authority of Colombia, it is expected that the traditional Stations of the Cross in town 19 will become the largest in the entire city above the best-known ones in the capital district such as those in Barrio 20 de Julio and Monserrate.\nDue to the above, the district authorities have established a Unified Command Post (PMU) to guarantee security and carry out preventive measures. This event will be accompanied by volunteers from the Red Cross, the Colombian Civil Defense, two ambulances, human rights managers and the Local Mayor’s Office of Ciudad Bolívar.\nTo guarantee surveillance and security, there will be support from the National Police, the National Army, security and coexistence managers from the District Security Secretariat, managers from the local mayor’s office, Community Police and Tourism Police.\nLikewise, the Ministry of Mobility and the Traffic Police will be in charge of road closures and detours for this Good Friday in the Santa Viviana, Potosí, Caracolí and Arborizadora Alta neighborhoods. The SITP routes and other public service vehicles will have adjustments to their routes during the pilgrimage.\nThe closures will begin at 7:00 am and will go until 2:00 pm from the Candelaria La Nueva neighborhood to the upper part of the town along Carrera 42 Avenue between Calle 68c Sur and Diagonal 81 Sur.\nBelow is a map with the closures during the day:\nIf you are interested in attending the Stations of the Cross this Friday, March 29, these are the stations:\nStart time 7:00 am\n1 Station:\n• Location Our Lady of Candelaria Parish (Cra 35 con calle 64)\n2 Station:\n• Place Cl. 68c South #41-5 to 41-1\n3 Station:\n• Lugar Cra. 38 #69g Sur-19 to 69g Sur-49\n4 Station:\n• Location CL 69D South – KR 39\n5 Station:\n• Lugar Cl. 69m Sur #44a-2 a 44a-44\n6 Station:\n• Lugar Cra. 42 #69n Sur-45 to 69n Sur-81\n7 Station:\n• Place Cra. 42 #71 Sur-1 to 71 Sur-69\n8 Station:\n• Lugar Cra. 42 #72b Sur-14 to 72b Sur-10\n9 Station:\n• Location Cra. 42 #73b South-88 to 73b South-2\n10 Station:\n• Location Cl. 75b South #42 to 41\n11 Station:\n• Place Cl. 78a South #38-2 at 38-94\n12 Station:\n• TV Place. 37 #79 South-3 to 79 South-67\n13 Station:\n• Lugar Tv. 37 #78b Sur-42 to 78b Sur-2\n14 Station:\n• Place of the hanged man or Tree of Life .",

    "text": "Our special guest is none other than John James, the former lead singer and co-founder of the Christian rock band The Newsboys. John shares his inspiring journey from Australia to the United States over 35 years ago with his band, and how they overcame adversity, including being high school dropouts from broken families. But beyond music, John and his wife Tanya work with individuals struggling with addictions and are involved in the Army's Spiritual Resilience Program. They emphasize the importance of a healthy body, mind, soul, and spirituality. Join us as we dive into John's story of resilience, hard work, and surrounding oneself with positive influences.

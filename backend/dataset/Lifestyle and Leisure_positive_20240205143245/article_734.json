Your generosity smashed all previous fundraising records, raising $7450.21!\nRationalWiki:Chicken coop/Archive132\n[Jump to navigation](#mw-head) [Jump to search](#searchInput)\nGrammarCommie and 2friedeggs\nBoth users are terminally unable to resolve a conflict despite multiple interactions and chances,\n[[1]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs#Inciting_incident and their interactions have led them being handled on ATIM several times. [[2]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive58 [[3]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive57 [[4]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive55 I've tried stepping in and giving advice, though this is ineffective, with 2friedeggs continuing to prod GC (while 2friedeggs has had a very rocky history with interacting with other users in the wiki) while GC has continued acting incivil and assumed bad faith in me and baselessly accused me of dishonesty (while also lashing out at other users). Their disruptive actions are not conductive to the site, and discussion is needed to deal with both of them. --It's-a me, [Lefty](/wiki/User:LeftyGreenMario) [Green](/wiki/User_talk:LeftyGreenMario) [Mario](/wiki/Special:Contributions/LeftyGreenMario)!( [Mod](/wiki/RationalWiki:Moderators)) 03:09, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- The reason I kept talking to GC is because from my end it looks like people like to turn a blind eye to the way he talks to other people. I have been called out for flaming in the past (playful language, like \"dingledorf\"), which I have ceased when I was. This guy routinely does it in bad faith, with much harsher language, and does not even cease when asked to stop, and assumes everyone is out to get him in the occasions he realizes he might have to face consequences, like now. A banned user has given me a theory of why he gets away with it and to say the least it's one I do not agree with at all. I've already mentioned on ATIM I'm ok with an iban. Generally speaking a couple of people on here I wont mention by name have been hostile to me in the past which might explain the rocky history, but yes I have blood on my hands so to speak.--\n[2friedeggs](/wiki/User:2friedeggs)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs)) 03:16, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- I would support an interaction ban as well. We have all the proof needed to say eggs and GC can't resolve their differences via discussion. Neither of them will de-escalate on their own.-\n[Flandres](/wiki/User:Flandres)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Flandres)) 03:38, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- It's almost 11 PM. I'm tired, I've had multiple anxiety attacks (unrelated to this drama), I'm depressed, I'm annoyed, and I really don't have the energy to fight over this crap, on this site, any further. I left of my own volition, and honestly, I don't know why I even responded to LGM's comments, since in hindsight they were just... I don't even know what. 2friedeggs can go fuck himself though, given he started this crap. Do what you feel needs to be done. I'm beat.\n[☭Comrade GC☭](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)03:53, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Nope but I do also call attention to their history. Both of them have been at the core of multiple disputes with multiple users, so they're both looking like problem users on their own. I'll do a rundown later, but 2friedeggs does seem tiresome to moderate while GC has been slinging insults at everyone in the community and has now twice accused me of dishonesty, the second time\n[[5]]https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation&diff=prev&oldid=2467379being a passive-aggressive insinuation of insidious motives from me, accusations I do not take lightly and should not be within spirit of discourse for this wiki. Not to mention his swipes at the community at large. One example: Block logon Let Them Eat Cake while I was going through the ATIM process because that's how we normally handle trolls on the wiki, through getting opinion of the mob: (\"You people are idiots.\"). Second example: [[6]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:Log/GrammarCommie(\"I quit. Rot in hell\".) Third example: unwarranted attack on the moderators while also regularly contributing to disruption [[7]]https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vortex&diff=prev&oldid=2455474\"Obviously someone needs to keep some level of order around here, and it sure as shit isn't the Mods or yourself.\" It's going to continue. It doesn't matter to me \"who started\", they're both problems.\n- I'm not particularly sympathetic to your personal issues either, GC, not much anymore, especially after your graphic all-caps remarks in spite of my pleas to stop through discord dms and block logs, and your horrible personal attacks on me, but you're letting it spill over on this site a few too many times and I'm still going to say you need a ton of self-control and improvement on your end. I don't like how this all soured, I don't like cooping you at all, but I care about the community too. --It's-a me,\n[Lefty](/wiki/User:LeftyGreenMario) [Green](/wiki/User_talk:LeftyGreenMario) [Mario](/wiki/Special:Contributions/LeftyGreenMario)!( [Mod](/wiki/RationalWiki:Moderators)) 04:07, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- GrammarCommie has been complained about multiple recent times at ATIM, and was nearly blocked recently\n[[8]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive54but Plutocow and 2friedeggs were recently ibanned, suggesting it could be more on Eggs then GC, as weird as that feels to say [[9]]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation/Archive57#Votes_for_Plutocow_and_2friedeggs, where GC was also being hyper-aggressive. [Andrew5](/wiki/User:Andrew5)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Andrew5)) 11:04, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- If a recent iban of all things makes it more on me fine just end this, resysop me, and iban me from him so that I don't enable his stage-like drama any longer, it'll be good for both of us.--\n[2friedeggs](/wiki/User:2friedeggs)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs)) 11:35, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Full support behind IBAN. In addition, I'd soft propose a sysoprevoke on 2friedeggs. I don't have a concrete policy reason for this, but their behavior over the past few months illustrates a clear lack of baseline competence to be able to manage anything more than a potted plant (much less a wiki). --\n[Techpriest](/wiki/User:Techpriest)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Techpriest)) 11:36, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- It can be hard to stay calm sometimes, but that seems to be the expectation in the world over. Since GC already quit, it's just a matter of giving infractions like anyone else if they're in clear violation of site rules. I haven't been paying enough attention to eggs to say much. Basically, if you stop to think for a minute whether your comment is actually worth posting over going for a walk or playing a game and saying \"okay fuck that noise\" for a while, avoiding the conflict tends to work out better. It also tends to work out better for you because the person you are pissed at will tend to get themselves in trouble more when you don't respond. Basically, just don't fight people. There is no pride to be won in an internet argument. This comes from frankly too damned much experience on that issue.\n[BumblingBuffoon](/wiki/User:BumblingBuffoon)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:BumblingBuffoon)) 11:44, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- It can be hard to stay calm sometimes, but that seems to be the expectation in the world over.

I don't have a concrete policy reason for this, but their behavior over the past few months illustrates a clear lack of baseline competence to be able to manage anything more than a potted plant (much less a wiki). --\n- Sysop revoke for GC for long-standing incivility and longstanding misuse of sysop revoke functions (randomly doing it without going to ATIM, and unecessarily), editing of other people's comments, threatening behaviour, and goading of other editors. Also re-sysop for 2fried if GC or a Discord buddy of them once again desysopped 2fried. GC is also not an active or contributing member, and has stated, for multiple reasons, he will no longer want to be contribing to various talk pages and saloon bar discussions, so an iban makes no sense. His only presence is on a Discord room that appears to be totally defunct, and so the only people who will defend him are fellow Discord mods. I have not encountered any issues from 2fried but once shared with him that I experienced similar issues with GC. 2fried also seems to be a very active contributing member to mainspace, and with a lack of history of incivility on his end, I see no reason to have this ATIM blow back on him. Now leftygreen is also experiencing unecessary drama from GC. Basta, it's enough\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 11:51, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Should the topic of GC's incivility, goading, editing of other people's comments, threatening behaviour, and inability to get along with bread and butter editors once again grace the coop, where they try to resign or bow out before more comments, and who's only contributions to the wiki have been spam cleaning and talk page drama over years now, would propose an idef ban on GC.\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 12:24, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- If a recent iban of all things makes it more on me fine just end this, resysop me, and iban me from him so that I don't enable his stage-like drama any longer, it'll be good for both of us.--\n- GrammarCommie has been complained about multiple recent times at ATIM, and was nearly blocked recently\n- Nope but I do also call attention to their history.

I support a sysoprevoke on GC.\n[Andrew5 mobile](/wiki/User:Andrew5_mobile) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Andrew5_mobile)) 13:41, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Someone informed me GC desysopped 2fried against sysop rules, and without consultation with the community. I have resysopped 2fried as it was not in consultation with the community. I don't know much about 2fried's talk page history, but I have not seen any abusive behaviour from him, including misuse of sysop, and his mainspace edits are good. Should this coop vote to desysop 2fried I'd respect the decision, but right now the coop is leaning in favor of dysopping GC and perhaps an iban btw 2\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 14:04, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Current thoughts: I wondered for awhile how my little comment on GC's page, a little critique spiralled into a coop issue and really he sysoprevoke me because I banned him and disabled talk page privileges for harassment. That right there was not cool in hind sight and was because he kept reverting my criticism of him while name-calling me at the same time. But I probably should have been patient. The mods sure seem to be and perhaps they know something about GC that makes them try to be patient with him. GC is not shy from bringing his mental health up. I don't know GC well.\n- I wanna make one thing clear: GC has likely stopped many a spammer. He's a wonder at that, that's for sure. The problem is for some reason he's a little too aggressive doing it. I do wonder how many people who could've been productive editors we're chased off by him though. I want him to keep his mop if he can learn to manage his anger. I don't want him to chase off editors over trivial matters and flame people into intimidation. I don't want him to turn to theatrics when he is not getting his way.--\n[2friedeggs](/wiki/User:2friedeggs)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs)) 14:14, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Oxyaena before she left informed me that GC's manipulative behaviour was partially a reason for her leave. Or maybe it was after she left I don't really remember. There is no reason this should even be a coop but once again GC has made people obsess over him. Some form of permanent desysop would be in order, as last time he was dysopped he got someone to resysop him almost as soon as he asked. Leftymario asked GC to stop teasing his permanent leave, and either leave or come back and not start fights, and he chose to 1. come back and 2. start a fight immediately and 3. break another sysop rule by desysopping a good contributor without community consultation.\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 14:19, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Oxyaena was banned by the community after causing continuous strife, engaging in endless LANCB's and getting more interaction bans than any other member of the community ever. Whatever may be happening with currently with other individuals the main person responsible for her behavior and departure was her.\n[Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"Life is short and (insert adjective)\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)14:49, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- LMAO. Oxyaena was herself a manipulative psychopath who would block IP editors (including myself back in the day) claiming to have a hunch that said IP editor was a sockpuppet whatever troll she had an obsession with at the moment and cry \"YOU HATE ME!\" like\nwp:Nancy Olesonon Little House on the Prairie)whenever someone would call her out for it. She is a big reason why I registered this account, and boy it feels good to call a spade a spade right now and NOT worry about it creating a shitfest because, frankly, watching everybody come to her defense whenever someone who wasn't an established user called her out was pathetic.

Making him unable to revert his self-ban until he asks to be unbanned\n- Seeing though I'm partially accountable though it seems I feel a little weird talking like this--\n[2friedeggs](/wiki/User:2friedeggs)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs)) 14:29, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- People will decide on what is warranted, they don't need instructions on what to do. Also unrelated, in my coop comment, I addressed that I had once accepted a request to comment on the matter from 2fried via his dicosrd account weeks ago. That the only person defending GC in the coop is also in contact with GC on Discord is not a reason to bring that to people's talk pages. I did not ask anyone to start the current atim or coop. that people are elevating discord drama I am not involved in or interested in to my talk page is not wanted, please do not do that. That the current coop and atim were started without my involvement, means that I am just giving my opinion, along with Leftymario and Andrew. I have never been in contact with Leftymario or Andrew but agree with them here.\n[Neiltyson1fan](/wiki/User:Neiltyson1fan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Neiltyson1fan)) 14:43, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- I'll see what I can do via DMs.\n[HendrickTheGross](/wiki/User:HendrickTheGross)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:HendrickTheGross)) 14:45, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- I'll see what I can do via DMs.\n- People will decide on what is warranted, they don't need instructions on what to do.

The issue with GC is really one with toxic masculinity, honestly...constantly yelling and jeering at everyone he does not like, then going into horrible detail about self-harm in order to scare people into silence. Quite abusive behavior.--\n[April](/wiki/User:AprilIsTrying) [Chat?](/wiki/User_talk:AprilIsTrying)15:43, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- Leave my self harm issues out of it.

He restores his comment again. 01:20, 5 July 2022 I take his mop. He starts an ATIM case to complain.\n- Bear in mind that at this point he has engaged in goading, which I have logs for him engaging in during my initial quitting of the site.\n\"Never Change man\" He's a liar when he says he just wants me to be better behaved. That is a lie. He wants me to lash out so he can have an excuse to bar me from the site.

If so, stop accusing anyone of bias.\nTime for cooler heads to prevail\nPreface: Because of the sheer amounts of HCM on display, I will not put up with any slapfighting in the replies to this section. That is to say, I am throwing a mod fiat and any slapfighting will be moved under a collapse. If you don't like it, further complaining\nwill result in beatings until the morale improves may lead to short term blocks.\nOkay so first. Let's unpack this situation instead of just commenting on it during work breaks (me). For some reason everyone is exploring the full range of potential that HCM holds and isn't posting any logs until GC did so a bit earlier. Let's walk through those and try to build a timeline.\nTimeline of events (timestamps are in my timezone - they're still chronological, which is what matters):\n- 16 June 2022: GC bans himself from the wiki alongside temporarily banning 2friedeggs. Events prior to this and the leadup to this LANCB will not be considered for this timeline, mostly because we need to cap this timeline off somewhere.\n- 1 July 2022: GC shortly unbans himself to remove an old essay made on the site. He reblocks himself immediately after.\n- 3 July 2022:\n- Let Them Eat Cake (LETC) is reported to All Things In Moderation by LeftyGreenMario for transphobic trolling.\n- 16:20 GC unbans himself, indefinitely blocks LTEC (16:30), and blocks himself again immediately after (16:31).\n- 20:59 LGM makes\nthis commenton GCs talkpage, to attempt to resolve the initial events that led to LANCB of GC (afaict).\n- 4 July 2022:\n- 00:24 GC replies\nwith this commentand LGM replies again(00:26).\n- 01:30 2friedeggs replies\nwith this inflammatory comment.\n- 13:54\nGC reverts 2friedeggs commentand responds to LGM(13:54-14:10, 3 edits, cut down for brevity's sake).\n- 00:24 GC replies\n- 5 July 2022:\n- 02:35 2friedeggs and GC edit war over the aforementioned inflammatory comment (edit war is at 03:05, 03:08).\n- 03:08 2friedeggs blocks GC with talkpage access disabled (this is the first instance of user rights being abused).\n- 03:20 GC unblocks himself, blocks 2friedeggs and strips him of rights (alongside two alts of 2friedeggs).\n- 03:22 2friedeggs files an\nATIM case against GC, citing privilege abuse. This slaps back and forth until this coop case is opened.\n- 03:23 2friedeggs reports to GC that he's been posted on ATIM\nwith a new inflammatory comment.\n- 03:49 LGM replies to the resolution thread\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrammarCommie&diff=2467368&oldid=2467341. GC responds again telling LGM to not interact with him anymore.\n- 05:01 LGM gives GC a 9 hour block (talkpage access enabled)\n- 05:07 LGM tells GC that he's\nin the coop.\n- 05:11 LGM unblocks GC.\n- 05:58 GC blocks himself.\n- 16:46 GC unblocks himself to respond to the coop.\nI've omitted the details of the ATIM case, you can observe the last revision of that\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki_talk:All_things_in_moderation&oldid=2467428.\nThese are the facts of the current coop.\nNow for some opinions of mine:\nFirst, while I prior softly threw up boomeranging 2friedeggs' sysop abuse for gross incompetence, I think this should be acted upon even further. 2friedeggs is blatantly incapable of acting with any responsibility whatsoever and I frankly think that he should be permanently banned for excessive inflammatory behavior (he has a history of this, see\narchive 53, archive 55 and archive 57, plus he has an outstanding interaction ban with Plutocow for similar inflammatory/straight up annoying behavior when it comes to disagreements with others).\nSecondly there is the matter of GC. It's... not exactly a secret that GC responds poorly to people badgering him or when he gets aggravated (which happens easily) and because he's a prolific editor, he attracts a lot of people that badger him. We've slapped GC on the wrist before for crossing the lines into what he's said and as far as I can currently assume, the self-exile was a decision made to prevent this from getting out of hand. That being said, having a lot of cases made against you is not necessarily grounds in and of itself for removal from the site. While frustrating the entire site on a regular basis is a good way to get shorttracked into a ban, GC largely doesn't do this; it's invariably editors who themselves have issues. That isn't to say GC is entirely clean, but for this case, I cannot in good conscience recommend punishing GC. Outside of the timeline, it should be noted that GCs original LANCB\n[was triggered over a conflict with 2friedeggs](/wiki/User_talk:2friedeggs#Inciting_incident).\nThirdly, we need to address neiltyson1fan and like... actually do it properly. He really almost warrants his own section for how much he's climbed on the chair to accuse GC of being a bad faith actor. For some history; neiltyson1fan originally ragequit the site because of attempted ownership of the\n[Incel](/wiki/Incel) page, which he kept whitewashed to promote a wiki which he has a COI with for several years. You can read this pretty much entirely on [the first archive for that page](/wiki/Talk:Incel/Archive1#Neiltyson1fan_promotes_his_own_wiki_and_websites_here_while_deleting_competing_websites). There's a lot of other problems with neiltyson1fan as well, such as attempting ownership of the [MMT](/wiki/MMT) page (which he got so annoyed with that he copy-pasted the entire page into his [userspace](/w/index.php?title=User:Neiltyson1fan/Nice_version_of_MMT_page&action=edit&redlink=1)), and mind you that this is all over a mere disagreement on page content. He eventually completely ragequit the site after GC crossed a line when it came to being aggravated (which got handled appropriately at the time by on-site staff and led to some words about GC not posting about self-harm in the bar anymore).\nI will also note that, and this is frankly far more disgusting (although I had forgotten about this), neiltyson1fan's disagreements with me being a \"bad moderator\" come from the fact that he tried to go sysop shopping off-site to get GC banned during that event where he (neiltyson1fan) ragequit (or in his phrasing: \"make friends\"), part of which involved sending me and some other users some frankly really creepy messages in retrospect (amongst other things telling me that \"i want to connect with you on a personal level\", when I told him that I was a mod and was doing my duties as a mod). I'd not follow up too much on this at the time as I had IRL issues that largely prevented me from interacting with the site.\nBecause of all this, as well as his current inflammatory behavior in the coup, I am recommending an indefinite ban for neiltyson1fan as well for editor harassment, inability to resolve arguments peacefully and attempting to badger other editors into making bad decisions.\nI would like to remind anyone who made it this far that the previous mod fiat is in effect and slapfighting will all be thrown together under a general collapse. --\n[Techpriest](/wiki/User:Techpriest) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Techpriest)) 17:32, 5 July 2022 (UTC)\n- You got the\neventsa little wrongthere, he could've unblocked himself to do something else too but he decided to actually permablock me, not temp block me.

LGM blocked both of us so he could coop us then unblocked us for the coop My \"inflammatory comment\" was telling GC he needs a break if he can't find a reason to contribute. When LGM told GC to take it easy he asked LGM to never contact him again. I do suspect some bias due to GC's status on the wiki which I accepted long ago but this is particularly egregious. I don't care about GC anymore since I realized he's likely on edge because of Neilty harassing him for months now. Personally I feel caught up in that now. But if you're going to find a reason to ban me do it right and without omitting things please.

Anyway, I mostly looked into this from the perspective of what actually occured as an inciting incident, hence why I've left some things out. I sorta assumed that was the reason why GC got a short block; LGM usually doesn't block people out of mere anger. I don't really think there's a reason to ban you anymore, sysoprevoke is still something I'd recommend. I consider the comment inflammatory because it's basically telling a person who left the site in an attempt to not get angry at you that he can better stay away.

And that is the topic of the coop you are still not addressing. Gross.\n- Fun fact about your whole persecution complex, but uh 2friedeggs will likely be fine outside of a sysoprevoke (which he may not even end up getting). He's admitted that his behavior was past the mark of acceptability and that it may have launched a shitstorm he did not intent and is actually receptive to improving his behavior. You meanwhile have basically from the start been crowing on and on about how corrupt the site is. Like, c'mon man, look at what you're doing here in this section. You're citing a situation that GC literally apologized for doing (which was handled prior) as proof that he should be banned.

As the subject of the coop is about GCs abuse of moderatorship (and direct abuse of other people) and you keep trying to deflect and keep voting him to stay in power. So that's why I would rather not talk to you.\n- I should be clear that none of this actually addresses the reasons why I think you should be indefinietly banned and you've so far never actually engaged with that part. --\n- What's with this Discord stuff? Is there a server I'm not aware of, because people hardly use the support chat or the saloon one.\n[Chef Moosolini’s Ristorante Italiano](/wiki/User:DuceMoosolini) [Make a Reservation](/wiki/User_talk:DuceMoosolini)01:08, 6 July 2022 (UTC)\n- @\n[DuceMoosolini](/wiki/User:DuceMoosolini)Neiltyson1fan accused me of conspiring in DMs, then in the support chat, then it was the fact that I'm staff in the support chat, now it's that people are defending me at all, even in the most minor way. Frankly, I'm shocked at this level of obsession from someone I barely care about. [☭Comrade GC☭](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)01:48, 6 July 2022 (UTC)\n- @\n- If GC mods the support discord and gets off the hook every time from people in that discord, of course it's relevant. I'm just an editor with my own wikis, it doesn't matter what happens to me on RW, what matters is how corruption occurs at RW.\nTechpriest has diligently summarised everything well\nThis summary makes sense and his proposal for dealing with GC, eggs and neilty are sensible. Much of the rest here is predictable noise (especially the serial commentators and the dubious defence so far).

The sole reason it even became relevant is because you went screeching straight out of the gate that it's a cabal that defends GC at all costs. (Which uh, no, it's really not.

Anyone just needs to go through the edit history of techpriest and GC to know the former is a wikilawyer who does not actually do anything that great for the wiki, and the latter an abuser For now, I will scramble my password as moderatorship has shown they do not want to abide by RWs commitment to not indeffing users who were in good standing before interjecting in a coop. I will return in a few years after this coalition inevitably falls due to harbouring at least one abuser of editors.

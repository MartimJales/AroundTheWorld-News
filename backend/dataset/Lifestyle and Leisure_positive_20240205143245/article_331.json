    "text": "Technically, you can buy this rally-spec Toyota GR Yaris race car\nWe’ve heard a lot of people say that the Toyota GR Yaris is a rally car for the road. In some ways, we agree with that sentiment as it has all the ingredients that make it so.\nWith its all-wheel drive, smart differential, and a boosted engine, the GR Yaris can be a weapon on the circuit and on rally stages. However, if you want the one that’s being used for the World Rally Championship, you can’t exactly show up to your nearest Toyota dealership and get one.\nOTHER STORIES YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED:\n5 JDM legends that turn 25 in ’24\nPenalties from anti-colorum ops amounted to a whopping P20.8-M in December 2023 alone\nToyota GR Yaris Rally2 side view\nPHOTO BY Toyota\nIt doesn’t mean you can’t buy the rally-spec car. Provided you have deep pockets, there’s the Toyota GR Yaris Rally2 racer. What is it, you ask? It’s essentially a ‘milder’ version of the WRC version that’s made for privateers and customer racing teams.\nThe GR Yaris Rally2 is as close as you can get to Kalle Rovanperä’s Rally1 car. Rally2 cars don’t pack as much power and torque as the Rally1 racers with engines limited to 285hp (Rally1 cars have close to 500hp). These cars also don’t have the Rally1 car’s hybrid system and e-boost.\nToyota GR Yaris Rally2 shakedown\nPHOTO BY Toyota\nStill, the specs are impressive. It uses the same engine block as the road-going model, but its 1.6-liter, turbocharged three-cylinder gets further reinforcements to handle the extra power and torque. Unlike the road car, this one uses a five-speed sequential transmission.\nHelping it turn in quicker is a mechanical limited slip differential. The massive 300mm brake rotors (355mm for tarmac stages) take care of shaving off speed.\nToyota GR Yaris Rally2 front view\nPHOTO BY Toyota\nHow much is it; you ask? Toyota isn’t mentioning any prices. However, most Rally2 race cars appear to hover around the €200,000 mark, approximately P12,500,000 at current conversion costs. It ain’t cheap, but it’s a lot less compared to the Rally1 cars that easily cost over twice as much.",

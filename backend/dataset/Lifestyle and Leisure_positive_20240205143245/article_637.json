    "text": "How to Create Faux Grass Cloth Walls Create the timeless look of a grass cloth wall treatment using this simple paint-and-brush technique to simulate the real thing — at a fraction of the cost. Grass cloth has been used as wallcoverings in Asian homes dating back as far as the first century. Traditional grass cloth was made of natural materials such as silks, grasses, bamboo and hemp. Because of its unique texture and history, grass cloth stands apart as both organic and luxurious. Grass cloth wallpaper is timeless and never goes out of style. It is again growing in popularity as a way to add texture and dimension to a room or feature wall. Its downside is that it is expensive to purchase, difficult to clean and requires a degree of skill to install properly. However, using standard wall paint, glaze and a special brush, you can mimic the look and create the upscale organic vibes of traditional grass cloth, with the added bonus of being able to choose any color. Tools and Materials: - paint - paint roller [clear mixing glaze](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Valspar-Clear-Satin-Water-based-Clear-Glaze/1000380325) [weaver brush](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Marshalltown/5003418901?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-lwn-_-ggl-_-PLA_LWN_127_Cleaning-_-5003418901-_-online-_-0-_-0&gclid=CjwKCAjwv8qkBhAnEiwAkY-ahjANGcFg4JkbqkWawej2mrSYLycjvJHtolaHdbwy04m1JFFLHZVqAxoCKEEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - painter’s tape - measuring tape - level 1. Mix the Paint Pour clear mixing glaze into paint at a ratio of two parts paint to one part glaze. Stir well. 2. Divide Wall Into Sections Painted grass cloth walls mimic the look of wallpaper, so first divide the wall into 3-foot (or even) sections. Use a measuring tape and a level to mark vertical lines. You will be working one section at a time and will be painting every other section. Apply painter’s tape to the outside of each mark based on the sections you will be painting first. 3. Paint Use a standard paint roller to apply paint to the wall. Work quickly and do not allow the paint to dry. Cover the entire first section to the painter’s tape. 4. Brush Wall Grab your weaver brush. Hold the brush vertically at the upper left-hand corner of the section and drag the brush horizontally across the paint, creating fine lines. Use a steady, slightly firm pressure. Repeat this motion down the entire height of the wall, overlapping each row slightly over the row above. Then, starting in the upper left-hand corner again, hold the brush horizontally and drag down the length of the wall. Work across the wall, again slightly overlapping each row. 5. Repeat the Process Skip one section and repeat the entire process in the third section. Work from the upper left to the lower right on this section as well. Let painted sections dry overnight. 6. Paint Skipped Sections Gently remove the painter’s tape and ensure the paint is completely dry. Apply painter’s tape just over the painted edge (if the paint has not dried completely, you risk the tape pulling the paint from the wall.) Repeat the painting process. Let dry completely before removing the tape. 7. Admire Your New Walls Elevating your style with added texture doesn’t have to be difficult and this simple project proves it. Grass cloth adds a unique, organic vibe to any space with only small investments of both time and money. Jennie Andrews Jennie Andrews",

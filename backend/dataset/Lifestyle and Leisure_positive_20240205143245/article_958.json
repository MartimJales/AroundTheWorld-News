    "text": "zero proof habits Stay sober, not somber, this Dry January with 11 non-alcoholic alternatives Not all New Year's resolutions need to be year-long. Some opt for a habit change that lasts just a month, but the habits learned can continue longer depending on preference. \"Dry January\" is one of the most popular of these month-long challenges, where folks choose to spend their first 31 days of the new year without any alcohol. Some participate to be more mindful, while some just want to give their bodies [a break](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/well/eat/dry-january-health-benefits.html). Many local bars, restaurants, and retailers are shifting their offerings to include more options for sober folks this time of year, and there are plenty of other activities to partake in around Austin that don't involve drinking at all. Whether its your first year trying Dry January or your fifth, here are 11 ways to stick to your alcohol-free goals around Austin. Dry spirits shopping and activities [Dear Dry Drinkery](https://www.deardrydrinkery.com/) Come for the NA drinks, stay for the sober community-building. The city's \" [first non-alcoholic bottle shop](https://austin.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/dear-dry-drinkery-dry-january/)\" – self-claimed by the newly-opened Dear Dry Drinkery in East Austin – is rallying behind its mission to create a judgement-free environment for guests to browse their rows of NA beverages throughout the year. The shop is hosting several educational classes and events to help Austinites blossom with healthier living habits, including a vision board party on Thursday, January 18; a full moon energy healing session on Thursday, January 25; and a fun craft-and-chill hour on Sunday, January 28. [Tiny Grocer](https://tinygrocer.com/) This food market in Hyde Park and South Congress specializes in providing shoppers with locally produced, organic products and housewares, which also includes nonalcoholic beverages. Owner Steph Steele shared her picks for her favorite (locally made) nonalcoholic drinks that Austinites can find on Tiny Grocer shelves, including [Surely](https://www.drinksurely.com/) wine and [Slow Luck Non-Alcholic Spirits](https://slowluckbev.com/). If you're interested in browsing an extra large selection of offerings, Tiny Grocer's Hyde Park location is the place to be, and you can stick around to grab a seat at the shop's in-house French restaurant, [Bureau de Poste](https://bureaudeposteatx.com/), which also offers many NA options on their drink menu. [Free community fitness and wellness classes by Swift Fit Events](https://www.swiftfitevents.com/community-events)Instead of brunch and Bloody Marys, Swift Fit has replaced your weekend routine at no cost. It’s not a studio promotion; Swift Fit is always free, and caters to all levels. These classes could keep someone busy nearly every day of the week (sans Wednesdays), at Republic Square Park, Boggy Creek Farm, Swift's own downtown headquarters, and more. In the spirit of Dry January, consider stopping by for yoga at Fareground on Sundays and Mondays, where you can stick around for lunch by one of several food hall-style vendors. [Museum of Ice Cream](https://www.museumoficecream.com/austin/) Okay, so meeting up for a drink is canceled. There's always time for ice cream, and if you hang around The Domain in North Austin, consider stopping by the Museum of Ice Cream to explore all of their frosty and creamy creations. It's a great way to engage with your inner child, enjoying the museum's immersive installations while indulging in unlimited ice cream. Tickets (general admission begins at $21) can be purchased online at [museumoficecream.com](https://www.museumoficecream.com/book-austin/). Mocktail menus [Eberly](https://eberlyaustin.com/) Going zero-proof in January doesn't mean you're doomed to monotonous dining. Eberly's new array of zero-proof cocktails are anything but boring. The three lively additions include the Clover Club (Seedlip Garden 108, lemon juice, raspberry and pineapple gomme syrup); the Spiced Banana Old-Fashioned (spiritless Kentucky 74, spiced banana-cacao nib gomme syrup, chocolate bitters); and the Basil Matcha Fizz (Spiritless Jalisco 55, basil matcha syrup, coconut milk, soda water). Reservations can be made via [Resy](https://resy.com/cities/atx/eberly?date=2024-01-05&seats=2). [Electric Shuffle](https://electricshuffleusa.com/austin/location-austin) Sober folks can enjoy playing high-tech shuffleboard in style this January with Electric Shuffle's new menu of mocktails. The new non-boozy offerings include a salted caramel espresso \"MartiNO,\" a hibiscus \"NOjito,\" and the Sober Lucy, a NA version of the specialty cocktail Spicy Lucy. It's also a good excuse to go out and actually do something — even if you're not an expert swing dancer. Reservations can be made online at [electricshuffleusa.com](https://electricshuffleusa.com/austin/#bookings). [Armadillo Den](https://armadillodenaustin.com/) South Austin has a horde of hidden gem hangouts, and this neighborhood venue comes out on top with some of the best mocktails in the city, according to the [Austin Chronicle](https://www.austinchronicle.com/best-of-austin-restaurants/year:2023/poll:readers/category:beverages/3086438/). Among its award-winning mocktail lineup is the Southside Sipper (fresh watermelon juice, fresh lime juice, mint); the Frescadillo Paloma (pink and white grapefruit, guava, fresh lime juice, sea salt); the Fords Ranch Water (thai basil seltzer, cucumber, fresh lemon juice); and more. Hang out, catch a live music performance, and enjoy a refreshing beverage without the booze. [Meanwhile Brewing](https://www.meanwhilebeer.com/) Some might assume a beloved Austin brewery wouldn't have enough non-boozy options for Dry January participants, but they'd be sorely mistaken. In the spirit of community, Meanwhile Brewing is partnering with the [Sims Foundation](https://simsfoundation.org/) to expand their NA options and support people in recovery. Meanwhile's new mocktail menu includes the Simsply Bulletproof Sesame (frozen black sesame, moroccan mint tea reduction, brown butter fig syrup); the Sims on PC (Drink Weird moroccan mint tea, pandan, coconut milk, infused basil seed, piloncillo, lime zest syrup); and the Arnold Simski (Drink Weird moroccan mint tea, lavender and lemon syrup). Functional drinks and snacks [Clean Juice](https://www.cleanjuice.com/) Mocktails are delicious and fun to try, but if you're looking for something more functional for nourishment, Clean Juice has the perfect month-long deal for you. During the [January Smoothie Challenge](https://www.cleanjuice.com/january-smoothie-challenge/), guests who use the Clean Juice app to purchase a smoothie once a day for 20 days throughout the month will receive a $100 credit to use in February. The challenge ends on January 31, so there's still plenty of time to participate and win the challenge. [Explore CBD](https://austin.culturemap.com/r/entryeditor/Restart%20CBD) and [THC-infused products](https://happihourdrink.com/) CBD can provide many health benefits, such as reduced anxiety, better sleep, or pain relief, among other comforts. Women-owned [Restart CBD](https://austin.culturemap.com/r/entryeditor/Restart%20CBD) provides a variety of cannabis-infused edibles, beverages, vapes, and more for those who are comfortable with trading one vice for another. If not, Restart carries plenty of CBD isolate products, which contain no THC and don't get the user high at all. For a buzz without the alcohol, we're fans of [Happi's](https://happihourdrink.com/) THC-infused seltzers. Lemon Elderflower and Turkish Apple Tea were our favorites, but you can't go wrong with a classic flavor profile like Lime Wild Mint.",

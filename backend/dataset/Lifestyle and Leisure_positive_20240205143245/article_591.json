    "text": "Enjoy A Secluded Stroll On A Little-Known Path Along This Iconic Oregon River\nLooking for a beautiful secluded riverside hiking trail in Oregon? Try the Sandy River Trail #770, a gorgeous, little-known path along the Sandy River near Mount Hood Village, Oregon. It’s a true\nOregon hidden gem!\nI happened upon this wonderful path along the Sandy River while visiting the area with my kids. We lucked out on a dry, sunny November day. The sun was streaming through the trees and we were the only ones on the trail. We spotted one fisherman during our hike, but otherwise, we enjoyed the path through the forest and along the riverbanks completely to ourselves.\nFor more information about this little-known trail, visit the U.S. Forest Service’s\nMt. Hood National Forest Sandy River Trail #770 webpage. If your visit to this lovely forest hike includes a drive, you may want to stock up on car-friendly snacks and/or bring a lunch to enjoy along the way.\nWe’d love to know how you enjoyed your walk along this trail. Please leave a comment to let us know about your experience. Also, feel free to share your favorite off-the-beaten-path trails in Oregon that we should check out next.\n ",

    "text": "[according to data](https://data.census.gov/)from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s 2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. What you need to know Overall, League City, Seabrook and Clear Lake Shores each saw several minority groups increase in their overall population share, according to the data. League City, for example, saw Hispanic or Latino individuals grow in their respective share, as well as Black or African American individuals. Its white population, which represents the majority of residents, declined by 3 percentage points. Seabrook saw a similar change to League City, with its white population declining in overall population share by 5 percentage points and increasing its share of Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, American Indian and Alaskan Native, and Asian residents. However, Clear Lake Shores saw the most substantial change out of the three cities, according to the data. In 2017, the city had just three groups registering a percentage. In 2022, that doubled to six. Meanwhile, its share of Hispanic or Latino individuals nearly doubled. What else? League City and Seabrook saw their [respective total populations](https://communityimpact.com/houston/bay-area/government/2024/01/03/community-snapshot-bay-area-sees-overall-growth-in-population-from-2017-to-2022/)increase over the last five years, while Clear Lake Shores saw a slight decline. Clear Lake Shores also [has an older population](https://communityimpact.com/houston/bay-area/government/2024/01/04/community-snapshot-bay-area-sees-majority-of-population-under-age-40/)than both League City and Seabrook, according to the data.",

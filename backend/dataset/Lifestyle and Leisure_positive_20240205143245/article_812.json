    "text": "Blessed are the Persistent\nHistory is filled with people who quit too early, and thus never fulfilled their key task in life.\nWith a new year upon us, it’s good to think about how God pours His blessings on those who persist. Even when facing adversity, when the time comes, they push forward with what they feel He has called them to do.\nOf course, in the\nBeatitudes of Jesus He never said, “Blessed are the persistent.” But throughout the Bible, we do find encouragements to press on, to keep plugging away at doing the right thing.\nA Miracle\nAmerica greatly benefitted from some of our nation’s founders doing just that. The colonial armies experienced one military setback after another, with only a few sporadic victories interspersed.\nThe victory over the British was a miracle. That we could become independent as a nation is an amazing story.\nGeorge Washington himself\nsaid in his First Inaugural Address in 1789:\n[I]t would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official Act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in the Councils of Nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the People of the United States.\nPlease Support The Stream: Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day. []()\nThus, Washington’s first act as president was to offer public praise and prayers to God.\nHe also\nsaid that nobody should be more grateful to Almighty God than the people of the United States because by His help that the founders were able to create this nation: “Every step, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.”\nWork Against Evil\nOf course, our liberties fought for by the founders are at risk today, primarily because we as a nation have forgotten God and flaunt our immorality in His face. As founding father Patrick Henry\nwarned, “It is when a people forget God that tyrants forge their chains.”\nCommitted Christians are called at this present time to persist in working against many of the evils that we face today, such as the totalitarian instincts of an ever-growing bloated government, or the educational establishment which so often provides more indoctrination than education for our children. The work on behalf of the unborn must continue.\nThe Pilgrims\nstated their goal in the Mayflower Compact in 1620. This sums up well a worthy goal for the committed believer. They came, they said, “for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith.”\nFight for Freedom\nPresident Ronald Reagan\nhttps://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/january-5-1967-inaugural-address-public-ceremony us of the high stakes if we lose this nation:\nFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.\nThe hour is late and the need to get involved is great. During this time of New Year’s reflections, may God give us the resolve to persist in His calling. If each one did his or her part, we could help stem the tide.\nInspirational Thoughts\nSometimes the urgencies in life crowd out the important things. Here are some inspirational thoughts to help persist in doing the right thing, come what may:\n- Motivator Earl Nightingale\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/quotes/32384-never-give-up-on-a-dream-just-because-of-the, “Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.”\n- Highly underrated President Calvin Coolidge\nnoted, “We cannot do everything at once, but we can do something at once.”\n- Hotel magnate Conrad Hilton\ndeclared, “Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don’t quit.”\n- Founding father Benjamin Franklin\nobserved, “Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.”\n- Eventual deathbed convert Oscar Wilde\nhttps://www.azquotes.com/quote/876042, “Many of the great achievements of the world were accomplished by tired and discouraged men who kept on working.”\nDo Not Give Up\nBut most importantly comes advice directly from the Bible, the Word of God. The Apostle Paul gives sound advice, for New Years’, and throughout the year, Paul\nsays in Galatians: “And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”\nSo in 2024, may God use us to labor for the greater good that much more diligently and wisely, as we continue to\npray “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”\nDr. Jerry Newcombe is the executive director of\nProvidence Forum, a division of D. James Kennedy Ministries, where Jerry also serves as senior producer and an on-air contributor. He has written/co-written 33 books, including (with D. James Kennedy), What If Jesus Had Never Been Born? and (with Dr. Peter Lillback), George Washington’s Sacred Fire.",

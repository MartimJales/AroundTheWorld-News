    "text": "Several calves waited anxiously to be let out of their chute as Savanna Meyer, assistant coach of the Montana State University rodeo team, lined them up one by one in an indoor arena.\nBehind Meyer, Mesa Radue, 16, and her horse, French Fry, readied themselves to chase down each animal.\nMeyer opened the gate, and the calf and French Fry both took off in a sprint, with Radue spinning a lasso over her head.\nAfter securing the rope over the calf’s head, Radue released the animal so she could get ready to chase the next one.\nThis practice session on Jan. 2 was held inside the Stock Family MSU Rodeo Facility, which the university bought about a year and a half ago to support the program, which has a history of success at regional and national levels, including in 2023.\nBefore the team owned the arena, athletes had to pay higher rates to board their horses elsewhere and take hours out of their schedules to transport them for practice.\nThe MSU Alumni Foundation bought the facility in 2022 after using it as practice space for more than a decade, according to an article from MSU’s Mountains and Minds magazine. The rodeo team used to pay about $9,000 monthly to use it, Meyer said.\nThe facility cost about $4.85 million to buy, head coach Kyle Whitaker said, but the mortgage is now fully paid off. The property has indoor and outdoor arenas, pens, grooming space and areas to board horses and stock animals. The practice area is in Belgrade, off of Spain Bridge Road.\n'Completely changes the program'\nSeveral team members said having the facility is a major improvement that makes it easier to prepare for competitions. There are about 50 athletes on MSU's rodeo team this year and around 80 horses.\nElizabeth Bolich, a senior on the team, practiced barrel racing with Meyer on Jan. 2 at the indoor arena. She has been on the team since she was a freshman, and said the new facility is great for practices compared to how they used to operate.\n“It’s so much better,” Bolich said. “We still practiced here, but it took twice as long ...because we had to go get our horses, drive here, hook up our trailers, drive back. Just having them here is so nice.”\nBolich placed 14th in the Big Sky Region for goat tying last season, according to the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association.\nMeyer started her coaching position in August. She previously competed on the team from 2018 to 2021, before graduating with a master's degree in community health. The facility “completely changes the program for the better,” because it’s easier for students to practice in the same place they board their horses, she said.\n“We have so much more flexibility,” Meyer said. “... It just simplifies kids' daily life.\"\n\"When I was on the team, I would spend, three, four hours a day just going out to my horses, hooking up my trailers, driving out to practice, driving home, unhooking, putting horses away. It was a huge ordeal, and when you're trying to fit that on top of several hours at practice, class all day, maybe a little work here and there, I mean that added a ton to your day and I think it just was pretty stressful and expensive,\" she added.\nThe team has made several improvements to the property since buying it, Meyer said, and there are plans to do more.\nDuring the first week of the fall semester, Meyer and Whitaker built 24 new pens to hold students’ horses. The week of Jan. 8, the team is hoping to get university approval to take out the wooden boards lining the indoor arena walls and replace them with advertisements to support the team, Mayer said.\nNext year, Meyer said, the goal is to build more shelters to keep the animals safer in the winter months.\nAnother bonus of the facility is using it as an event space, Meyer said. The team organized several jackpot events this fall at the facility, including barrel racing, goat tying, breakaway roping and calf roping. The money raised from the events went toward the facility costs.\nThe team wants the jackpot events to become a “staple” for the program because of how successful they were, Meyer said.\nBringing in community members with more events is also a recruiting tool, Meyer said.\nRadue, who practiced roping with Meyer, is a homeschool student who competes in local rodeo events. She worked out a deal with the MSU team to keep her animals at the facility in exchange for helping the team with chores and running events. When she’s ready for college, Radue said, she has her eye on the MSU.\nA stronger team\nHaving one place for the athletes to come to has helped the team bond more closely, Meyer said.\n“I always kind of felt like everybody was pretty spread out,\" Meyer said. \"We were all doing our own thing, which is fine, I mean, we got by. MSU had a ton of success and did an amazing thing with what they had, but I do think that there’s an element of having everybody keeping their horses there, having everybody’s trailers there, them helping feed for each other on different mornings. I think that really adds to the team aspect of it because we really do have a home base.”\nSince buying the facility, Meyer said, MSU and the community supporting the team has started to realize how much time and money it takes to be a rodeo athlete. Almost all of the student-athletes have to have their own horses.\n“I think it is good for the community to know how much commitment that the rodeo team has to take care of animals,” Meyer said. “They’re out here every single day feeding their horses before school and paying to get their horse’s vet work and all of that stuff. Most students, they have to take care of themselves, and then you throw a bunch of animals in there and it’s pretty impressive.”\nWith the new facility in place, Meyer and Whitaker said they’re even more hopeful for the future of an already successful program. Being able to more closely monitor athlete progress is huge for the team, Meyer said.\nSince starting as head coach in 2021, Whitaker said, he has connected with the team he inherited, and it’s looking like they will “really take off” in the spring season.\n“It's a lot of fun for me to watch kids develop,” said Whitaker, who led a record-breaking collegiate rodeo career as an athlete. “I like to give them a chance to have the same feeling of success and achievement that I had during my rodeo career. I think that's really huge in a person's life to be able to accomplish your goals. ...I want to give them the opportunity to do that as well.”\nThe Bobcats finished 2023 with a number of big wins in the region and nation.\nFor the second time, senior Paige Rasmussen earned the national championship in goat tying. Four athletes placed in the nation’s top 12 for steer wrestling. As of November, the Bobcat men’s team are ranked second nationally and the women’s team is ranked sixth.\nMSU’s men’s team is ranked first overall in the Big Sky Region, and the women’s team is in second.\nLeading the team is a way for Whitaker to help preserve the “cowboy way of life,” he said.\n“I think it’s a unique way of life — unique to this country,” Whitaker said. “...People that had to be tough and rugged individuals and had to have a good relationship with animals — know how to work with animals. There’s a misconception that rodeo’s cruel to animals, but we’re the people that love animals and want to be working with them every day. Most of the people that rodeo would rather spend time with a horse than a person.”\nIn August, a group of lobbyists filed a ballot initiative with the state to designate rodeo as Montana’s official sport. If approved, the measure would appear on the November 2024 ballot.\nWhile the move would be mostly symbolic, Whitaker said, it could make sure rodeo is around for the future.\n“I think that’d be a pretty neat deal,” Whitaker said. “Just kind of highlight how Montana values rodeo, values their cowboy heritage. ... I don’t see it really changing anything in my day-to-day, but it does give you a little more confidence in the future of this sport.”\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Patrick Bouman can be reached at 406-582-2648 or pbouman@dailychronicle.com",

    "text": "When odds and ends started to be secretly tidied away in his shed during the night, Rodney Holbrook set about getting to the root of the mystery. The retired postman, 75, set up a camera and trained it on his work bench to try to identify the culprit. And to his surprise, the footage revealed that the do-gooder was an industrious little mouse. In scenes straight out of a Beatrix Potter book, the rodent was picking up clothes pegs, screwdrivers, corks, nuts and bolts – and dropping them all into a nearby pot. Even the most awkward of objects did not seem to faze the mouse, which in one scene grappled determinedly with a cable tie before finally getting it into the pot. The rodent was picking up clothes pegs, screwdrivers, corks, nuts and bolts – and dropping them all into a nearby pot When odds and ends started to be secretly tidied away in his shed during the night, Rodney Holbrook set about getting to the root of the mystery Even the most awkward of objects did not seem to faze the mouse The retired postman, 75, set up a camera and trained it on his work bench to try to identify the culprit The scenes looked as though they were straight out of a Beatrix Potter book The new cleaner does such a good job that Mr Holbrook, from Powys, midWales, says he does not bother to tidy up his workspace any more. The images in the film are reminiscent of Ms Potter's children's story The Tailor Of Gloucester – which involves mice secretly doing stitching and sewing work for a tailor as he sleeps. 'It has been going on for months. I call him Welsh Tidy Mouse,' says Mr Holbrook. 'At first, I noticed that some food that I was putting out for the birds was ending up in some old shoes I was storing in the shed, so I set up a camera. 'I couldn't believe it when I saw that the mouse was tidying up. 'He moved all sorts of things into the box, bits of plastic, nuts and bolts. I don't bother to tidy up now, as I know he will see to it. 'It's happened practically every night now for two months.'",

    "text": "Want to kick off 2024 by being more organised and keeping your resolutions in check? Here are some DIY crafts that can help you achieve your goals — be it saving money to buy a new cricket bat or scoring A+ in every subject.\nSavings jar\nMaterials needed\nMason jar\nAcrylic paint\nPaintbrushes\nPencil\nScissors\nPiece of cardboard\nGlue\nMethod\nTo start, thoroughly clean and dry your mason jar. Up will only be needing the jar for this craft, not the lid.\nPaint the jar white and let it air dry.\nOnce dry, you can start painting your desired designs. Be it a rainbow, cartoon characters or just some squiggly. Use as many colours as you like and let your creativity flow.\nNext, trace a circle on the cardboard with your pencil and get an adult to help you cut it. The circle has to be the same size as the mouth of the mason jar.\nCut a slit in the middle of the circle — big enough for coins and notes to fit in.\nPaint the circle the colour of your choice and let it dry completely.\nFirmly stick the circle to the top of the mason jar with glue and your savings jar is ready!\nMini scrapbook\nMaterials needed\nUnruled A4 book\nChart paper (in multiple colours)\nScissors\nStapler\nGlue\nVarious photos and memorabilia\nMethod\nOn the first page, you can name your scrapbook how you like. Something along the line of ‘My Memories’.\nNext, you can start by dividing your A4 book into 12 equal parts, one for each month. Make sure each month has at least 3-4 pages.\nAt the start of each month, you can write the name of the month in bold colours and start decorating the page. You can stick photos, movie tickets or any other memorabilia. You can also mention how your resolutions are faring.\nIn addition to memorabilia, cut two squares of chart paper — In one square, you can write things that you are grateful for, and in the other can write your favourite moment from that month. You can stick the chart paper in the book, and decorate as you wish.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 05 January 2024, 21:05 IST)",

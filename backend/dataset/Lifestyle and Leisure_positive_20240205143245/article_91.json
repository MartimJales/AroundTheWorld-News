    "text": "Home » Entertainment » Bollywood » January 5, 2024 Entertainment I am a big fan of Katrina Deccan Chronicle.| Lipika Varma\nPublished on: January 5, 2024 | Updated on: January 5, 2024 Actors Katrina, Vijay Sethupathi and director Sriram Raghavan speak out about their experience working on the film Merry Christmas Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif\nMerry Christmas, starring Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi and directed by Sriram Raghavan is a suspenseful dark thriller filmed simultaneously in Hindi and Tamil and produced by Ramesh Taurani and Sanjay Routray. Speaking at the first press conference of the film, coinciding with the trailer release, Katrina, Vijay and Shriram answered a barrage of questions from the media.\nWish list of directors/actors from Bollywood\nI don’t have any particular wish list — Isske sath kam karna hai, uske sath kam karna hai...aisa kuch nahi hai. Mostly, my directors choose their actors, I don’t discuss that. I am totally dependent on the filmmakers and of course the story – that’s my main concern.\nOn working with Katrina\nI am a very big fan of Katrina. I was very happy when I met her on the first day. She is a very dedicated actor. She asks many questions and thinks about the part. She may come with an idea but also listens to others’ suggestions. She puts in so much sensibility and effort into her performance. That’s the reason she has been in the industry for so long. I feel she is not only beautiful but also sensible.\nOn working with director Shriram Raghavan\nI met Shriram Sir for the first time in Melbourne. At first sight I felt he was a very serious man. I spent almost 30 days with him. I learned a lot from him. I understood him and knew what he was expecting me to do in a particular scene. I have learnt to utilize freedom of thought and expressions which I will carry forward while shooting for other films.\nOn choosing Merry Christmas\nIt has always been my intention to be associated with good stories. It’s not just the actors, the director is also of utmost importance. Working with director Shriram Raghavan was on my bucket list and this story was right for me as well.\nOn making a change from commercial entertainers\nYou will feel a little nervous or fearful when you step out of the commercial entertainer. But you need to overcome that fear. The experience is worthwhile for me as an actor and performer. I give my heart and soul to every film.\nExpectations from Merry Christmas\nI think every film has its audience. Also, Shriram Raghavan has a loyal fan following. We have made a film that we are very proud about. Waiting to watch the reaction of the audiences.\n\"I feel she [Katrina] is not only beautiful but also sensible.\"\n\"You will feel a little nervous or fearful when you step out of the commercial entertainer.\"",

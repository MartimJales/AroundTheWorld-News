    "text": "Everything Bagel Cheese Ball is an easy appetizer that‚Äôs always a huge hit at parties! It‚Äôs great for making ahead of time with a few simple ingredients. The cheese ball itself is made with cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar and parmesan, and it‚Äôs all coated in crunchy homemade everything bagel seasoning!\nEntertaining is so much fun with recipes like\nRanch Cheddar Cheese Ball and Mini Cheese Balls Trio.\nTable of Contents\nHave you tried everything bagel seasoning yet? Oh, you must try it as soon as possible. I‚Äôm not just talking about everything bagels, I‚Äôm talking about the seasoning itself. You can use it on sandwiches, rolls, pinwheels, chicken, hummus, dips, and so many other foods. This simple combination of garlic, onion, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and salt is not just for bagels anymore.\nCheese ball is that classic appetizer that I make for almost every holiday. It‚Äôs so easy and always popular at parties. I‚Äôve tried many different flavors and incorporated different seasonal ingredients, but this one is now our favorite. Cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning make a perfect pair, after all.\nYou can serve this cheese ball with so many options. Try it with pretzels, crackers, bagel chips, chips, celery, cucumbers, carrot sticks, and many other vegetables. If you have any cheese ball leftover, spread it on your toast or bagel in the morning. It makes an amazing spread for sandwiches as well!\nWhat is everything bagel seasoning?\nEverything bagel seasoning is pretty widely available in many grocery stores, but it‚Äôs so also easy to make at home whenever you need it. It‚Äôs a simple combination of dried minced garlic, dried minced onion, flaked salt, black sesame seeds, sesame seeds, and poppy seeds. Plus, it is a little cheaper to make your own seasoning.\nTo make everything bagel seasoning, simply combine all the ingredients together in a glass jar with a lid, close the lid tight, and shake it to mix. You can make it just for the recipe and make extra and store it in the same glass jar. Seasoning mixes tend to have a long shelf life, just make sure to store it in a cool, dark place.\nIngredient Notes\nEverything Bagel Seasoning ‚Äì This is a simple combination of dried minced garlic, dried minced onion, sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, poppy seeds and flaky salt. You can also buy it at the store already mixed and ready to use if you‚Äôd prefer.\nParmesan Cheese ‚Äì For the best flavor and consistency, use freshly grated parmesan cheese.\nSour Cream ‚Äì I don‚Äôt recommend using low-fat sour cream. It won‚Äôt have the same thick consistency as regular sour cream.\nCream Cheese ‚Äì This should also NOT be low-fat! Plus, make sure you buy plain cream cheese with no added flavors.\nWhite Cheddar Cheese ‚Äì I like using white cheddar because the color matches the other ingredients in the cheese ball. However, you can use yellow cheddar if that‚Äôs what you already have on hand. The only difference between yellow and white cheddar is the color. There is no difference in flavor.\nSee recipe card for complete information on ingredients and quantities.\nHow to Make Everything Bagel Cheese Ball\nMake the seasoning. Combine all of the ingredients in a jar, close with a lid and shake. Alternately, you can can mix everything together in a bowl with a spoon. (1)\nLet the cream cheese soften. Pull the cream cheese out of the refrigerator to soften 30-45 minutes before making the cheese ball.\nAdd more cheeses. Combine cream cheese with sour cream and grated cheeses (2).\nAdd seasoning. Mix the everything bagel seasoning into the cheese mixture (3).\nTransfer to a bowl. Place a large piece of plastic wrap inside a deep bowl and transfer the cream cheese mixture into the bowl (4).\nForm a cheese ball. Bring all the ends of plastic wrap together and twist to seal. Shape the mixture into a ball and place it back into a bowl (5).\nChill. Refrigerate the cheese ball overnight, or for at least 2 hours.\nRoll it in seasoning. About 20 minutes before serving, unwrap the cheese ball and roll it in everything bagel seasoning.\nPRO TIP: Let the cheese ball sit for 15-20 minutes before serving it to the guests. This will give it a chance to soften and be easier to spread.\nHow to Make Mini Cheese Balls\nPrepare the cream cheese mixture according to the recipe, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. No need to shape the mixture into a ball since it will be divided into small portions.\nTo keep mini cheese balls the same size, use a cookie scoop to scoop out even amounts of cheese mixture and roll them into balls. Roll each ball in seasoning mix.\nInsert pretzel sticks into each mini cheese ball. Note that you may need a little more seasoning mix for mini cheese balls.\nMake Ahead, Storing, Freezing\nMake Ahead: One of the reasons I love this appetizer is that I can make it ahead of time. Just don‚Äôt roll it in seasoning until right before serving, that way the seasoning doesn‚Äôt get soggy. You can also wrap the cheese ball in an extra layer of aluminum foil, after it‚Äôs been wrapped in plastic wrap. This will give it a little more protection from exposure to air.\nStoring: Properly stored and refrigerated, a cheese ball can last up to 7 days. Make sure to wrap it airtight in plastic or other wrap.\nFreezing: Technically, you can freeze a cheese ball before coating it in seasoning or nuts. In practice though, I have noticed a textural difference after the cheese ball has been defrosted. Since cream cheese and sour cream both contain a good amount of liquid, it doesn‚Äôt retain the same smooth texture after being defrosted.\nRecipe FAQs\nAll different kinds of different dippers work well! Crackers, pretzel chips, crisp veggies (like sliced bell peppers), pita and crostini are all great options. You can also plate this cheese ball with various meats as part of a charcuterie board.\nAbsolutely! You can shape it into a football for game day, a Christmas tree for a holiday party, an egg for Easter, and whatever other themed shapes you can think of. The best way to shape it is on the wrap, then wrap it in that shape and refrigerate for a couple of hours to set.\nYes, you technically can use a lactose free cream cheese but it won‚Äôt be as dense. It will still hold its shape, just make sure to strain off any liquid in the cream cheese container before adding it to the cheese ball mixture. If the cheese ball seems a little too thin, you can always add a little more grated cheddar and/or parmesan cheese.\nMore Party Appetizer Recipes To Try\nDID YOU MAKE THIS RECIPE?

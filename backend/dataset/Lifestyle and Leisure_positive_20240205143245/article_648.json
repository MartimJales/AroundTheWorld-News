    "text": "Pedro Porro's 25-yard special helped Tottenham stumble into the FA Cup fourth round with a hard-fought home win over Burnley.\nSpurs were far from vintage and a replay at Turf Moor appeared on the cards until Ange Postecoglou watched full-back Porro make the breakthrough with a superb strike in the 78th minute.\nIt earned Tottenham a deserved fourth win from five matches, but Clarets boss Vincent Kompany could take positives after a solid display and they will now concentrate fully on staying in the Premier League.\nSpurs had already beaten Burnley 5-2 this season, but they were missing their hat-trick hero from that sunny September day with Son Heung-min away for the Asian Cup and the visitors started brightly in north London.\nAnass Zaroury blazed over early on before Wilson Odobert tested Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with a long-range effort.\nPostecoglou had only made two changes for this third-round tie and arguably his strongest available team soon started to click into gear.\nRicharlison scuffed wide after a slick move before Brennan Johnson’s curler forced Arijanet Muric into action.\nBrennan Johnson reacts after seeing his shot saved by Arijanet Muric in the Burnley goal The stadium was united in applause soon after when the clock struck 16 minutes as a tribute took place for Tottenham fan Harry Pitman, who was killed on New Year’s Eve.\nGiovani Lo Celso hooked over at the end of a touching minute’s applause before VAR checked Rodrigo Bentancur’s tackle on Zaroury, but Spurs’ stand-in skipper avoided punishment.\nKompany’s side created their best chance with 27 minutes gone when Zaroury’s scooped pass put Zeki Amdouni through on goal but he fired over, and while the offside flag was raised, it would have counted.\nJohnson did flash wide from a Porro centre before half-time, but a drab first 45 ended goalless in N17.\nTottenham were sent out early for the second half and it initially had the desired effect with Dejan Kulusevski driving over, while Lo Celso and Johnson tested Muric.\nSpurs were still trying to walk the ball in, though, and groans were audible from the home fans when Kulusevski decided to pass instead of shoot from a promising position.\nLo Celso limped off moments later and Burnley also lost Charlie Taylor to a shoulder injury, which forced Kompany into a triple substitution with Nathan Redmond amongst those introduced.\nJohnson had called Muric into action again by this point with a volley into the ground before the hosts had half-hearted penalty appeals waved away when the attacker went down after slight contact by Josh Brownhill.\nA replay at Turf Moor seemed to loom large as the seconds ticked away, but Porro had other ideas.\nMoments after Richarlison failed to get on the end of Kulusevski’s cross, Porro won back possession from Ameen Al-Dakhil and let fly from 25 yards, with his dipping effort nestling into the corner.\nTottenham substitute Ryan Sessegnon nearly put the game to bed in the 86th minute but Muric saved and Burnley’s goalkeeper almost set up a late leveller from a corner only for Amdouni to volley wide\nA Bobby De Cordova-Reid stunner saw Fulham beat Rotherham in the third round of the FA Cup at Craven Cottage.\nThe Jamaica international capitalised on a mistake and scored his second in as many games after Sunday's winner during Fulham’s 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League.\nVictory for Marco Silva’s men has kept them in both cup competitions ahead of Fulham’s Carabao Cup semi-final clash against Liverpool later this month.\nA cagey first few minutes in west London saw Andreas Pereira showcase his quick feet before his driven shot cannoned off a defender. Fulham appealed for a handball but referee Simon Hooper waved them away and a corner was given.\nRotherham had little to show for their efforts, and their low defensive line invited pressure in the 20th minute.\nFulham’s De Cordova-Reid threatened with a cross and the Cottagers’ Championship opponents were fortunate to not go a goal down from the following corner when Rodrigo Muniz’s effort was blocked.\nDe Cordova-Reid opened the scoring in spectacular fashion after 24 minutes.\nGoalscorer Bobby Decordova-Reid is embraced by his Fulham team-mates Rotherham’s attempt to play the ball out from the back ran into trouble when Harry Wilson’s press forced a turnover and De Cordova-Reid’s long-range effort flew past Viktor Johansson into the top left corner.\nA lethargic Rotherham rarely ventured into Fulham’s territory but Jordan Hugill’s offside goal from a Tom Eaves cross added to their frustrations.\nFulham nearly doubled their lead in the 42nd minute but Pereira was denied by a post.\nRight-back Kenny Tete marauded forward and delivered a dangerous cross to the unmarked Pereira, who struck the ball into the ground before it cannoned off a post and into the path of Harrison Reed, whose close-range shot was deflected behind for a corner.\nFulham continued to be lively after the break. The dangerous Tete surged forward and his drilled cross caused Rotherham keeper Johansson to fumble the ball. The Swedish international’s blushes were saved when he made a stop from six yards out.\nThe hosts slowed the game down and dominated the ball but the game burst into life through Issa Diop after 76 minutes.\nThe centre-back picked up the ball and cut through Rotherham’s midfield before a neat combination with Timothy Castagne saw the towering defender’s first-time strike narrowly miss the target.\nFulham countered from a corner during five added minutes but Carlos Vinicius’ shot was saved after Willian squared it to him.\nA rocket from Tommy Doyle kept Wolves in the FA Cup despite playing with 10 men for 81 minutes at Brentford.\nWanderers lost Joao Gomes to an early red card and were trailing to Neal Maupay's first-half goal when Doyle struck from 20 yards to secure a draw and a replay.\nIn a niggly encounter, Gomes was given his marching orders for chopping down Bees captain Christian Norgaard.\nBut Wolves could easily point to a similar challenge from Mikkel Damsgaard on Doyle which went unpunished.\nBrentford were looking for a measure of revenge for the 4-1 defeat they were dealt by the same opposition in the Premier League nine days earlier.\nThey suffered a collective defensive meltdown in that loss and the nerves were hardly settled when goalkeeper David Strakosha, making only his third appearance of the season, passed the ball straight to Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.\nThe Brazilian managed to round Strakosha but ran into defender Mathias Jorgensen, who cleared the ball over his own crossbar.\nMoments later Wolves found themselves a player light after Gomes caught Norgaard on the heel with his studs and was shown a straight red card by referee Tony Harrington.\nTommy Doyle scores his first goal for Wolves It was a further injury blow for already-depleted Brentford with Denmark midfielder Norgaard unable to continue.\nFormer Wolves defender Nathan Collins, who was directly culpable for two of his old side’s goals in last week’s horror show, almost made amends at the right end of the pitch with a shot which curled narrowly over.\nThen Bees midfielder Josh Dasilva, making his first appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in August, tested Wanderers keeper Jose Sa with a low, skidding drive before the hosts went ahead five minutes before half-time.\nAfter Wolves failed to clear a Mathias Jensen free-kick, the ball ricocheted to the feet of Maupay who rifled it home from eight yards for his third goal of the season.\nAfter the break Damsgaard’s shot was well blocked by Sa and Dasilva hit the side-netting before, almost out of nowhere, Wolves equalised.\nA short corner was worked by Pedro Neto to Doyle on the edge of the area, with the England Under-21 midfielder taking a touch before lashing the ball left-footed into the top corner.\nIt was Doyle’s first goal for Wolves and he had a taste for more, only this time he cracked another drive straight into the face of Jensen, who had to go off after a concussion check.\nBrentford could have won it late on but substitute Myles Peart-Harris side-footed wide and Sa saved Keane Lewis-Potter’s header from point-blank range.\nA melee at the end of the match suggested these two teams are pretty sick of the sight of each other, which could at least make for a spicy replay in just over a week.",

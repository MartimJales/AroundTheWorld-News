Recipe of the Week: Black Bean Burgers Ingredients: - Canned black beans - 2 spring onions (scallions) - Handful of cilantro - 1 cup breadcrumbs - Â½ a lime - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce - 1 tablespoon of tahini - 2 tablespoons of avocado oil - Mini buns Instructions: Step 1 Drain and rinse the canned black beans. Add them to a large bowl. Step 2 Finely chop two spring onions and a handful of fresh cilantro and add to the beans. Step 3 Add one cup of breadcrumbs, half of a lime's zest, one tablespoon of soy sauce and one tablespoon of tahini and mix and mash well with your hands until it comes together into a soft burger mix. Step 4 Take a scoop of the mixture, roll it into a ball and flatten into a one inch burger-shaped patty. Continue with the remaining mixture. Step 5 Chill your mini burgers until required â€“ ideally at least 30 minutes. Step 6 To cook, heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan. Cook the mini burgers over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. Step 7 Assemble the burger by adding your favorite toppings and condiments. Expert tip: Elevate this plant-based meal by serving with a side of crispy kale chips. Simply rinse, chop and bake kale leaves and sprinkle with salt for the perfect pairing.

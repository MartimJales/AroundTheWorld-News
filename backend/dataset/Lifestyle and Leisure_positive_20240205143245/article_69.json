    "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Former Syracuse basketball star Eric Devendorf’s ED23 Foundation will provide a little warmth at an upcoming Hat, Scarf, and Glove Giveaway event on Saturday. The giveaway will occur at the Boys & Girls Club, Central Village from 10 a.m. to noon. Devendorf will be there all morning to help with the giveaway. Sponsors include Printing & Promotional Solutions, Limp Lizard BBQ, Ale \"N\" Angus Pub and PTM Solar. Their support has made it possible for the ED23 Foundation to purchase over 1000 brand-new gloves, 1000 scarves, and 1000 hats. “Each scarf, glove, and hat is a small act of kindness, made possible by our sponsors whose commitment goes beyond business,\" Devendorf said. “It's our way of standing with Syracuse's underprivileged youth, a promise that they are seen, cared for, and valued.” Eric and the ED23 Foundation, supported by its sponsors, will be distributing these winter essentials to anyone in need. Todd Ruetsch, owner of Printing and Promotional Solutions and ED23 Foundation Chair said, \"Growing up in Syracuse, I've seen the struggles firsthand. Being part of this initiative isn't just giving back; it's a way to pay it forward and make a tangible difference in these kids' lives. It's an honor to contribute to such a meaningful cause.\" For more information, click [here](https://ed23foundation.org/news/ed23-foundations-hat-scarf-and-glove-giveaway-bringing-a-little-warmth-to-syracuses-underprivileged-youth/).",

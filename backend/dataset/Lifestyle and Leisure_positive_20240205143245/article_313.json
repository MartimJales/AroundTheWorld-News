    "text": "The BBC’s binge-worthy reality gameshow The Traitors is back for a second series and once again, millions of us are obsessed with the battle of wits between the crime-cracking Faithfuls and the murderous cape-clad Traitors.\nNot to mention host Claudia Winkleman’s tweed-chic outfits as she presides over psychological warfare in that enviable Scottish Highlands castle.\nSince The Traitors is essentially a parlour game on steroids – the original Dutch format, De Verraders, was loosely based on party game Mafia – it’s possible to recreate its bluffs and betrayals in the comfort of your own home.\nHere’s how to play your own version. A black fringe and fingerless gloves are strictly optional…\n1. Mafia The Russian social deduction game, devised by Moscow University psychology professor Dimitry Davidoff in 1987, pits innocent civilians against the evil Mafiosi hidden in their midst. As with The Traitors, the baddies covertly kill at night .\nDuring the day phase, surviving civilians debate and vote to eliminate suspects. It needs at least four players but the more the merrier, meaning roles such as detective, doctor and mayor can be added to the basic civilians versus mobsters set-up.\nRussian social deduction game Mafia needs at least four players Credit : LightField Studios Inc./Alamy Stock Photo Playing cards can be used by simply assigning them to the different roles, shuffling and picking at random. Games can take anything from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players and the speed of each day and night cycle.\nVariants include Werewolf (see below), a Spaghetti Western version called Bang!, The Resistance (set amid a war between a totalitarian government and rebel groups) and the Arthurian-themed Avalon.\nHow to start: Either buy a set of Mafia cards and instruction booklet (£14.99), or use a standard deck of playing cards and search online (look on wikihow.com/Play-Mafia for a how-to guide).\n2. Werewolf The American interactive fiction writer Andrew Plotkin reinvented Mafia as Werewolf in 1997, believing the gangland theme lacked universal resonance and werewolves also worked with the concept of a hidden enemy who looked innocuous during daytime.\nThis time, medieval townsfolk try to purge their village of deadly lupine shapeshifters. It’s similar to Mafia, so can also be played with a deck of cards, or even scraps of paper, but works best with seven or more players, so you can have a moderator, a seer, a doctor, two werewolves and some villagers. Werewolf involves more open discussion, so is arguably closer to The Traitors in format. Feel free to add DIY howling-at-the-moon spooky sound effects and dramatic deaths.\nHow to start: Buy a set of Werewolf cards (£10.39; playwerewolf.co ).\n3. Secret Hitler Just in case mafiosi and werewolves weren’t sinister enough for your tastes, this variation on the theme – launched in 2016 after a crowdfunding campaign – has players assume the roles of liberals and fascists in the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic, with one player becoming Hitler himself.\nDuring a game of Secret Hitler, party-aligned teams take part in elections Party-aligned teams take part in elections, then compete to advance their agenda, voting “Ja!” or “Nein!” to policy proposals. But who is Hitler? And can they be assassinated before ascending to power? Yes, it’s Nazi fun for all the family.\nHow to start: Buy the beautifully designed boxed version (£35 ) or play for free by downloading the rules and components online, then getting busy with a printer and scissors.\n4. Among Us This is an online multiplayer version for the gaming generation, released in 2018 and influenced by John Carpenter’s horror film The Thing, as well as Mafia and Werewolf. It’s set in space, with players represented by colourful cartoon astronauts, assigned the role of Crewmates or Impostors.\nThe former must complete tasks while identifying and voting out the latter before they’re killed. Among Us saw a huge surge in popularity during lockdown, subsequently winning a slew of gaming awards in 2020 and 2021. Updates with new maps and outfits are still being released.\nHow to start: Download for free from Apple App Store or Google Play.\n5. The Traitors online game Would you prefer to be a Faithful... or a Traitor? Credit : Mark Mainz/Studio Lambert/BBC/PA Wire Launching on Friday night after the third episode airs – complete with an agonising cliffhanger – this official prediction game enables players to earn points by correctly guessing who will be murdered, who will be banished and who will make it to the series’ endgame, with bonus questions along the way.\nA little like fantasy football, there’s an overall leaderboard for all Traitors fans. You can also form separate mini-leagues with friends, family or colleagues. The show has also inspired its own branded board game (£21.99).\nHow to start: Web, tablet and mobile versions are free at bbc.co.uk/traitors .\n6. Town of Salem Another online multiplayer affair, with strategic and deceptive as well as deductive elements. First launched a decade ago, it sees locals and gangsters battle for control of the witch trial-era town by unmasking and lynching each other\nA sequel, the imaginatively titled Town of Salem 2, was released last year with the Mafia replaced by the Coven. Either version is playable on your phone, as is Among Us, so you can also liven up your commute with a spot of sleuthing and backstabbing.\nHow to start: Download for free from Apple App Store or Google Play.\n7. Cluedo The quintessentially British whodunit game, devised in 1942 by musician Anthony E Pratt during air raids on his home city of Birmingham. Players assume the role of one of the six suspects and turn detective to work out who murdered the victim, in which room and with what weapon.\nWas it Miss Scarlet in the library with lead piping? Or Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the billiard room? A timeless way to live out your Agatha Christie fantasies (and quite possibly fall out with your family).\nHow to start: Dig out your dusty old Waddingtons version from a cupboard or grudgingly buy a new set (£14.99).\n8. Wink Murder The most lo-fi and accessible version of the lot. Just try not to develop a nervous twitch mid-game. One player is assigned the role of detective and gets sent out of the room, while the others decide who will be the murderer.\nWhen the detective is called back in, the murderer starts killing by surreptitiously winking at their fellow players, who must die ostentatiously. The detective gets three chances to guess the culprit. Variations include “Deadly Handshake”, “Lonely Ghost” and, for the particularly bloodthirsty, “Slit Throat”.\nHow to start: Simply sit in a circle and let the lethal winking commence.\nRelated Topics Claudia Winkleman, BBC, Gaming",

    "text": "Honey Glazed Carrots are quick and easy to make with just a few ingredients that you likely already have on hand! They‚Äôre cooked on the stove-top to sweet, buttery perfection with honey, butter, and just a touch of fresh lemon. Great for complimenting both holiday feasts and easy weeknight dinners!\nEnjoy more of my favorite carrot recipes like\nBalsamic Carrots and Honey Roasted Carrots.\nTable of Contents\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a vegetable side dish that both kids and adults will eat, glazed carrots is the way to go! Carrots have a natural sweetness, so kids usually like them. And when you cook them with butter and honey, they truly become irresistible.\nCarrots are full of vitamins and nutrients like beta carotene, fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin K, potassium, and antioxidants. Even cooked butter and honey, carrots still provide great health benefits!\nOur holiday table is not not complete without these beautiful honey glazed carrots. Sometimes I add fun ingredient like lemon, orange, cinnamon, or cayenne pepper. Each additional ingredient takes the flavor of the carrots to a whole new level. Orange or lemon are typically my favorite add-ins, but when I want to add some heat, cayenne pepper is the way to go. Combine cayenne pepper with orange for s spicy orange twist.\nIngredient Notes\nCarrots ‚Äì Be sure to wash and peel the carrots prior to cutting them.\nButter ‚Äì It can be salted or unsalted, whichever you prefer. I recommend using unsalted so you can control the amount of sodium added to the dish.\nOlive Oil ‚Äì If you‚Äôd prefer, you can swap this with avocado oil.\nLemon Juice ‚Äì Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best!\nHoney ‚Äì Try to use a good quality honey for the very best flavor if possible.\nSee recipe card for complete information on ingredients and quantities.\nHow to Make Honey Glazed Carrots\nPrepare the carrots. Wash and peel the carrots. Then, cut them on the bias at about a 45¬∞ angle. Make sure all of the slices are about the same size so they cook evenly!\nCook the carrots. Add olive oil to a pan over medium heat. Add the carrots, season with salt and pepper, and cover the pan. Cook for just about 5 minutes.\nAdd final ingredients. Flip all of the carrots over. Add butter, honey, lemon juice, and parsley. Once the butter melts, stir it all together and let simmer until the carrots are tender. Stir once in a while.\nPRO TIP: You can cook carrots a little softer or a little crunchier, according you your personal taste.\nTips for the Best Honey Butter Glazed Carrots\n- When cutting carrots, make sure that they are as uniform in size as possible to ensure even cooking.\n- If using young carrots, you won‚Äôt need to peel them but wash them and scrub the thin outer layer of the skin.\n- Don‚Äôt overcrowd the pan! This will ensure even cooking and you can get some sear of the carrots if you‚Äôd like.\n- If you want to get some sear on your carrots, let them cook without moving or tossing for about 5 minutes. This will ensure some beautiful browning on the outside.\nAdditional Flavors\n- Feel free to add some nuts like chopped almonds or pecans.\n- If you want to add some seasonal flavor, try fall spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.\n- For those who like a spicy touch, add a pinch of cayenne pepper. The spice will work great with the sweetness of honey.\n- You can finish cooked glazed carrots with a squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of fresh ginger, or squeeze of orange juice.\n- If you want stronger lemon or orange flavor, mix in lemon or orange zest during the last 5 minutes of cooking.\nMake Ahead and Reheating Instructions\nYou can simply wash, peel, and cut carrots ahead of time. Place cut carrots into a zip-lock bag and keep it in the fridge for a day or two before cooking.\nEven though carrots only take about 20 minutes to cook, you can still make them ahead of time. Cook carrots a day ahead and store in a plastic container with an airtight lid.\nTo reheat cooked carrots, you can use a microwave or in a pan on the stove. In a microwave, make sure to reheat them in a microwave-safe container and covered with a microwave lid or another plate. In the pan, reheat over medium heat, covered with a lid, just until heated through.\nRecipe FAQs\nAbsolutely! You can easily use baby carrots to make pan-roasted glazed carrots, but you have to make sure they are close to the same size. This means if you have thick carrots in the mix, you would need to cut them in half, length-wise.\nLet the cooked carrots cool to room temperature before transferring into an airtight storage container. Pop them in the fridge for just 1-2 days before reheating in the microwave or back in the pan.\nThis veggie side dish helps balance heartier main courses like\nLamb Chops and Beef Tenderloin. It also plates well beside entrees like Roast Chicken and Garlic Pork Loin. Since it‚Äôs a sweet side dish, I don‚Äôt recommend pairing it with another sweeter side dish! Think more along the lines of savory sides like Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Mushrooms.\nMore Vegetable Side Dish Recipes\nDID YOU MAKE THIS RECIPE? PLEASE leave a üåü star rating!

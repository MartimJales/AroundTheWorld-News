    "text": "Mark Harmon Is Officially Returning to NCIS — But Not in the Way You Think Since he left DC for Alaska, fans have been awaiting [Mark Harmon coming back to NCIS](https://soaps.sheknows.com/tag/ncis/) and for Gibbs to return as the agency’s fearless leader. Well, more than a year after his exit, Harmon is officially returning to NCIS — but not in the way fans think. NCIS is CBS’ police procedural drama following the special agents of the Naval Criminal Investigation Service’s Major Case Response Team, the United States Navy’s primary federal law enforcement agency, which investigates criminal activity involving the Navy, the United States Marine Corps and their families. Harmon played Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a Supervisory Special Agent at the NCIS, from Seasons 1 to 19. After almost 20 years as a series regular on NCIS, Harmon left the series at the start of season 19. Now with news that [Mark Harmon is coming back to NCIS](https://soaps.sheknows.com/soaps/news/666723/eleanor-bishop-leave-ncis/), fans can’t help but wonder what his grand return will look like. Read on for what we know about Gibbs’ return to NCIS and how Mark Harmon is coming back. Is Mark Harmon coming back to NCIS? Is Mark Harmon coming back to NCIS? The answer is sort of. Deadline reported in January 2024 that an NCIS prequel titled NCIS: Origins about a younger version of Harmon’s character — Leroy Jethro Gibbs — is in the works at CBS. Harmon’s son, Sean Harmon, will play the younger version of Gibbs, while Harmon will narrate the series. Sean also played Gibbs in seven episodes of NCIS from 2008 to 2020. The series will also be produced by NCIS writers and producers NCIS writers-producers, Gina Lucita Monreal and David J. North, as well as CBS Studios, which produces the entire NCIS franchise. NCIS: Origins starts in 1991, years before the events of the original NCIS series. The prequel follows Gibbs as he starts his career as a new special agent at the NCIS Camp Pendleton office and finds his place on a team led by NCIS veteran Mike Franks. (On the original NCIS, Franks was a recurring character played by Muse Watson. He was stabbed to death in Season 8 but continued to appear on the series as a sounding board for Gibbs on difficult cases. The idea for an NCIS prequel originated with Sean Harmon, who approached Monreal, North, and CBS Studios with the idea for the series.“The character of Gibbs has been an important part of my life for 20 years, both in watching my father craft the role and previously having the honor to play young Gibbs myself,” Sean Harmon said in a statement at the time. “I always felt there was a tale worth telling about his earlier years, so I am thrilled to be stepping into a producing role alongside Gina, David and my dad as we tell this story and reveal a new side of this beloved character.” NCIS: Origins also follows another CBS prequel, Young Sheldon, which premiered in 2017 as a prequel of The Big Bang Theory. “We are elated and honored to continue the expansion of the NCIS universe in such a unique and unexpected way,” said Amy Reisenbach, president of CBS Entertainment in a statement. “Viewers can look forward to Mark Harmon returning to CBS to narrate the complex and mysterious backstory of Leroy Jethro Gibbs’ early years in NCIS: Origins, which will build on the rich legacy of this character while reintroducing fan-favorite characters and meeting new ones.” “We are elated and honored to continue the expansion of the NCIS universe in such a unique and unexpected way,” said Amy Reisenbach, president of CBS Entertainment. “Viewers can look forward to Mark Harmon returning to CBS to narrate the complex and mysterious backstory of Leroy Jethro Gibbs’ early years in NCIS: Origins, which will build on the rich legacy of this character while reintroducing fan-favorite characters and meeting new ones.” David Stapf, president of CBS Studios, added, “There’s no denying the cultural and global phenomenon of the NCIS franchise for the last 20 years. When Sean and Mark approached us all with this exciting expansion of the universe – exploring a young Gibbs – we knew it was the next story that needed to be told. We also couldn’t be luckier to have Gina and David at the helm as co-showrunners who are not only brilliant and adept writers but know this character and universe so well.” Before the news of NCIS: Origins, a source told [Closer Weekly](https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/mark-harmon-still-on-the-fence-about-ncis-return/) in July 2023 that Harmon was considering a return as Gibbs before he got sidetracked writing his upcoming book, [Ghosts of Honolulu](https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_soaps?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGhosts-Honolulu-Japanese-American-Hunter%2Fdp%2F1400337011%2F%3Ftag%3Dsoaps0f6-20%26asc_source%3Dweb%26asc_campaign%3Dweb%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsoaps.sheknows.com%252Fsoaps%252Fnews%252F665889%252Fmark-harmon-come-back-ncis%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fsoaps.sheknows.com%2Fsoaps%2Fnews%2F665889%2Fmark-harmon-come-back-ncis%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click). “Mark’s been teasing a return to the show and everyone wanted him back,” the insider said. “He’s still on the fence when it comes to going back to the grind. People wish he would stop getting them excited only to let them down.” The source also claimed that Harmon’s former co-star, Wilmer Valderrama, who has played NCIS Special Agent Nicholas Torres since Season 14, would have mixed feelings about his cast mate’s return. “Wilmer has nothing personal against Mark, but he wouldn’t mind if he never came back,” the insider said. “This has been Wilmer’s time to shine and he feels like he’s finally a main star, not a supporting player.” A source told [Radar Online](https://radaronline.com/p/ncis-star-mark-harmon-backtracking-rejoining-show/) in July 2023 that Harmon’s “fickle attitude” toward coming back to NCIS had stressed his co-stars, who were hoping he’d return to boost the series’ ratings. “Everyone wanted him back,” the insider said. The source also claimed that Harmon is less interested about returning to NCIS now that he’s written his book, Ghosts of Honolulu. “When he was bored, an NCIS return sounded like a good idea. Now he’s found something that’s interesting, he’s less enthused,” the insider said. The source added that Harmon’s cast mates “wish he would stop getting them excited only to let them down.” Rocky Carroll, who plays NCIS Director Leon Vance, also hinted in an interview with [TV Insider](https://www.tvinsider.com/1079341/ncis-episode-450-rocky-carroll-vance-memories-returning-characters/) in January 2023 that Harmon could return in the future. “I think as long as this show stays on the air, there will always be a little bit of a tease that we might see Gibbs again. First time I saw an episode of this show, I said, oh, it’s Gary Cooper from High Noon. Gibbs is the moral compass. He’s the moral compass that we all wish we had,” Carroll said. A source confirmed to [OK magazine](https://okmagazine.com/p/mark-harmon-return-ncis-part-time-save-show/) in September 2023 that Harmon was seriously planning to return to NCIS in a “part-time capacity” to “save the show.” “Mark has to work hard to find things to do at home,” the insider said. “Mark’s had a good long rest, but he’s a little bored doing the same thing day in and day out and would like to get back to the set in a part-time capacity at the very least.” The source continued, “Of course, bosses are thrilled. They’ve been trying to woo him back for some time and Mark can essentially name his price. If anyone can save the show, it’s Mark.” Gibbs left NCIS in Season 19, Episode 4, which saw Gibbs and NCIS Senior Field Agent Timothy McGee travel to Alaska for a case, where Gibbs decides to stay instead of returning to Washington D.C. and resume his career at the NCIS. “My gut’s telling me, I’ll know when I find it,” Gibbs told McGee of what he was looking for in his life. “This sense of peace, I have not had this since Shannon and Kelly died and I’m not ready to let it go.” He then offered his McGee his role at the NCIS. “I could not have hoped for anyone better to watch my back for the past 18 years than you,” he said. In a special featurette for the NCIS season 19 DVD, Harmon hinted that Gibbs was purposely written out of NCIS in a way that doesn’t kill him off so he could return. “I’m not retired… The character is living in Alaska as far as I know,” he said. In a statement to [Entertainment Tonight](https://www.etonline.com/mark-harmon-exits-ncis-in-season-19-173574) after Harmon’s exit in October 2021, NCIS executive producer and showrunner Steven D. Binder also hinted at Gibbs’ return in future seasons. “As an executive producer and dear friend, Mark continues to be an integral part of the fabric of the show. Our north star has always been staying true to our characters, and that truth has always guided the stories we tell and where those characters go,” he said. “So regarding the future of Gibbs, as longtime fans of the show may have noticed over the years… never count Leroy Jethro Gibbs out.” Why did Mark Harmon leave NCIS? Why did Mark Harmon leave NCIS? In a special featurette for the NCIS season 19 DVD, Harmon hinted that he left NCIS after 19 seasons to “keep it fresh” in his career. “What has always drawn me here is the character I play and to keep it fresh and to keep it challenging,” he said. “Plot-wise, this character has taken the path that it did. I thought it was honest and OK with.” Harmon — who was also an executive producer on NCIS from 2008 to 2021 — was officially removed from the NCIS opening credits in Season 20, Episode 1, in September 2022, almost a year after he left the series in season 19. Harmon hasn’t had any new acting roles since he left NCIS, according to his IMDb, which lists NCIS as his most recent acting credit. That could change, however. [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mark-harmon-signs-with-gersh-1235319197/) reported in February 2023 that Harmon had signed with The Gersh Agency, a talent agency that has also represented actors like Brendan Fraser, Allison Janney, Patricia Arquette, Adam Driver and Mandy Moore. Though he’s left NCIS, Harmon is still remembered by his former co-stars. In an interview with [TV Insider](https://www.tvinsider.com/1088476/liza-lapira-ncis-michelle-twist-dead-mole-new-orleans/) in April 2023, Liza Lapira — who played lawyer Michelle Lee on NCIS Seasons 4 an 6 — looked back on a twist that her character was a mole within the agency. “It was great to have that twist. It was a surprise because I had just been written to be the lawyer. I was with the team for a tiny bit, and then I moved into the law portion of NCIS, and then I was going to be Brian [Dietzen]‘s love interest,” Lapira said. “I got a call in [the sixth] season telling me what it was going to be. And it was just really exciting to come back and to get to do a big arc like that.” Lapira also told TV Insider that looking back on NCIS “just brings back a lot of good memories.” She continued, Rocky Carroll is a gem. He’s just a gem. Mark Harmon is. I brought my mom to set, and as a birthday surprise for her, I just told her we were going somewhere, and Mark and Rocky said happy birthday to her and greeted her and just welcomed her with open arms.” She added, “Everyone was really kind. Brian Dietzen, I couldn’t have asked for a better first love interest. He was such a gentleman and very, very welcoming. I remember his wife was pregnant at the time, and it was just like, ‘Hi, nice to meet you. Congratulations. And now let’s pretend to be in love.'” Lapira also told TV Insider what it was like to star on NCIS‘ spinoff, NCIS: New Orleans, in which she played a different character. “I emailed Mark and said, ‘Hey, I’m back at work, kind of.’ That team was lovely, too, and shooting in New Orleans is great. I’m sad that it’s no longer,” she said. NCIS airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on CBS.

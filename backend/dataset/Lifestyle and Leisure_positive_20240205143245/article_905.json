    "text": "AFP – A fruit containing an abudance of minerals, lemon is a top choice to cleanse and recover after the holiday season. Lemon can be consumed in the form of herbal tea, juice or essential oil and is a refreshing ally for detox. The fruit also forms the central component of a weight-loss regime also known as the lemon detox diet. The small, yellow citrus is among the fruits richest in vitamin C (more than 29 milligramme per 100mg). This vitamin contributes to the proper functioning of the immune system and helps reduce fatigue, therefore being known a source of vitality. But this zesty fruit is also known to cleanse the body. These many virtues make lemon a great ally in the aftermath of the festive season. The lemon detox weight-loss diet falls into the category of low-calorie diets. It operates on the principle of reducing the number of calories taken into the body, while consuming lemon juice at regular intervals. Following this diet involves incorporating lemon juice into meals, as a kind of condiment. Red meat, cream and fried foods are prohibited on this regime. These foods bring “bad fat” to the body and promote weight gain. During this detox, your plate will be exclusively composed of foods rich in “good fat”, such as avocado, egg and salmon, and whole foods, such as rice, pasta or legumes. It’s a diet that can be combined with exercise, as long as the diet remains balanced and does not cause deficiencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week (at least half-an-hour per day). For more intense activity, this time should be divided by two. Experts recommend following the lemon detox for 15 to 21 days. Obviously, this method can work differently from one person to another. The most important thing is to listen to your body, and of course, consult a health professional.",

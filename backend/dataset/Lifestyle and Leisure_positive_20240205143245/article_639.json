    "text": "Manchester City boss\nPep Guardiola has produced yet another ‘cheeky’ press conference moment. Pep is known for his antics during media appearances and not taking the media too seriously. He has often provided some vial moments, and this latest one is not for one to ignore.\nPep Guardiola was asked about the fitness schedule of his outcast midfielder\nKalvin Phillips. The English midfielder, bought from Leeds United, has failed to solidify his place at the Etihad. Even during Rodri’s suspension and ban, he could not create a place for himself, signaling a potential transfer away from the club.\nHowever, Guardiola reacted humorously, emulating a crying face when asked about Phillip’s fitness. As Phillips edges closer to a move away from the Etihad, he still will go down as one of the most humble players in the eyes of the fans. After petty moves from players like Angelino, Joao Cancelo, Gabriel Jesus, and\nRaheem Sterling, who wanted to move away from the club following a fallout with the manager.\nMeanwhile,\nManchester City fans have appreciated Phillips’s positive presence in the dressing room while not creating a scene for not featuring after his 40 million euro move from Leeds United. Phillips had recently scored his first goal for City and was cheered massively, signaling how his contribution could be massive for his next club. Kevin De Bruyne has EXCITING message for Manchester City fans as the midfielder is poised for comeback after extended absence\nPotential destinations for Kalvin Phillips after Manchester City\nKalvin Phillips is set to depart Manchester City in January, with both Juventus and Newcastle United expressing interest. Limited playtime under Pep Guardiola has prompted talks about a potential move for the English midfielder. Juventus has initiated negotiations, proposing a loan deal with a buy option, while Newcastle remains a strong contender in the race.\nThe coming weeks promise intrigue as Phillips eyes consistent game time ahead of the European Championships. The potential departure of Kalvin Phillips from Manchester City has garnered attention, with the midfielder seeking a move for more playing opportunities.\nNegotiations are underway, with Juventus proposing a loan deal with a buy option, reflecting Phillips’ openness to a fresh start. Newcastle United, undeterred by rumors, remains a contender for his signature, aligning with the player’s aspirations for regular game time. The upcoming weeks are crucial in determining the destination for one of the sought-after midfielders in the transfer market.\nIn case you missed:\nWATCH: Timothy Weah’s SCREAMER caps off an amazing evening for Juventus in the Coppa Italia Everton boss Sean Dyche urges Premier League to SCRAP winter break, claims gives ‘advantage’ to big clubs Syed Talib Haider",

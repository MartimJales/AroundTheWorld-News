    "text": "The newest franchisees also purchased a location in July of 2023, bringing the total number of franchise units to 11 for the entire franchise network. Tucson, AZ ( [RestaurantNews.com](http://www.RestaurantNews.com)) [Boba Cucue](https://www.bobacutea.com?utm_source=RestaurantNews.com), the rapidly growing boba tea brand known for its expansive selection of boba tea drinks, sweet treats, cute boba tea merch, and fantasy-like atmosphere, has just announced the signing of its second franchise location in the Tucson, Arizona market. The brand’s newest franchise partners, Mike and Sharon Walker, are also the proud owners of a successful Boba Cucue location that launched earlier this summer in Marana. Owner Gary Lo, who owns Boba Cucue together with Vivien Chung, expressed his enthusiasm for this latest franchise agreement. “This newest agreement truly testifies to our team’s ability to provide above-and-beyond support for our franchise partners. When Mike and Sharon started out as franchisees, they were excited to be a part of Boba Cucue’s brand and that excitement grew due to the training and ongoing support we provided to them,” he said. This signing marks the 11th total franchise unit for Boba Cucue, with six different franchise owners already in the franchise family. Lo emphasized that this is just the beginning for the brand. “We have been conducting several Discovery Days for interested franchise buyers, showcasing our wonderful stores and having them sample our delicious drinks and other menu items,” stated Lo. “For Vivien and I, we are dedicated to giving our customers an experience that is family-friendly and memorable; we are hungry to see that happiness in our customers. These Discovery Days really showcase that atmosphere on a tangible level and our potential franchise buyers have taken notice.” The Boba Cucue team has also hinted at several more franchise agreements expected to be finalized soon, indicating the brand’s rapid growth and popularity in the Arizona market and surrounding states. One of the keys to Boba Cucue’s success is its commitment to providing extensive training and unwavering support to its franchise partners from day one, pointed out Director of Franchise Sales Devin Conner. “Gary, Vivien, and the Boba Cucue team’s dedicated support has not only produced a location set up for success, but it has led the new franchisees to buy a second location within 2 months of their first purchase,” he said. “We are excited to say that we are on track to exceed our goals for this year and have great confidence in Boba Cucue for 2024.” Boba Cucue continues to hold Discovery Days and accept applications for new franchise locations nationwide.

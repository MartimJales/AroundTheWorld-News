The magic of this vanilla magic\ncake recipe is that it separates into two layers from one batter when it bakes. Some of my family thought it tasted like bread pudding, some said egg custard and others thought the top layer was like a sponge cake. You can't go wrong with any of those desserts.\nThe shopping list for this magic vanilla cake recipe is simple: eggs, granulated sugar, butter, flour, half and half and vanilla. Egg yolks, sugar and water is beaten together until pale yellow and fluffy, then the melted butter is added. The flour and salt is mixed in followed by the vanilla. Set this mixture aside and beat egg whites until they reach stiff peaks. Fold those egg whites into the egg yolk batter (be gentle!) and pour into a prepared pan. The cake is baked and it will separate into those two gorgeous layers of goodness.\nWe did think it needed a sauce of some kind, so consider serving it with\nbourbon butterscotch sauce, maple caramel sauce or a fruit sauce like raspberry, blueberry or lemon curd.\nNote: 30Seconds is a participant in the Amazon affiliate advertising program and this post contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission or fees if you make a purchase via those links.\nCuisine: American\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\nCook Time: 50 minutes\nTotal Time: 1 hour and 5 minutes\nServings: 12\nIngredients\n- 4 egg yolks\n- 3/4 cup\ngranulated sugar\n- 2 tablespoons cold water\n- 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, melted\n- 3/4 cup\nflour\n- 1/8 teaspoon salt\n- 2 cups whole milk or half and half (I used half and half)\n- 2 teaspoons\nvanilla\n- 4 egg whites, at room temperature\nHelpful Products\n8x8-inch Baking Pan Electric Mixer Measuring Cups Measuring Spoons Whisk Rubber Spatula Stand Mixer Parchment Paper\nRecipe Notes\n- I used half and half to make this cake.\n- Be very gentle when folding in the egg whites so they don't deflate.\nHere's how to make it:\n- Cut two pieces of parchment paper so they fit into the bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan and overlap the edges. Spray the bottom of the pan with nonstick cooking spray, then lay the first piece of parchment paper inside. Lay the second piece going the other way. This will make it easy to remove the cake once baked.\n- Put the egg yolks, sugar and water into the bowl of a stand mixer (you could also use a mixing bowl and handheld electric mixer). Beat until it turns pale yellow and is fluffy, at least 5 minutes. Don't undermix.\n- Slowly add in the melted butter.\n- Stir in the flour and salt. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Pour in the milk and vanilla and mix on low until combined.\n- In another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, about 2 to 3 minutes.\n- Gently fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Do not overmix. You want to leave some unincorporated clumps on the top of the batter.\n- Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.\n- Bake in a preheated 325-degree F oven for about 50 minutes. The top should be golden brown but the center should still jiggle. Cool the cake on the counter until it's at room temperature, then cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours.\nNutrition Facts Per Serving\nCalories: 281\nTotal Fat: 12.9g\nSaturated Fat: 5.6g\nCholesterol: 422mg\nSodium: 82mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 21.6g\nDietary Fiber: 0.2g\nTotal Sugars: 15.9g\nProtein: 10.2g\nVitamin D: 45mcg\nCalcium: 68mg\nIron: 1mg\nPotassium: 147mg\nRecipe cooking times, nutritional information and servings are approximate and provided for your convenience.

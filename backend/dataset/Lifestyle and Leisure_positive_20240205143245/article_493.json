    "text": "Impress your guests with this simple and luxurious Avocado Egg Salad that’s oh-so-easy to make and oh-so-delicious.\nTable of Contents\nCombining your protein-rich eggs with avocados, which are high in carbohydrates and fiber, creates a superfood loaded with healthy fats, a creamy texture and a satisfying taste sensation that is more than the sum of its parts. Adding herbs, onion, and capers completes the flavor profile and elevates this salad from ordinary to extraordinary, whether you use it as a topper for greens or toast.\nMouthfeel can be underrated in creating new simple recipes, but this one is all about the texture of the avocado that takes this egg salad based dish to luxury land.\nIs Avocado Egg Salad Healthy?\nThis Avocado Egg Salad is fairly rich and calorie dense, and a little goes a long way. It contains ample amounts of most of the food groups and is packed with vitamins, minerals and fiber, making it an excellent healthy choice for a filling and satisfying salad. Make it more substantial by serving it on a slice of sourdough toast, or use it to top a\ngreen salad.\nLet’s talk Avocado\nAvocados have been eaten in Central and South America for over 5000 years, though their popularity in Western cuisine only started in the 1970s, when the then exotic “Avocado Pear” was introduced to our tables in fancy restaurants, often paired with heavily dressed steamed shrimp. Avocados quickly gained popularity and became both widely available and reasonably priced in the 1980s and 90s, when the ubiquitous Avocado Toast became the darling of the brunch crowd.\nTheir popularity is understandable – nothing tastes, looks, or has the texture of an avocado, and they are now used far beyond the Mexican guacamole that first made them popular.\nHome cooks have struggled for years with getting avocados to that perfect ripeness, and although there are a few tricks to speed up the process, patience is the one that works best. Placing an avocado in a paper bag with an apple or banana will speed the ripening process somewhat, as will burying it in a pile of raw rice… but the truth is that the best bet for avocado lovers is to buy them regularly and keep them at room temperature. That way, you’ll always have a ripe one, and others ripening in the wings.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 4 Hard Boiled Eggs peeled\n- 1 Avocado\n- ½ small red onion finely diced\n- 1 Tbsp Lemon juice\n- 2 Tbsp olive oil\n- 1 Tbsp Chives chopped\n- 2 Tbsp Radish finely diced\n- 2 Tbsp Parsley finely chopped\n- 1 Tbsp Capers chopped\n- Salt and pepper\nINSTRUCTIONS\nDice\nUse a sharp knife to dice the eggs up until they are about a quarter-inch in size.\nScoop\nCut the avocado in half lengthways and then remove the pip. Use a knife to carefully dice the avocado flesh and then scoop it out with a spoon.\nMix\nPop all of the ingredients into the bowl with the egg and avocado and mix it all together until it is lovely and coated.\nDEVOUR!\nTips and Tricks to Make a Perfect Avocado Egg Salad\n- Unripe avocado won’t yield the results you want, so only make this if you have access to ripe fruits. They should yield under your thumb and the flesh under the stem end should not be bright green.\n- Try a rustic approach by putting the eggs and avocado together in a metal bowl and go at it with a fork or a pastry blender. It’s quite satisfying, and works better than most avocado-specific tools you find at kitchen gadget stores. Even a potato masher works great if you’re making a batch for a crowd.\n- For an even more luxurious texture, reduce the egg boiling time by a minute to yield more runny yolks.\nFAQs\nThat’s a no. Some people recommend wrapping it in plastic wrap and microwaving it, but honestly it doesn’t really work. Your best bet is to let the avocado decide when you get to eat it!\nOnce exposed to air, your salad will start to lose its lovely color. The acid in the lemon juice will slow it down, and refrigerating the salad in a closed container with no air gaps can help. Throwing the avocado pit into the salad while it rests also slows the browning process down.\nMake Ahead and Storage\nFreshness is one of the aspects of this salad that make it so great. You can make it in the morning for that day’s lunch, but it really wont keep any more than 24 hours. The top might still brown, but give it a good stir and top it with a few fresh herbs and dig in. This salad does not freeze well, so I don’t recommend that route.\nIngredients\n- 4 Hard Boiled Eggs peeled\n- 1 Avocado\n- ½ small red onion finely diced\n- 1 Tbsp Lemon juice\n- 2 Tbsp olive oil\n- 1 Tbsp Chives chopped\n- 2 Tbsp Radish finely diced\n- 2 Tbsp Parsley finely chopped\n- 1 Tbsp Capers chopped\n- Salt and pepper\nInstructions\n- Use a sharp knife to dice the eggs up until they are about a quarter-inch in size.\n- Cut the avocado in half lengthways and then remove the pip.

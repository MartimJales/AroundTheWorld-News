    "text": "Trader Joe’s Just Dropped a New “Amazing” Dessert and It’s the Best $5 You’ll Spend All Week\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nThe Trader Joe’s bakery aisle is always stocked with delicious baked goods from bread and muffins to brownies and pies. However, the grocer has always seemed to be lacking in the fresh cookie department. As much as we love our Joe Joe’s, Gluten-Free Chocolate Chunk Cookies, and Crispy Crunchy Peanut Butter Cookies, there’s nothing quite like a treat fresh out of the oven. Luckily, Trader Joe’s just stocked the bakery shelves with a new cookie that we promise will feel like a warm hug in your mouth, perfect for those chilly winter days.\nThe latest Snickerdoodle Cookies are labeled as “soft, chewy, and dusted with cinnamon sugar and are only $4.99. Say no more! The dessert comes after the grocer discontinued the boxed gluten-free soft-baked snickerdoodle cookies after the supplier closed their doors. While this new product does contain gluten, the sugary dessert is being welcomed with open arms and bellies.\nInstagram account\n@traderjoesnew spotted the cookies at their local store and the comments were overflowing with excitement. “OMG I have to get these tomorrow now,” wrote one commenter. Another said, “Oooh sign me UP!!”\nTikToker\nLiz Ballbach, a crew member of Trader Joe’s, also shared a video highlighting employees tasting the new treat, most of them giving it two thumbs up. Ballbach said the treat tastes just like a cinnamon bun and one called the cookies “amazing,” while some mentioned that they would be even better warmed up, but this should go without saying. Another crew member even acknowledged that the cookies are dairy-free, perfect for our vegan friends.\nAs of right now, the cookies are so new that they haven’t even landed on Trader Joe’s website yet. However, see if you can spot them in the bakery aisle next time you head out for groceries. You’ll probably want to snag a box — or two, maybe three.",

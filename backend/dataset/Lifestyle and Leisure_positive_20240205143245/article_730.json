    "text": "Artist Jared Knox, a Marietta native, fondly recalls his first trip to Alabama’s Black Belt during a family hunting trip to Lowndes County when he was a teenager. Perhaps Knox channeled his personal Black Belt history while working on a “Bobcat and Bobwhite,” a 36-by-24-inch acrylic painting on canvas that won Best of Show at the inaugural “Alabama Wildlife Fine Arts Competition” that was part of the second annual Wetumpka Wildlife Arts Festival in November 2023. Knox, a 2021 graduate of Auburn University, created the artwork specifically for the competition. He had been encouraged to enter by Cindy Harris, wife of Alabama Black Belt Adventures Association founder Thomas Harris, who had seen his work at a North Carolina gallery. An avid hunter, Knox said he drew inspiration from his enjoyment of upland hunting and quail conservation while creating “Bobcat and Bobwhite.” He also drew from his personal experience of seeing bobcats in the wild during deer hunting trips to north Georgia. “There was one field that had a bobcat in it, and once or twice I got to see that bobcat hunt,” Knox said. “It was at sunset. That image stuck with me. It was a big bobcat. I love that image, and I also love in general the story of different animals going out and catching their food.” Knox grew up in Marietta and studied mechanical engineering at Auburn. Art remained a hobby during his college years, he said, and he even did some commission work. Then, he was unexpectedly invited to show some of his artwork at a gallery in suburban Atlanta during his final semester at Auburn. He said the encouragement from a gallery owner provided a “light bulb moment” and spurred him to make art, not engineering, into a full-time job. He set up his studio after graduation and has been a full-time artist ever since. The Alabama Black Belt Adventures Association is committed to promoting and enhancing outdoor recreation and tourism opportunities in the Black Belt in a manner that provides economic and ecological benefits to the region and its citizens.

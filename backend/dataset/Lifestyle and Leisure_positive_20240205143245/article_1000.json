    "text": "NEWS RELEASE UNITED WAY SIMCOE MUSKOKA United Way Simcoe Muskoka is launching the Gifts of Warmth 50/50 raffle to raise funds for new program initiatives addressing housing, food security, income stability, and mental health supports across Simcoe, Muskoka, and the Town of The Blue Mountains. “The Gifts of Warmth lottery gives individuals the opportunity to support programs and initiatives that are addressing our community’s most pressing issues,” says Brian Shelley, United Way Simcoe Muskoka chief executive and philanthropy officer. “As an added bonus, you get a chance to win.” Over the next three years, United Way Simcoe Muskoka has committed over $2 million in funding to help launch multi-year collaborative initiatives that support poverty reduction strategies and promote social inclusion; the net proceeds from the lottery will help fund these projects. “This is a true win-win,” added Shelley. The local United Way is building off the success of 50/50 draws it held last summer at Barrie Baycats IBL games; those lotteries saw individuals take home almost $15,000 in winnings. The Gifts of Warmth raffle tickets can be purchased online at [www.rafflebox.ca/raffle/giftsofwarmth](https://www.rafflebox.ca/raffle/giftsofwarmth) up until Feb. 24, 2024. Individuals must be 18 years old and a resident of Ontario to play.",

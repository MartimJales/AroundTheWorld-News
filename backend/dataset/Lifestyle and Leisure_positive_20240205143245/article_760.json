    "text": "SEATTLE — A new bottle shop can help you shake a cocktail or sip champagne without fear of being over-served.\nFamily-run\nCheeky and Dry is stocked with the latest in zero-proof spirits, wine and beer – the first non-alcoholic bottle shop in Seattle.\nThere are also bitters, mixers and other options for creating quality mocktails.\nYura and Kirstin Vracko opened the doors on Nov. 9 and have already needed to re-stock the shelves.\n\"The reception's been insane,” Kirstin said. \"I've had numerous people say, 'I've been sober for 22 years and I've been looking for you, I've been waiting for you.’\"\nThe shop carries bottles made in the Northwest and nationally/internationally. Customers are able to try before they buy at a “tasting station.”\n\"It's nice to have something special, an adult drink,” Yura said.\nThe Vrackos didn't open the business to capitalize on a trend. Cheeky and Dry is their life, in more ways than one.\n\"This whole project started when Yura went to rehab,” Kirstin said.\nIt was May 2023, and his recovery quickly led to better mental and physical health. Kirstin also decided to stop drinking. Combined, they’ve lost roughly 50 pounds.\n“We laugh like we haven't laughed in years. We feel really good,” Kristin said. “No more CPAP, no more blood pressure medication. It's just been life changing.\"\nYura said opening the business has also helped him connect with other people on a similar journey.\n“The thing that gets me is just being part of other people's lives,” he said. \"When you get this room full of people tasting things and trying things, it's just so exciting. We're all headed to a better place of becoming better people or more in touch with life.\"\nBeing part of their immediate community is also important, so they opened the shop in Phinney Ridge - their neighborhood of more than 20 years.\nKirstin said the support they’ve received is incredible. Even the bar across the street has started sending customers their way.\n\"Being part of being able to help each other has been really important and special to us,” Kirstin said.\nCheeky and Dry is located at 6120 Phinney Ave. N. and is open Tuesday – Saturday from noon to 7 p.m.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest.

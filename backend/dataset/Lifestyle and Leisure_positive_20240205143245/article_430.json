    "text": "The Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights are going to the dogs.\nWell, they're getting a dog, and they want your help naming it!\nVGK will be working with America's VetDogs to train a new service dog, according to a release.\nThe dog will eventually be given to a U.S. veteran or first responder with disabilities.\nFirst, though, the seven-week-old male Yellow Labrador Retriever will join the Golden Knights in the coming weeks and spend 16 to 18 months training and socializing with Golden Knights players, staff and fans.\nThe pup will hang out in the VGK front office and attend some events, including events at T Mobile Arena, to familiarize him with different environments and help him become a more confident and calm service dog.\n“Supporting the veterans who have served our country is one of the key pillars that guide the Vegas Golden Knights Foundation,” said VGK Foundation President Kim Frank in a press release . “Working with America’s VetDogs allows us to fulfill that mission in a way that has energized the entire organization. We hope our fans are as excited to meet the new pup as our players and staff are.”\nFans are invited to submit name ideas for the dog online here .",

    "text": "He runs hot and cold, but his capacity to rain down 3-pointers requires constant attention, regardless of the night or conditions around the game.\nWhen shots aren’t falling, Tominaga still draws a quality defender. It remains risky to leave him with a clean look when his on/off switch can flip at any time. And when he heats up, as he did in an 86-70 win over Indiana , NU can blow teams out, propelled forward by an onslaught of 3-pointers that makes life easier on the other four Huskers on the court.\n“It helps everybody when Keisei gets it going like he did, and he just demands so much attention out there, and that’s what gonna open up the pocket pass,” coach Fred Hoiberg said in advance of Nebraska’s game at No. 21 Wisconsin on Saturday. “That’s what’s gonna open up the extra. He hit a couple bombs.”\nPeople are also reading… Dylan Raiola flies in to help Nebraska football's transfer recruiting efforts Nebraska lawmaker to seek ban of Delta-8 sales at attorney general's request Carter Nelson's catch highlights Nebraska football signees at All-American Bowl Minnesota All-American outside hitter Taylor Landfair transfers to Nebraska Lincoln expected to get 5-8 inches of snow Monday, winter storm warning issued A tech billionaire has bought $113 million in Nebraska farmland Nebraska makes first purchase of land in Colorado for proposed canal Amie Just: Predicting 2024 for Nebraska Athletics — and beyond Nebraska football's Nash Hutmacher electrifies in college wrestling debut Icy conditions lead to fatal crash near Lincoln that kills Hickman man Charcuterie chain opens first Nebraska location in Lincoln Driver violated red light in 70th Street and Nebraska Parkway crash, LPD says Alvo couple welcomes first baby of 2024 in Lincoln 44-year-old woman dies in southwest Lincoln crash, State Patrol says Nebraska lawmakers introduce 80 bills, including repeal of abortion, trans care restrictions NU (12-2, 2-1 Big Ten) has found offense from a variety of sources this season, including games in which it pounded opponents down low and won with physicality and effort below the basket. That style of play has been mostly consistent, but Tominaga provided a spark against the Hoosiers. He finished Nebraska’s first game of 2024 with a season-high 28 points on 9-of-15 shooting, including four 3-pointers.\nThe fifth-year senior guard is a threat at any time, balancing Nebraska’s attack and stretching a defense thin.\nSpace opens up. Tominaga’s defender can’t drop to the post for help defense when the ball goes down low. Driving lanes become more available, and Tominaga’s off-ball movement becomes more active as he hunts for his shot. On Wednesday, he scurried around handoffs, looking for the slightest amount of open space to get his shot up, calling for the ball as he cut to a new spot on the perimeter.\n“One of the things that makes Keisei so special is he can have a series of games when he hasn’t been like he was tonight, but the thing is that you can’t ever go into any game thinking, ‘All right, we can kinda game plan around somebody else,’” forward Josiah Allick said Wednesday. “Because as soon as you give him even an ounce of confidence or space, you gotta risk something like tonight happening where he just takes over, and then you’re basically SOL.”\nTominaga’s aggressiveness and the Huskers’ ability to get him the ball with open space will remain important Saturday against a Wisconsin team that plays hard, aggressive defense.\nThe Badgers contained Tominaga for 20 minutes a year ago when they came to Pinnacle Bank Arena. He came alive in the second half and overtime, making four 3-pointers and scoring 17 points as NU erased an 11-point halftime deficit and won 73-63 in overtime. Over the final 10 games of last season, Tominaga averaged 19.4 points and 4.1 3-pointers per game.\nHe missed the first two games of this season with an ankle injury suffered in Nebraska’s preseason exhibition game. His efficiency is down slightly from a year ago, when he made the leap from relatively unheralded junior college transfer to the Huskers’ go-to option in the backcourt. He’s shooting 34% from 3 this season, compared to 40% a year ago.\nIn 2022-23, he was a revelation. That’s not the case anymore, as opponents know what to expect when he steps onto the floor.\nHis ability to change a game hasn’t changed, though. It was on display against Indiana, and it’s an outlet that always has the potential to carry Nebraska.\n“It’s really fun to be out there, just because it’s amazing to watch,” Allick said. “Obviously, it’s fun to watch from the stands, but when you’re huffing and puffing, trying to see where the next one’s gonna come, and then you just see Keisei lob one from 30 feet and it cashes out, you’re like, ‘Oh, thank God.’ Definitely helps you just build momentum out of kind of some very stagnant times during the game.”\nNebraska at No. 21 Wisconsin When/Where: Kohl Center, Madison, Wisconsin, 1:15 p.m.\nTV: Big Ten Network | Radio: 590/1400\nNebraska (12-2, 2-1 Big Ten)\nG - Jamarques Lawrence 6-3 So. 6.8\nG - Brice Williams 6-7 Jr. 13.8\nG - Keisei Tominaga 6-2 Sr. 14.0\nF - Juwan Gary 6-6 Jr. 12.5\nF - Rienk Mast 6-10 Jr. 12.7\nWisconsin (10-3, 2-0)\nG - Chucky Hepburn 6-2 Jr. 8.6\nG - Max Klesmit 6-4 Jr. 7.5\nG - A.J.

To this day she says she hates going into the sitting room because all of the awful memories from that tragic day come flooding back.\n'I genuinely don't like going into the sitting room still, I can still see the hospital bed, it just brings back horrible memories, and it doesn't help with my PTSD,' she said on Thursday.\nRachel Gory is ready to makeover the room Daniel died in. Pic: Rachel Gory Instagram Rachel continued: 'I just don't like the sitting room so a lot of you have actually suggested repainting the sitting room.'\nTop of her to-do list for the sitting room is changing the wood surround for their fireplace because it's raw and unfinished.\nRachel Gory is ready to makeover the room Daniel died in. Pic: Rachel Gory Instagram 'It drives me crazy so I kind of want to get that sorted,' she said adding that she wants to make a few more changes but is at a loss at what to do and has asked her fans for help.\nGiving a glimpse of the room, she explained: 'Like I said whenever I come in here all I see is Daniel's hospital bed and I just have horrible memories in here. I don't come into the sitting room, I don't like it.\nRachel Gorry and her husband Daniel. Pic: Rachel Gorry Instagram 'We spent an awful lot of time in here when Daniel was sick and that's all I see and all I can picture when I'm in here so I would love to just change it up and maybe paint it and anything (suggestions) would be appreciated.'\nRachel summed up her call out by saying that she would like to be able to spend more time in the room. Her planned renovation comes after she created a beautiful bedroom and dressing room in 2023.",

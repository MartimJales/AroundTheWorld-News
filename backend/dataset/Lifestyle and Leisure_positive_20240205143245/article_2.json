Q: Tanya, your journey in the music industry has been remarkable. Can you share the inspiration behind your upcoming single, “Honey,” set to release on February 16, 2024? Tanya Nolan: Absolutely, “Honey” is a song that delves into the depths of desire and passion. I wanted to create something sultry and hot, a musical aphrodisiac that invites listeners to savor the taste of love. The lyrics paint an enticing picture of intimacy, offering a seat at my table where passion and connection intertwine. It’s about indulging in emotions and declaring, “Order what you want on the menu, ’cause I’ve been saving you a seat at my table. Get it off until you are full.” It’s a journey of love sweeter than sugar. Q: Your previous hits, including “Pace Yourself,” “No Pressure,” and the chart-topping “Good Woman,” have resonated with audiences worldwide. How does “Honey” differ from your previous work? Tanya Nolan: Each song I create is a unique expression of my emotions and experiences. While “Honey” shares the raw emotion and soulful delivery that my fans love, it introduces a new level of sensuality.

Tanya Nolan: Being an entrepreneur in the childcare services industry has shaped my perspective on life and love. It’s about nurturing and caring for others, and these themes often find their way into my lyrics. My experiences as a businesswoman and a musician are interconnected, allowing me to bring a unique blend of authenticity to my music. Q: In addition to your musical endeavors, you’re actively involved in mentoring, real estate development, and spending time with your wife. How do these aspects of your life contribute to your creativity and overall well-being? Tanya Nolan: Balancing different aspects of my life keeps me grounded and inspired. Mentoring allows me to connect with younger artists and share my experiences, contributing to the growth of the music community. Real estate development is another creative outlet for me.

    "text": "SOUTH HADLEY, Mass. — The SUNY Cobleskill women’s basketball team opened the 2024 portion of the schedule impressively on Thursday evening mauling the host Lyons of Mount Holyoke College (MHC) 81-38 in non-conference action. With the victory, the Fighting Tigers improved to 11-1 overall on the season to date while the Lyons fell to 1-11 on the year. The Fighting Tigers came out aggressively showing little rust after their winter break racing out to a 43-16 halftime advantage from which they never looked back using defensive pressure to turn over the Lyons 10 times during the stanza which led to 15 points while grabbing 16 offensive rebounds leading to 17 second chance points in the half. Senior center Logan Thayne, of Hoosick Falls, led the Cobleskill attack posting her sixth double/double of the season with game-highs of 20 points and 12 rebounds along with three blocked shots and a pair of assists while junior forward Cara Walker, added 18 points, seven rebounds and two assists on the night. The Orange & Black also received strong outings from junior guard/forward Antonia May, of Amsterdam, with 12 points, six rebounds, three assists, and two blocked shots, and from junior point guard Taylor Meacham, of Berne, who added 12 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals. First-year guard Alyssa Martin, of Castleton, was also a factor off the bench for the Fighting Tigers with five points, two rebounds, and an assist. Cobleskill will return to North Atlantic Conference (NAC) play on Tuesday, Jan. 9 when they host the Wildcats of the SUNY Polytechnic Institute for a conference contest at the Iorio Gymnasium beginning at 7:30 p.m.",

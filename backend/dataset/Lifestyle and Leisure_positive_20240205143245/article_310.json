    "text": "Whether you’ve got antsy kids at home or in the classroom, a good board game can keep the little ones entertained for hours — not to mention help strengthen their critical-thinking skills. So while we’ve written before about all sorts of games and activities in the past — including the best four-player board games , two-player board games , and board games for adults — here, we’ve rounded up the 21 best board games for kids.\nBest strategy board game for kids\nTicket to Ride $55 now 20% off $44 Ticket to Ride is an adventure-style game in which players attempt to cross the country and connect cities by building train routes. Suitable for ages 8 and up, it is easy to pick up “but also offers a level of strategy and tactics just deep enough for competitive gamers to return to time and again,” says Ian Ross, who runs the popular Instagram page Board Games As Art .\n$44 at Amazon Buy Best pick-and-pass-style card game for kids\nSushi Go! $12 For a lightning-quick, pick-and-pass-style card game, Lauren Bilanko, a co-owner of Twenty Sided Store , suggests Sushi Go! , which she says is very easy to learn but still fun enough to play over and over again. The gameplay is simple: collect cards to create collections of dishes for different point values, and whoever scores the most points wins.\n$12 at Amazon Buy Best farming-style board game for kids\nTakenoko $47 Illustrator Stephen Walsh told us about this “really sweet” game about competitive panda husbandry that’s a favorite of his kids. It asks players to cultivate land plots and grow three species of bamboo for pandas. Walsh describes it as the “perfect Christmas Day game” to break out when you want something family-friendly and cheerful. The game takes about 45 minutes to play and is suitable for ages 8 and up.\n$47 at Amazon Buy $42 at Walmart Buy Best building-focused board game for kids\nMouse Trap Board Game $25 Most ’90s kids will remember this classic, which is suitable for children ages 4 and up and can accommodate two to four players. “Nothing could beat being a kid and unboxing this game to build a wacky Rube Goldberg machine,” says board-game designer Rob Sparks .\n$25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy Best family-friendly word-association board game\nJust One $25 In our roundup of the best board games to break out during parties, five of our experts praised Just One . “Hands down, Just One is our favorite new party game,” says Kelsey Demers, who runs the board-game blog the Tabletop Family . “It’s simple to play, a breeze to teach, and utterly addictive.” The game won the prestigious 2019 Spiel des Jahres, or German Game of the Year, which evaluates board games based on their game concept, rule structure, layout, and design. The main objective, as the title suggests, is for players to help their teammates guess a word by suggesting “just one” word as a hint. Which sounds easy enough, but, as Matthews warns, “Watch out, duplicate words cancel each other out,” so you need to be creative. A right answer scores your team one point, while a wrong answer docks two points, with the ultimate goal being to get as many points out of 13 as possible. This game takes about 20 minutes to play and is suitable for up to seven players.\n$25 at Amazon Buy Best storytelling board game for kids\nDixit $40 now 15% off $34 Walsh describes Dixit as “a great icebreaker of a game, fantastic for getting everyone interacting.” Great for kids with strong imaginations, it begins with one player being designated the storyteller; that player makes up a sentence based on the image on one of the cards in their hand. Then each player selects the card in their hand that best matches the sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller shuffles the cards and presents them to the other players, who place bets on which is the original card with the winners gaining points for correct guesses. As an added bonus, “the card artwork is beautiful, imaginative, and sometimes a little surreal,” Walsh says.\n$34 at Amazon Buy Best bingo-style board game for kids\nThinkFun Zingo! $20 $20 Recommended by longtime Manhattan nanny Kasia Dabrowska, this bingo-esque game is easy to teach kids because the name of the game is speed-spotting familiar items like a dog, bird, or baseball bat. Strategist contributor and father of two Steven John also keeps it in rotation with his family.\n$20 at Amazon Buy Best whodunit-style board game for kids\nOutfoxed! $22 now 9% off $20 “ Outfoxed has more replay value than I have ever experienced in a child’s board game,” says John. For months after first getting the game, his then-5-and-a-half-year-old requested a round nearly every single day, he adds. A classic whodunit, the game’s kids discover a series of clues and a group of suspects, zeroing in on the guilty fox through a process of elimination.\n$20 at Amazon Buy Best nostalgic board game for kids\nOperation $20 Similar to Mousetrap , Operation was beloved by ’90s kids. Walsh told us that while he loved this game when he was young, he also enjoyed playing it when he was older with his friends after a night out. The whole family can sit down and operate on Cavity Sam to remove his various ailments — including his wishbone, charley horse, and Adam’s apple — without setting off the buzzer.\n$20 at Walmart Buy Best balancing board game for kids\nMelissa & Doug Suspend Family Game (31 pcs) $23 now 30% off $16 For kids who love to build things, this game asks players to build a shifting tower by adding pieces. The game can accommodate up to four players, which encourages socialization and “very important” peer interaction, explains child therapist Glenda Stoller, co-founder of Village Parenting NYC .\n$16 at Amazon Buy Best board game kids can play with friends\nConnect 4 Spin Game $22 now 23% off $17 Colleen Russo Johnson , a children’s-tech and media expert, recommends this remix of the original Connect 4 game, which requires a bit more strategy. In addition to placing their pieces in a slot, players must spin the corresponding column, which keeps gameplay interesting.\n$17 at Amazon Buy Best card-slash-board game for kids\nSorry! $22 now 14% off $19 “I was really surprised at how it held up,” says clinical child psychologist George Sachs . Fourth-grade teacher Courtney Caulfield adds that the kids in her class also love the throwback. “They like it because they can play with friends,” she says. “And it usually makes them think.”\n$19 at Amazon Buy $12 at Walmart Buy Best active board game for kids\nThrow Throw Burrito $25 $25 Anya Kamenetz , mother of two and author of The Art of Screen Time , recommends the fast-paced Exploding Kittens game Throw Throw Burrito , “which is a fun combination of goofiness and actual strategy.” Gameplay is only 15 minutes and can accommodate two to six players. Toy blogger and reviewer Lori Jepsen of Toysenberry is also a fan. “ “I mean, what’s not to love about throwing burritos at your siblings or parents or spouse?”\n$25 at Amazon Buy Best party game for kids\nCodenames $25 now 32% off $17 According to Strategist contributor and dad David Pogue , “this is the greatest game ” that all ages can play. The rules of this spy-themed favorite are very similar to the basic elements of charades, with players dividing into two teams with one designated spymaster, who provides clues. By guessing the words correctly, players unveil the other teams’ agents. The first to unmask all of its opponents’ spies wins. Pogue calls it “truly hilarious and satisfying,” and though the designer has it labeled for kids 10 and up, Pogue notes that “ Codenames is super-fun with younger kids because they make fantastically imaginative connections between the words.”\n$17 at Amazon Buy Best board game for kids who like breaking rules\nMonopoly Cheaters Edition $35 This edition of Monopoly is designed for cheaters: The goal is to see how many rules you can bend or break in order to win. “Isn’t that the way every kid plays all the time anyway?” says Zibby Owens, mother of four and host of Moms Don’t Have Time to Read Books . The game “encourages secret bank thefts, secret property swipes, and serious consequences if caught,” Owens adds.\n$35 at Amazon Buy Best fast-paced game for kids\nDrone Home Board Game $14 $25 now 44% off $14 Ideal for kids ages 10 and up, this fast-paced board game’s main objective is to be the first to help all of your aliens escape into outer space via drone. Suitable for two to four players, “it’s the first game I’ve ever seen with a real flying drone,” says Adrienne Appell of the Toy Association , who recommends it because it “combines different kinds of play for a lot of fun.”\n$14 at Amazon Buy Best planning board game for kids\nSmartGames Smart Farmer Board Game $25 This farm-animal-themed board game “challenges kids to really think about each move,” says NAPPA Awards director Elena Epstein. The game’s main objective had kids create a layout for a series of cows, pigs, and other farm animals that must be kept separated using a limited number of fences, which tests a child’s logic, spatial reasoning, and planning skills. “Kids feel a lot of pride as they figure out each level,” Epstein says.\n$25 at Amazon Buy Best tic-tac-toe–inspired board game\nOtrio Board Game $40 This tic-tac-toe inspired board game is “visually appealing” and “complex,” according to Sophia W., a nanny for the New York–based SmartSitting agency. Even better, Sophia says, “It’s well suited for gifted and special-needs children, as the colors stimulate kids who think visually.”\n$40 at Amazon Buy Best 3-D board game for kids\nTetris Head-to-Head Multiplayer Strategy Game $20 now 20% off $16 This 3-D Tetris game, recommended by Ali Mierzejewski, the editor-in-chief of the Toy Insider, works much like the original version of the game except you’re competing against other players using one pot of physical pieces. “You have to be strategic about what pieces you need and try to predict what the other players will need while playing. It’s a really fun way to update the classic video game,” she says.\n$16 at Amazon Buy Best dice board game for kids\nYahtzee $9 A tried-and-true for a reason, Yahtzee is “easy to teach, with minimal setup, and suitable for any number of players,” says Sparks. “This absolute classic will have players pushing their luck to roll high-scoring combinations of dice.” Most important, Yahtzee is fast-paced, so it will keep kids engaged throughout the gameplay.\n$9 at Amazon Buy $8 at Target Buy Best cooperative survival-style board game for kids\nForbidden Island – The Cooperative Strategy Survival Island Board Game $21 $21 Collaborative games are great because they teach kids teamwork skills as they work together toward a common objective. Caitlin Meister, founder of the Greer Meister Group , a private-tutoring and educational -consulting practice in Brooklyn, recommends Forbidden Island , in which players have to work together to get off an island before it sinks into the ocean. “You reassemble the board each time by laying out tiles, so it doesn’t get boring,” she says. It has plenty of replay value.\n$21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy Best board game for little kids\nPeaceable Kingdom Monkey Around $22 If you’re struggling to find games for very little kids, try Monkey Around . “It’s like Twister for toddlers,” explains Holly Magelof, toy buyer for the Dolphin Bookshop , which she says is very popular among the toddler set. “You see the kids wiggling and giggling — it’s consistently a best seller.”\n$22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Target Buy Best challenging board game for kids\nRichard Scarry’s Busytown, Eye Found It Game $25 “My 4-year-old, a huge fan of Richard Scarry books, loves playing this game,” says Strategist writer Lauren Ro, whose son Augie received the gift for his latest birthday. It’s sure to be a hit for any kids who demand a Scarry book before bed since it’s basically the board-game version of Busytown. The objective seems simple: Players work together to race to the island before the picnicking pigs eat all their food. But, Ro says, “it’s actually pretty challenging, even for adults” because, depending on what you spin, you either advance or go on a scavenger hunt to collect different objects on the highly detailed, six-foot board. “Augie relishes the challenge and gets really excited each time he plays,” she adds.\n$25 at Macy's Buy Best travel-size board game for kids\nSpot It! Animals Junior Card Game $10 Spot It! is a matching card game in which kids try to find two identical images between two cards first. Since it’s small enough to fit in your hand, it’s a great game to keep in your purse for doctors’ waiting rooms or long car rides. This one is animal-themed, but the game comes in a bunch of different variations, including favorite IP like Frozen and Paw Patrol .\n$10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy Best math-focused board game\nAdsumudi Math Game $18 $18 For something more educational, try this math game that was featured in our gift guide for 8-year-olds. To win a card, players have to get to the center number by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the five other numbers on the card (each number can be used only once). The first player to collect five cards is crowned the winner. While the game is designed for kids ages 8 to 12, each player starts the game by choosing their own level of difficulty, meaning kids of different skill sets can all play together.\n$18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy",

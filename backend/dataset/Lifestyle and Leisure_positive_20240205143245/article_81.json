    "text": "A grand entourage of 500 people, 13 floats, four music bands and incredible shows accompanied the Kings in the annual Almeria Parade on January 5. During the Parade the Three Magic Kings threw out 13,000 kilos of candy during their tour of the city centre, that passed through Puerta de Purchena, Paseo de Almeria, Plaza Emilio Perez, Avenida Federico Garcia Lorca, ending at the Rambla Amphitheater.\n Three Kings in Mojacar The search for a missing man in Almeria Nijar welcomes the first female police officer in its history It was a spectacular parade, with joy, emotions and thousands of sweets. The pleasant sound of the musical groups Banda Municipal de Almeria, Banda Santa Cruz, Banda de la Agrupacion Musical San Indalecio and Banda del Carmen filled the streets. The Scouts of Almeria were also on show, as they accompanied the Kings on their own special float.\nFive different shows were performed by international companies from France, Italy, Belgium and Spain, where lighting, giant characters and surprises delighted both children and adults.\nThe Council of Almeria prepared every detail to make it a safe parade, with about six kilometres of fences, so that the route was perfectly fenced and closed to anyone outside the procession and the participation of members of the Local and National Police.\n Jennifer Popplewell Jennifer is a proud northerner from Sheffield, England, who is currently living in Spain. She loves swimming in rivers, talking to the stars and eating luxurious chocolate.\nComments",

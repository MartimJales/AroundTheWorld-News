    "text": "Ahead of their Week 18 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, the San Francisco 49ers saw nine players be named to the Pro Bowl, the most of any NFL team. On the offensive side of the ball, quarterback Brock Purdy, fullback Kyle Juzczyk, running back Christian McCaffrey, tight end George Kittle, and left tackle Trent Williams were all selected. On the defensive side of the ball, defensive end Nick Bosa, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave, linebacker Fred Warner, cornerback Charvarius Ward were selected. Of the nine players, only Hargrave was listed as a backup. In our latest podcast episode, we discussed the 49ers’ Pro Bowl selections, pointing out potential snubs, while breaking down each of their seasons. The video for the show is embedded above, while the audio is available below. You can listen to The Rohan Chakravarthi Show on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rohan-chakravarthi-show/id1665472154), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5djyS54CaCbFCJdy7wUTmV), or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@rohanchakravarthi7828). At quarterback, Brock Purdy was a fan-vote leader, but his MVP-esque season led him to be the NFC’s starter at the position. McCaffrey, another player who was in MVP conversations at times this season, was the leader at running back, with Philadelphia’s D’Andre Swift and Los Angeles’s Kyren Williams backing him up. George Kittle has arguably been the league’s best tight end this season, which is why it made sense that he made the Pro Bowl as a starter, with Detroit Lions rookie Sam LaPorta backing him up. Defensively, one of San Francisco’s two top defensive tackles made the Pro Bowl, as Javon Hargrave was the third player selected behind stars Dexter Lawrence and Aaron Donald. In the secondary, Charvarius Ward earned his Pro Bowl, as he was named a starter alongside Dallas’s DaRon Bland. Ward has been excellent this season, leading the league in pass deflections, while recording several interceptions over the past few weeks. [While the 49ers certainly got their praise with nine selections, one notable omission was wideout Brandon Aiyuk, who was not one of the four NFC receivers selected.](https://www.ninersnation.com/2024/1/4/24025463/kyle-shanahan-brock-purdy-nick-bosa-49ers-playoff-picture)",

    "text": "Forsyth County man marries couple at Vegas Kelly Clarkson Concert CUMMING, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - If Kelly Clarkson’s music had a message, it is love, what it feels like to experience it, lose it, fear it. “Oh, it is tonight!? With me?” said Kelly Clarkson to Brian Artzt, in a video taken by a concertgoer. That music has always had the hearts of two men who fell in love more than a decade ago. So much so that they were engaged at a Kelly Clarkson concert. “It was March 16th, 2019 at her Meaning of Life tour,” said Brian. And recently at her show in Vegas, decided to tie the knot. “We refuse to get married until you’re by our side,” said Brian to Clarkson in a video taken by a concertgoer. This is where Phil Beniamino comes in. “Is anyone an officiant?” said Kelly Clarkson in a video taken by a concertgoer. “YES! YES!” said Phil in the video. She looks around the crowd and picks Phil, a Georgia man from Forsyth County. “It is good to see people who are in love,” said Phil. “We gather here today at Kelly Clarkson’s show,” said Phil in a video shot by concertgoers, “with two gentlemen who want to proclaim their love tonight, forever. What is your name?” “Love is love and love is real,” said Brian. Phil, Brian and Brian’s partner Marcello are friends now. “It was destiny that he was a part of it,” said Brian. There is shock that a wedding would happen at a concert, that an artist would go out of her way to make it happen. There is the support from a room full of people for two men they don’t know but cheered on like it was a wedding of their close friend. There is also a reminder that love can show up in the most unexpected ways, if people are just ready to make space for it. “It was almost breathtaking to see the support and congratulations people were sending us from around the world,” said Brian. “I think it does create hope that if you dream it, you can become it,” said Phil.

    "text": "[The Xperience Kitchen + Lounge](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550984592604), a soul food restaurant and cocktail lounge, had its grand opening on Friday, Dec. 29 in the former 109 & Co. space at 109 Main St. in downtown Little Rock, a few blocks south of the Statehouse Convention Center. Owner Bobby Forrest Jr., a Little Rock-based criminal defense attorney, said in a September interview that he’s wanted to open a restaurant for a few years and took inspiration from the Houston food scene after attending law school there. Forrest said renovations to 109 & Co., which closed in August, included brightening the space and adding a full-service kitchen. Rhett Brinkley Forrest described [ the menu](https://www.thexperiencelr.com/menu) as a Southern-style Cajun mix with a luxury twist. Appetizers include wings, crab cakes, fried pickles, fried salmon bites and two types of egg rolls (Buffalo and Philly Cheese). Price points on entrees range from $18-$32, with options like fried chicken, fried or blackened catfish, fried pork chops, shrimp tacos, salmon tacos, blackened salmon and fried lamb chops. A $75 surf-and-turf dish features lamb chops and lobster tail. The menu of $5 sides include greens with turkey, cabbage, mashed potatoes, yams, mac and cheese, French fries and fried okra. Forrest said the restaurant will be offering brunch from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on Saturdays and all day on Sundays. The brunch menu is similar to the dinner menu, but it also includes chicken and waffles (classic or red velvet), catfish and grits, lobster tail and grits or shrimp and grits or fried crab legs and grits. The restaurant will offer a late night menu weekend nights from 10 p.m.- 1 a.m that features wings with fries, catfish with fries or egg rolls. Forrest said he was impressed with executive chef Christopher Jones’ food after previously hiring him for a catering event.“ We ran into each other at 109 & Co. funny enough, and I told him I wanted to buy this location, and when it happened I called him up,” Forrest said. Xperience also has several signature cocktails ranging from $16-18 and a “Bougie on a Budget” menu featuring five $10 cocktails. Four flavors of mimosas are on the menu, which can be ordered by the glass or in self-dispensing mimosa towers for the table. Xperience is 21-plus, and there is an 18% gratuity charge on all checks. Its hours are from 4-10 p.m. Wed.-Thu.; 4 p.m.-1 a.m. Fri; 11 a.m.-1 a.m. Sat.; 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Sun. [Reservations can be made here](https://book.easytablebooking.com/book/?id=a5e97&lang=auto).",

Known as much for his standalone stories as for the beloved Myron Bolitar series, the 62-year-old has earned plenty of acclaim – even becoming the first author to win the Edgar Award, the Shamus Award and the Anthony Award.\nCoben has also adapted several of his novels into Netflix thrillers. The latest,\nFool Me Once, came out on 1st January and stars Michelle Keegan, Richard Armitage and a full cast of stellar British actors.\nSo, whether you’ve stumbled upon Harlan Coben for the first time this New Year, or you’ve watched his shows for years but have yet to pick up one of the sacred texts, we’ve put together a list of 10 top novels to try.

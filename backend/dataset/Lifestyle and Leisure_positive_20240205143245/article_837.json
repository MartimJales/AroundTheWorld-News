    "text": "As New Year’s resolutions take off, a significant chunk of Americans will attempt to either cut down their alcohol intake or stop drinking entirely.\nCommonly known as “Dry January,” some people use the first month of the year to participate in a trend of avoiding alcohol consumption and instead embrace sobriety.\nBetween 15% to 19% of Americans partake in Dry January every year, according to research out of market research firm Morning Consult.\nGiven its widespread popularity, influencers, content creators and medical experts are taking to social media platforms to talk about Dry January, how they plan to implement it and what health benefits they expect to see.\nHow Dry January affects the body\nDry January advocates point to some key effects that come with abstaining from benefits, including improved sleep, energy, focus and skin health. Additionally, – over time – some people experience fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nDr. Jennifer Ashton, a physician and TV personality who’s perhaps most well-known as ABC News and Good Morning America’s chief medical correspondent, recently posted on her Instagram about what she dubs “Dry Jen-uary.”\nAshton detailed how she first tried the trend back in 2015 when she realized the longest she had ever gone without alcohol was when she was pregnant.\n“To me, it was a curiosity wellness challenge, and I did it – I found it very easy, and loved how I felt,” she noted. “It makes me feel more mindful.”\nAshton noted that moderate drinkers may benefit the most, as even just having one margarita at lunch can result in overall malaise.\n“If you really pay attention to the effects of alcohol, you feel not great,” she said.\nHowever, she cautioned against alcoholics or people with alcohol abuse issues from trying it – as going cold turkey without medical support can result in life-threatening withdrawal symptoms.\n“I want to be clear what it’s not: It’s not for people who have alcohol dependence or sobriety issues, or alcohol abuse issues,” Ashton said. “We’re not talking about going dry for those reasons.”\nOther influencers, such as psychiatrist Daniel Amen – who has 2.5 million followers on\nTikTok – have discussed the negative impact of alcohol on mental health as a reason to give Dry January a try.\nIn a video posted at the start of the month, Amen noted that alcohol may provide people with a short-term benefit where you forget your problems only for them to come back. Amen advocated for his audience to give Dry January a shot and to instead work on their issues in therapy.\nHealthcare brands go dry\nBrands linked to mental health, sobriety and alcohol-free beverages have also hopped on the trend.\nAlex George, a mental health advocate and co-founder of men’s mental fitness app Mettle, shared his personal experience going sober last year – which has extended to a full year.\n“I didn’t drink a drop of alcohol in 2023 and it changed my life entirely,” he wrote in the post. “I am SO much more at peace, more confident, happier, productive, fitter, healthier and so much more since I went alcohol free. If you are considering going [alcohol free], whether it’s for January or the whole of 2024, this is your sign.”\nOther influencers who focus on diet and nutrition are hopping onto the trend by sharing delicious alcohol-free mocktail recipes, to assist people in scratching the itch for a tasty beverage during their sober month.\nTikToker Mereana posted one Dry January spicy grapefruit paloma mocktail recipe at the start of the month, which involves lime juice, grapefruit juice, crushed jalapenos and plenty of other tasty but healthy elements.\nGo damp instead of dry\nStill, for people who may not want to go entirely alcohol free, fear not – there are other trends that might fit better with their New Year’s goals.\nOne recent TikTok trend, the “One Week No Booze” method, involves going sober for one week at a time to cut down on weekly drinks.\nCheekily called “Damp January,” another trend involves reducing overall alcohol intake to a much healthier amount – as opposed to cutting it out entirely. Damp January offers a more balanced approach to people who still like to imbibe every so often, such as during social occasions.\nDamp January advocates say it gives them some more leeway to have a couple drinks here and there, especially at inevitable events like birthdays or celebrations.\nDamp January also helps people simply “reset” post-holidays, as cutting down overall alcohol intake can make it easier to stick to other New Year’s resolutions like going to the gym – without the overwhelming commitment that Dry January may entail.",

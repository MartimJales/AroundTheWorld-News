Sometimes, these goals are easier to achieve based on location, as some U.S. residents face hurdles beyond their control, such as affordable gyms, and a lack of access to parks and sidewalks. A new study [conducted by WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-cities-for-an-active-lifestyle/8817) compared the top 100 biggest U.S. cities and ranked the best and worst for an active lifestyle.

    "text": "MATTOON â€” Lottie Taylor Markwell of Mount Zion has become the first baby to be born in 2024 at Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center, arriving early Wednesday morning three days into the new year. Lottie, who weighed 6 pounds, 8 ounces and measured 21 inches tall at birth, is the daughter of Adam and Maggie Markwell. Her father grew in Greenup in Cumberland County and her mother was raised in Mattoon in Coles County. Adam Markwell said they moved to Mount Zion in May so that he could take a job with the Illinois State Police in Decatur, but they opted to seek pregnancy care from Sarah Bush Lincoln in his wife's hometown due to the proximity to extended family there. \"We thought it would be easier with childcare,\" Adam Markwell. The couple also has another child, 2-year-old Charles. That proximity was particularly helpful after Maggie Markwell's contractions started overnight Tuesday. Adam said they were able to drop off Charles with her parents, Jeff and Melissa Price in Mattoon, on the way to the health center. In addition, Adam Markwell said they arranged ahead of time for his parents, Dennis and Jennifer Markwell, to pick up the family dog, a Golden Retriever named Chester, in Mount Zion and watch after him while they were in the hospital. Adam Markwell said the staff at Sarah Bush Lincoln's Women & Children's Center had prepared them for the possibility of a crowded labor and delivery wing, but his wife ended up being the only patient there that night. They had the medical staff to themselves for a while. \"Everyone was wonderful. We are glad to have a healthy baby,\" said Maggie Markwell, who worked as a nurse at the St. Louis Children's Hospital and is now focusing on being a stay-at-home mother. She and her husband said they knew Lottie might be the first baby of 2024 at Sarah Bush Lincoln but were pleasantly surprised when this was the case. Maggie Markwell said Lottie was born with \"dark hair, lots of it.\" Her husband said in regard to the color of the sleepy baby's eyes that, \"We have not seen too much of them, but they are blue.\" Adam Markwell said they had to \"warm (Charles) up to the idea of having a little sister,\" but he seemed to have an emotional connection to Lottie as soon as he saw her in the hospital room. Maggie said Charles kissed the newborn on the head, gave her a light hug, and later cried when she cried. \"(Charles) seems like he is going to be a good big brother for her,\" Adam Markwell said.

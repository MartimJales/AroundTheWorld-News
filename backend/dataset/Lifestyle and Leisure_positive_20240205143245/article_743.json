    "text": "One-Pan Baked Greek Chicken Recipe With Lemon Rice Is Fantastic by Donna John\n[Greek Recipes](/food/category/greek-recipes/) [Poultry](/food/category/poultry/) [Dinner](/food/category/dinner/) [Cookbooks](/food/category/cookbooks/) [Like\nLike tip\nYou liked\n](/food/tip/65232/like) [Comments\nAdd comment\n](#comments) [Collections\nAdd to collection\nIn collection\n]()\nMagi Maehashi, the creator of this recipe, says it is \"the best chicken and rice recipe in the world.\" She admits it's not an \"authentic Greek dish,\" but it does use classic\nGreek ingredients. I have to agree with Magi that this is a pretty spectacular one-pot baked chicken dinner.\nThis is another winning recipe from my favorite cookbook,\nRecipeTin Eats Dinner by Magi Maehashi. To make this easy Greek-inspired\nbaked chicken recipe you will need bone-in chicken thighs, fresh lemons for juicing and zesting, dried oregano, fresh garlic, salt and black pepper, olive oil, onion, long-grain rice and chicken broth. The recipe starts on the stovetop and ends in the oven, so you will need an ovenproof skillet.\nServe this Greek chicken for\ndinner with your favorite side dishes. It's pretty much a meal on its own, but I added a fresh garden salad on the side.\nNote: 30Seconds is a participant in the Amazon affiliate advertising program and this post contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission or fees if you make a purchase via those links.\nCuisine: Greek\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\nCook Time: 50 minutes\nTotal Time: 1 hour\nServings: 5\nIngredients\nChicken and Marinade\n- 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n- 1 - 2 lemons, for zesting and juicing (about 4 tablespoons juice)\n- 1 tablespoon\ndried oregano\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)\nLemon Rice\n- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (divided)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 1 cup\nlong-grain rice(uncooked)\n- 1 1/2 cups\nchicken broth\n- 3/4 cup water\n- 1 tablespoon\ndried oregano\n- 3/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)\n- black pepper, to taste\n- fresh parsley or oregano, for garnish (optional)\n- fresh lemon zest, for garnish (optional, but recommended)\nHelpful Products\nRecipeTin Eats Dinner Le Creuset Cookware Tongs Lemon Juicer Cutting Board Chef Knife Measuring Cups Measuring Spoons Skillet Cast Iron Skillet Grater Aluminum Foil Pepper Grinder\nRecipe Notes\n- I put my chicken in the marinade in the morning so it marinated all day.\n- I used my Le Creuset round baking dish to make this recipe, but any oven-proof pan with a lid would work. If you don't have a lid, cover with aluminum foil.\n- I put the spent lemons into the bag with the marinade and added lemon slices to the top before baking.\nHere's how to make it:\n- Combine all the marinade ingredients in a plastic zipper bag or shallow dish. Cover and marinate 20 minutes to overnight in the refrigerator.\n- When ready to cook, remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade in the bag). Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Put the chicken into the skillet skin side down and cook until golden brown. Flip it over and cook the other side to golden brown (it will not be cooked through at this point). Remove the chicken to a plate.\n- Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 2 to 3 minutes.\n- Add the rice, chicken broth, water, dried oregano, salt, pepper and reserved marinade.\n- Stir to combine the ingredients and bring to a simmer.\n- Put the chicken back into the skillet. Cover the skillet and bake in a preheated 350-degree F oven for about 35 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to bake for about 10 more minutes or until all the liquid has absorbed and the rice is tender.\n- Remove from the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with parsley, oregano and fresh lemon zest, if desired.\nNutrition Facts Per Serving\nCalories: 495\nTotal Fat: 38.1g\nSaturated Fat: 6.8g\nCholesterol: 58mg\nSodium: 151mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 22.7g\nDietary Fiber: 2g\nTotal Sugars: 2g\nProtein: 18.4g\nVitamin D: 0mcg\nCalcium: 38mg\nIron: 2mg\nPotassium: 285mg\nRecipe cooking times, nutritional information and servings are approximate and provided for your convenience.

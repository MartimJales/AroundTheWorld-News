    "text": "“That’s so fetch!”\nFans of the hit film Mean Girls will remember teen royalty Regina George’s (Rachel McAdams)\nenormous house, where she famously introduced Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) to the Plastics’ Burn Book.\nWell, the breathtaking, nine-bedroom, 14-bathroom home featured in the film was put on the market in 2022 and is still for sale.\nThe home, located on High Point Road in The Bridle Path, was initially listed for a cool $27 million. It has since been reduced twice, first to $23.8 million, then again to its current price point of $19,995,000, according to The Toronto Star.\nMean Girls fans will recall exterior shots of the home’s lavish facade, as Regina George and the Plastics pull up to the front door in her convertible.\nThe listing describes the house as having a “soaring cathedral reception hall,” and “18,276 sq. ft. of living space as well as a detached coach house suite.”\nThe house also boasts staff quarters, a gym, spa and swimming pool, a tennis court, heated floors, a billiards table, a total of 26 parking spots and four additional below-grade bedrooms – on top of the above-grade nine.\nA musical remake of Mean Girls is set to hit movie theatres on January 12, unfortunately, Regina’s iconic house didn’t cut.",

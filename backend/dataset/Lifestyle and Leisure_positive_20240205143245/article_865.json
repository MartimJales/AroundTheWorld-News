    "text": "There’s been a fair share of NFL players who paid up for miscellaneous wagers on college football during the regular season. For Dolphins wide receiver Jaylen Waddle , he made one with his team president — and it meant he had to wear Michigan gear during Friday’s media availability. Waddle wore a UM hat and sweatshirt while meeting with reporters yesterday after Monday’s Rose Bowl, which his Alabama Crimson Tide lost in overtime to Tom Garfinkel’s Michigan Wolverines. Waddle starred at Alabama before the Dolphins drafted him No. 6 overall in the 2021 NFL Draft , helping lead the Crimson Tide to a national championship in 2020. This year, though, Alabama fell short, and Waddle paid the price . Waddle is the latest high-profile athlete to publicly wear a rival school’s gear during a media session. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy — an Iowa State alum — had to wear Iowa gear after the CyHawk game . Then, Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown wore a Leprechaun outfit after his USC Trojans fell to Notre Dame this season. It’s all part of the good fun in the NFL. For Waddle, though, the media session was important as his status for Sunday’s game against the Buffalo Bills becomes clearer. He has been dealing with an ankle injury and is questionable for the matchup. However, he told reporters “there’s always a chance” he plays. NFL Network: Jaylen Waddle expected back for playoffs after high ankle sprain Waddle has been an important part of the Dolphins’ passing game this year, ranking second on the team with 1,014 yards and four touchdowns. Miami holds the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoff picture as part of an impressive regular season. Waddle is officially questionable for Sunday’s game against the Bills, according to the Dolphins’ injury report. He suffered a high ankle sprain against the Baltimore Ravens last week, putting his status in question. Immediately afterward, though, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport indicated the former Alabama star could find a way to play against the Bills. “He’s dealing with a high-ankle sprain, didn’t practice this week,” Rapoport reported on Sunday . “Not considered to be a severe one but could keep him out next week as well. My understanding is that Waddle, who is a quick healer, is expected back for the playoffs. “Remember a couple of years ago, he played in the National Championship when people were saying he shouldn’t, he heals quick, he wants to be on the field, that’s what I would expect in the playoffs.”",

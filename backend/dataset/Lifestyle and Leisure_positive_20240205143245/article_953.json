    "text": "Nationwide — Meet Deanna Dixon, a former backup singer for Beyoncé on her concert tours who is now known as “The Rideshare Queen” on TikTok for serenading her Uber passengers in Atlanta. One day, Dixon had a chance encounter with passenger Tedrien Hill, who generously gave her a $150 tip and encouraged her to buy a dashcam to record her videos to post on social media. “Don’t look down on what you may deem as small beginnings. Because all it takes is one person to see it and to change your life, and for me, that one person that saw me that changed my life was Tedrien,” Dixon told [11Alive](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/community/rideshare-queen-beyonce-deanna-dixon-tiktok/85-ed25da06-5dcb-42f6-a1f4-dbdcd5f33dc7). Now with her dashcam, Dixon has captured candid moments of her serenading her passengers with her soulful voice. Her videos quickly gained popularity on social media, amassing over 80,000 followers and millions of views. Dixon’s newfound fame led to sponsorships and a national deal, allowing her to buy her own car after a year of renting through Uber. In a heartwarming twist, a video captured Dixon reuniting with Hill, whom she affectionately calls her “Earth Angel,” to share the news of her new car purchase. “In my mind, it was a small thing because I was just making a connection, and it wasn’t,” Hill said. “So it makes me think like, there’s no small moments.” Now driving a stylish cobalt blue Tesla with over 100,000 online fans, the Rideshare Queen said she feels more seen. “I feel so free just being my honest, authentic self,” Dixon said. “This is probably my favorite chapter of my life, honestly. I drive for Uber.” Also, be sure to follow her on Instagram [@IAmDeannaDixon](https://www.instagram.com/iamdeannadixon/)",

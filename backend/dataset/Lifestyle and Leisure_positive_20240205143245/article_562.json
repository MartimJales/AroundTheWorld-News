    "text": "Looking for some post-holiday winter fun? Spend some time in the great outdoors at one of several candlelight events happening across Wisconsin! These events kick off on Jan. 6, 2024 and are scheduled at different locations through March 2024.\nThese free-to-low cost events typically begin around sunset and offer a variety of ways to enjoy the winter scenery after dark, including hiking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Many will include activities such as bonfires, hot chocolate, cider and other refreshments available for sale or by donation, and some will have open warming shelters.\nAlthough the amount of gear needed varies, warm clothing with layers is recommended for all events. Trekking poles are optional. A headlamp or flashlight is recommended. Some properties may have other equipment, such as snowshoes or an outdoor track chair, available to check out. Contact the property to see what is available and to make reservations.\nMost properties will require a 2024\nWisconsin state park admission fee and/or a state trail pass unless otherwise noted. A state park daily admission pass may be available to check out at participating libraries.\n2024 Candlelight Events\nAdditional events may be added.\nJan. 6\n- Mirror Lake State Park Candlelight Ski, Hike and Snowshoe\nJan. 13\n- Wildcat Mountain State Park Candlelight Hike/Snowshoe/Ski\n- Rib Mountain State Park Candlelight Snowshoe Hike\nJan. 14\n- Havenwoods State Forest Candlelight Hike\nJan. 20\n- Point Beach State Forest Candlelight Ski and Hike\n- Kettle Moraine State Forest – Southern Unit Candlelight Hike and Ski\nJan. 26\n- Red Cedar State Trail Candlelight Ski, Hike and Snowshoe\nJan. 27\n- Whitefish Dunes State Park Candlelight Ski and Hike\nJan. 28\n- Lake Wissota Candlelight Ski, Hike and Snowshoe\nFeb. 2\n- MacKenzie Center Candlelight Snowshoe Hike\nFeb. 3\n- Peninsula State Park Candlelight Hike/Snowshoe/Ski\n- Kettle Moraine State Forest – Northern Unit Candlelight Ski/Hike\n- Black Rover State Forest Candlelight Ski and Hike\n- Mirror Lake State Park Candlelight Ski, Hike and Snowshoe\nFeb. 10\n- Kettle Moraine State Forest – Pike Lake Unit Candlelight Hike\n- Interstate Park Candlelight Night\n- Governor Thompson State Park Candlelight Hike and Ski\nFeb. 17\n- Rib Mountain State Park Candlelight Snowshoe Hike\nFeb. 24\n- Hartman Creek State Park Candlelight Hike and Snowshoe\n- Hank Aaron State Trail Urban Candlelight Hike\n- Wyalusing State Park Candlelight Hike\nMarch 9\n- Big Foot Beach State Park Candlelight Hike\nThanks to the\nFriends groups of the parks, who organize many of the events and provide many of the volunteers to make these events possible.\nFind the full and additional details on the\nDNR’s Event Calendar.\nSome events are weather dependent; visitors are encouraged to check the DNR Events Calendar or call properties directly to confirm if an event will be held.\n|\n|\n|\n|\nATV/UTV Riders: Beware Of Winter Conditions\nMany of the state’s trails have yet to be covered in snow, but just because a winter road or trail is legally open for riding doesn’t mean it’s safe.

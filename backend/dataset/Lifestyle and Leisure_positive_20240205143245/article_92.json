    "text": "It's hard to look fashionable in a Christmas sweater with meat pie crumbs and mulled wine stains on it, and the intention of this text is certainly not to annoy anyone during the holidays. But as soon as spring arrives, many of us will surely spend too much money on the latest clothes, trying in vain to look like models on Instagram. We present the eight biggest fashion trends for 2024. [Dolce vita: The story of skateboards - how they came about, who made them famous and when](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-59069041?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) [Where and to whom to take excess clothes in Serbia](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/srbija-56584625?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) [No more \"I wear it a couple of times, then throw it away\": the EU is hitting fast fashion](https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/svet-60935724?xtor=AL-73-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bvijesti%5D-%5Blink%5D-%5Bserbian%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D) 1. Tuff pattern We counted every tuft at every fashion show held in 2023, and we can tell you that we counted a total of 12.487.396 dots. In other words, the catwalks were completely tuff. This pattern is often popular in the summer, but it's actually timeless and versatile, and you're likely to see it a lot throughout 2024. \"When you want to be elegant or make an impression, polka dots are the way to go,\" it says [Telegraf](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/how-to-wear-classic-polka-dot/). \"Tufna are playful, they don't know seriousness. Even the very name polka (a lively Central European dance) indicates the joy of living. \"They are big and bold, imperceptibly tiny, they are striking, they are silent... It is a design for everyone: for all genders, social classes, ages, timeless. \"It's time to 'connect the dots'\". 2. Cherry color Except for the pesky stone that has to be spit out, we love everything about cherries, and it was they who gave the catwalks in 2023 an eye-catching, bright and confident color. Some fashion houses presented cherry-colored creations from head to toe, while others limited it to skirts or jackets and combined it with other colors. \"Fashion's obsession with bright red has been impossible to ignore in recent seasons, as it has been seen on the catwalks as well as on the red carpet,\" says Alex Kessler of [of Vogue magazine](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/colour-trends-ss24). \"The spring/summer 2024 collections see a shift towards deeper and more luxurious shades of red\".

Metallic color Several designers have found inspiration in the pipes under the sink in their kitchens for the next fashion trend - various outfits and dresses with a metallic sheen. One of our favorite Met Gala fashion themes of the last decade was Man vs. Machine in 2016, when the most famous guests appeared in silver, futuristic creations with robot-inspired fashion details. Metallic colors once again dominated the scene in 2023 thanks to fans at Beyonc√©'s concerts during the tour promoting her Renaissance album. It looks like the trend will continue in 2024, and it has already dominated Paris Fashion Week, according to fashion house Net-A-Porter. \"Glittering pieces of metallic colors shone on the catwalks during the presentation of the Spring/Summer 2024 collections\". But, if you decide to go for gold, be careful not to overdo it. \"Metallic gold can give you a gladiator look,\" warns fashion guide StyleCaster. \"If you want to soften the effect, pair metallic gold with other materials, such as denim or leather.\" 4. Knitted pieces Let's move on to the main thing - knitted clothes. The weather in the UK is so terrible that quite frankly a nice cardigan or jumper never goes out of style. Digital fashion magazine Who What Wear notes that the Spring/Summer 2024 collections recognized that \"knitwear is worn all year round, but it shouldn't be any less fabulous than the rest of your wardrobe\". \"Erdem's embroidered cardigans were some of the most beautiful pieces we've seen,\" adds the fashion magazine. Fashion experts from W magazine also gave their opinion: \"Cardigans and sweaters knitted with the Fair Isle technique were the most popular knitted pieces this season.\" Fair Isle is an island in the Shetland Archipelago in Scotland, after which the famous Shetland sweaters are named. 5. Fluffy pattern We admit that these beautiful and detailed pieces are a little more sophisticated than the snowflakes we used to make out of paper and cut with scissors at school. \"Designers have become savvy this season,\" observes Drapers magazine, \"and the catwalks in Paris were abuzz with lace models and broderie anglaise (English/eyelet embroidery) during the presentation of the spring/summer 2024 collections.\" (Don't worry, we've already googled it - broderie anglaise is a technique in which holes of different shapes are made in the canvas, then edged with thread to give the appearance of a snowflake). Several of the outfits that were presented during the fashion weeks had a fluffy pattern on the front and in the center, while on other models, the snowflakes adorned transparent materials. 6. Bows and ribbons If you happen to be surrounded by torn wrapping paper while reading this, please do not throw bows and ribbons in the trash. Huge bows have appeared in the collections of several famous designers at various fashion weeks, so we will see them adorning various dresses in 2024. \"Large and sumptuous bows, which were seen at the shows of the Vietnamese brand Sixdo and the New York brand Aknvas, breathed eccentricity into models that would otherwise be simple and monotonous,\" writes the fashion magazine. [InStyle](https://www.instyle.com/spring-2024-fashion-trends-7965875). However, not all fashion houses opted for large and eye-catching bows. Some chose much smaller bows and ribbons as decorations or for tying pieces of clothing. \"The lovely accessory creates a soft, romantic look no matter how it's worn, and is a detail that stands out in a multitude of different silhouettes,\" writes the magazine. [Nylon](https://www.nylon.com/fashion/spring-2024-fashion-trends-runway). 7. Mini shorts If you've already been bombarded with tabloid headlines using the phrase \"show your long legs,\" you might want to skip this part. Next summer, mini shorts will be at the peak of popularity. We will see them in different colors and styles, and made of different materials. \"All the leg exercises in the gym will pay off,\" say fashion house Net-A-Porter, \"because if recent events on the catwalks have told us anything, it's that come summer 2024, mini shorts will really be a staple piece.\" to show self-confidence\". 8. Recycled, worn or sustainable materials Probably the most important fashion trend that we could all follow in 2024 is green. But it's not about the color. The fashion industry has long raised concerns about sustainability, as it is a major polluter. A huge number of consumers buy a cheap item, wear it a few times and then throw it away. Little progress is being made towards solving the fashion industry's carbon footprint, such as the growing popularity of websites promoting worn-out, \"once-loved wardrobe items\". However, many believe that much more needs to be done. That's why we applaud designers who put sustainability in the center of attention, both those who change business practices and those who use worn-out materials to create new models. Among the examples he cited [British Vogue](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/sustainability-ss24) is Stella McCartney using Kelsun, a fabric made from seaweed, which is believed to have a significantly lower carbon footprint than standard fibres. Meanwhile, American fashion house Eckhaus Latta presented a series of pants made from 3D-printed yarn, thereby avoiding the process of making fabric and reducing excess inventory, while speeding up the production process. \"Waste materials and unusable supplies get a second life through new pieces of clothing,\" believes fashion platform Fashion United. \"Materials intended for waste are salvaged and processed. \"Thus assembled, patched and layered pieces, imperfect, worn and in some places torn, are not hidden, but promoted\". As consumer awareness of their carbon footprint grows, perhaps the pieces many choose to wear the most in 2024 will be the ones already hanging in their wardrobes.

    "text": "Gerard Butler is set to reprise his role as Stoick the Vast in the upcoming live-action\nHow To Train Your Dragon remake. Deadline has reported that Butler will indeed play the live-action version of Stoick the Vast — the father of franchise protagonist Hiccup. The actor voiced said character in all three of the animated films, meaning he will have played the role in both animated and live-action mediums. Butler is joining Mason Thames and Nico Parker in the remake, who will be playing Hiccup and Astrid, respectively.\nHow to Train Your Dragon is produced by Marc Platt Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. Dean DeBlois, the writer and director for all three movies in the animated trilogy, will also be the writer and director of the remake.\nThe How to Train Your Dragon franchise is based on Cressida Cowell’s children’s book series of the same name. Cowell’s original story centered around Hiccup, a young aspiring inventor who wants to make his Viking father proud by becoming a dragon slayer. Things don’t go as planned when Hiccup finds himself unexpectedly forming a bond with a Night Fury dragon.\nHow many How To Train Your Dragon movies are there?\nFollowing the success of the 2010 film, it was followed by two more sequels which all received critical acclaim in multiple Oscar nominations including Best Animated Feature. The animated films featured the voices of\nJay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Cate Blanchett, Kit Harington, and more. The franchise is a box office success, with a combined worldwide gross of over $1.6 billion.",

    "text": "My mother has severe dementia. We have the same routine every night. I will take her to the bathroom, get her ready for bed and she takes her meds. Every night when I go in her room to tell her that I need to help her up so I can help her to the bathroom, she gives me a mean look and just stares at me. She doesn't like to stand and walk because it hurts her back and knees. Once I get her up she's pretty good at walking, just slow. However, getting her to cooperate is horrible. She fights and struggles against the chair, refusing to help me. She pushes back with her feet and hits and kicks. She's very strong. I have to get her into the bathroom so she doesn't have an accident. What can I do? I get extremely anxiety filled every evening when I know that the battle is soon to begin. I try to be as nice and comforting as possible. She's fairly cooperative in the mornings and pleasant during the day. It's the evenings that are so horrible. Is there a way to overcome this? Is there something I could do different? She only uses the bathroom twice a day now because I can't get her to go. She says she doesn't have to when I ask. I know that she has to go in the evening. We barely get her on the toilet and she's going. I will take and suggestions. I am at my wits end and a stressed out wreck over this.",

(I haven't really tried to make this an exhaustive list, and I know the sample I started with has big blind spots.) [I’d really appreciate feedback on the EA Newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB2Z3ac3MJZ2pxNMGMntyxmFRCruWTzduL7bHaP2fdx5hndw/viewform?usp=sf_link)if you’re subscribed to it ( [see archives and subscribe here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-newsletter-archives)). We get very little constructive feedback ion it, and feedback could help us improve a newsletter that goes out to 60K subscribers. - More context on how and why I made this: I wanted to collect “important stuff from 2023” to reflect on the year, and realized that one of the resources I have is one I run — the monthly [EA Newsletter](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-newsletter-archives). So I started compiling what was meant to be a quick doc-turned-post (by pulling out good links from the 2023 emails, occasionally updating them and remembering related content that I also thought was good). Things kind of ballooned as I worked on this post and added non-Newsletter links. Long story short, there are now two posts; see [the companion post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/z4Z4BA2tMGbN3fSiL/2023-news-on-ai-safety-animal-welfare-global-health-and-more), which is less focused on content/research and more focused on \"news.\" - For more cool EA-related content from 2023, see: [curated Forum posts](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/recommendations), [talks from EA conferences](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PzudRLNHqSGDw8rZk/2023-ea-conference-talks-are-now-live)in 2023, and [your EA Forum Wrapped](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/wrapped)recommendations (we’ll also try to compile a post from [what people mark as “most valuable”](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TdMSpzSqkQDccnSy2/posts-from-2022-you-thought-were-valuable-or-underrated)). Highlights: content by causes Links that stand out, loosely organized into cause areas (although a lot of the content is useful for more than one cause area/category).

Unfortunately, people often don’t do this (we tend to flinch away from uncomfortable ideas), and even when we do, we rarely discuss it publicly. [...] Anima International had been running a campaign against live fish sales in Poland. [...] Both the farming and transportation of the fish cause a lot of suffering — so progress seemed exciting. Unfortunately, it turned out that the campaign was causing unexpected harm; some people were switching from carp to salmon, and farming salmon requires farming more fish to feed the salmon (which are carnivorous). Anima International’s models and research showed that the campaign was worse than they’d hoped, and even tentatively implied that the program was harmful overall. They decided to stop the campaign.

In the US, Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) [testified before the Senate today]and pushed for safety-oriented regulation, and earlier the [White House met with Altman and other AI CEOs]to talk about potential dangers. And in the EU, [a proposed AI Act]would classify and regulate AI systems based on their risk levels. Understanding what regulations are most effective is probably harder. Luke Muehlhauser, a senior program officer at Open Philanthropy, recently suggested [12 tentative ideas for US AI policy]. These include tracking and licensing big clusters of cutting-edge chips, requiring that frontier AI models follow stringent information security protections, and subjecting powerful models to testing and evaluation by independent auditors. It’s helpful to understand what strategies can look like, but more research and work are required before the ideas can be implemented.

A new [report]suggests that AMR is responsible for millions of deaths each year (particularly in sub-Saharan Africa) and has serious economic costs — by one [estimate], $55 billion every year in the US alone. The problem is neglected and getting worse as the overuse of antibiotics in healthcare and [food production]continues and more drug-resistance bacteria evolve. There are promising approaches for working on AMR. These include creating incentives to accelerate the development of new antimicrobial medicines, contributing to quantitative research on the causes of AMR, running fellowships for policymakers, improving diagnostics (and their accessibility) to prevent misuse of antimicrobials, and raising the profile of AMR.

Training powerful AI models requires a lot of advanced chips and computing resources — “compute.” While regulating algorithmic research and other resources could be especially difficult, advanced chips could be tracked, licensed, and controlled. (Compute governance is discussed at length in a recent [80,000 Hours Podcast episode].) In [an Asterisk article], Carl Robichaud argues that nuclear non-proliferation has lessons for AI governance — like the importance of understanding choke points.

Some insights: - The vast majority (~99%) of reduced suffering came from restricting cage use for chickens. Ballot initiatives that targeted egg-laying hens were over a hundred times more cost-effective than those that target only veal calves and sows. - Ballot initiatives averted about a year of extreme suffering for an animal per $10, and were about 21% to 81% as cost-effective [corporate cage-free campaigns](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/farm-animal-welfare/cage-free-reforms/), which are [unusually successful](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/why-are-the-us-corporate-cage-free-campaigns-succeeding/). - There are a lot of uncertainties, but many reasons to be optimistic about future ballot initiatives.

This isn’t fantasy; “germicidal” ultraviolet radiation can neutralize airborne pathogens — either in special zones [removed from humans]or throughout rooms via skin-safe “ [far-UVC]” light. Far-UVC is particularly exciting because of two major advantages; the lights would cut transmission of many different diseases (including novel diseases) and installing far-UVC in essential spaces would reduce pandemic risk without relying on individuals to take specific actions. But we’re not yet ready to use far-UVC to prevent pandemics. In a [recent overview], Max Görlitz argues that more work is needed before we can widely deploy the technology. For instance, it seems that far-UVC doesn’t penetrate human skin, but its effects on eyesight should be studied more carefully. And it might not be enough to make sure that far-UVC is safe and effective; getting the most out of far-UVC might mean supporting deployment, as purely commercially driven adoption might lead to less useful installations that underinvest in protection against less frequent but more extreme situations. […] Improving agricultural yields: [Hannah Ritchie on why it makes sense to be optimistic about the environment](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/hannah-ritchie-environmental-optimism/) (80,000 Hours) [The average farmer in Tanzania has to work for a year to get as much output as the average U.S. farmer does in three to four days; some] regions have much higher crop yields (per unit of land) than others. A [key] reason for this disparity is the fact that [agricultural productivity has grown much slower in sub-Saharan Africa]than in other regions, and the reduced productivity causes serious issues. In [a recent podcast episode on a range of environmental topics], Hannah Ritchie argues that improving agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa would significantly help global living standards. Many farmers (who account for the majority of the region’s poorest people) don’t have extra time or resources to invest in productivity improvements like better irrigation systems. They also lack access to richer markets (in part due to the EU’s agricultural policies). As a result, many are trapped in poverty. But the problem might be tractable; we know it's possible to increase agricultural productivity on a large scale as we've [done it before]. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, influencing policy and supporting things like irrigation systems and high-yield crops could help launch an agritech market that helps with these problems. These interventions would also significantly mitigate the environmental impacts of farming by reducing the need for more farmland. About [half of the world’s habitable land is used for agriculture], leading to problems like biodiversity loss. Projections imply that without agricultural productivity improvements, we’d need [26% more cropland by 2050]— an area the size of India and Germany combined.

The plan was to collect potentially dangerous virus samples in the wild, analyze the samples in labs to identify the viruses capable of causing a pandemic, and publish a ranked list of dangerous viruses and their genomes. Some, like MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt, expressed [concerns]that sharing a list like that could significantly lower the barrier for terrorists or others who might want to start a pandemic by providing them with instructions on which viruses to use; “gene synthesis,” which can print a virus’s DNA given its genome, would help them do the rest. The program wound down this summer. (To lower the chances of human-made pandemics, governments could require that gene synthesis companies [screen orders and customers].) Related [concerns have been raised about openly sharing powerful AI models]. “Open-sourcing” is often presented in a positive light, but giving total access to an AI model is a [risky]and irreversible choice; there’s no way to take an open-sourced model down or set up protections if we later discover that the model is too dangerous. AI models are becoming more powerful and some [worrying possibilities]have already been demonstrated, like when a group of researchers [discovered]that a model they were using to screen new drugs for toxicity could be repurposed to suggest 40,000 new possible chemical weapons in six hours. Instead of being shared without safeguards, powerful AI models could be [evaluated for extreme risks]and then released via a [structured access model]that lets researchers study copies without sharing the models irreversibly. [Why we didn't get a malaria vaccine sooner](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-didnt-get-a-malaria-vaccine-sooner) (Works in Progress) It’s worth celebrating the progress of two promising [malaria vaccines]and the rollout of the [RTS,S vaccine], which was endorsed by the WHO in 2021. But, given that malaria kills around [half a million children]every year (or more than 1000 children every day) and the fact that the RTS,S vaccine alone spent 23 years in trials and pilot studies before it was licensed, it’s also worth asking why it took so long to get a malaria vaccine — and what we can do to speed things up next time. A recent [article on why we didn’t get a malaria vaccine sooner]explains that while malaria poses some unique problems, one obstacle was broader: lack of funding. Malaria affects some of the poorest countries (which can't afford expensive vaccines), and developing a vaccine costs a lot of money and time (especially given the [high]chance of failure). The expected payoff wasn't large enough to incentivize individual firms to invest the resources needed. The authors make the case for “ [advance market commitments]” (AMCs), where governments or philanthropists promise to subsidize a new vaccine in large quantities if it’s developed and countries actually want to use it.

Accidents or carelessness could still lead to catastrophic delays and other issues, so Esvelt argues that we should only start small and local (via “ [daisy drives]”) and only proceed with proper regulation and community buy-in. The podcast episode also covers why and how we should protect society from those who might want to start a civilization-ending pandemic. The number of people who have the ability to identify and release a dangerous virus is growing [...]. But some things could help. For instance: - Monitoring [wastewater]for suspicious patterns or signs of edited DNA to detect pandemics early - Investing in developing better [personal protective equipment](and stockpiling it) - Installing virus-neutralizing [far-UVC]lights in workplaces and labs [...] What does democratic oversight of AI look like? (GovAI: [What Do We Mean When We Talk About “AI Democratisation”?](https://www.governance.ai/post/what-do-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-ai-democratisation)) Recent polls suggest that most U.S. voters would approve of regulation that [prevents]or [slows down]AI superintelligence, favor [restricting the release]of AI models we don’t fully understand, and [prefer federal regulation]of AI development over self-regulation by tech companies. It’s hard to accurately interpret poll results like these, but they point to unease and a disconnect between the general public and some major AI labs in the U.S. So it’s worth exploring how the public should be involved in steering AI development. People sometimes talk about “AI democratization,” but the phrase is vague. An overview from the Centre for the Governance of AI outlines [different things people mean by “AI democratization”]and how the stances diverge. The post (and [accompanying paper]) explains that democratizing AI use (making AI more accessible), development (helping a wider range of people contribute to AI design), benefits (more equitably distributing the benefits of AI), and governance (distributing influence over how AI should be used, developed, and shared to a wider community of stakeholders) have significant differences. Democratizing AI governance doesn’t necessarily mean making it possible for everyone to use or build AI models however they want, but rather introducing [democratic processes]like [citizen assemblies]to give people input on key decisions about AI.

One of the things you'd need to evaluate to answer this question is how long a new policy would persist before it would probably [be] repealed. […] A [recent paper]that analyzes historical data from the US finds that policy changes are surprisingly persistent. A narrowly passed referendum will probably (80%) still be in place a century later. Moreover, referendums that narrowly fail will probably (60%) not pass at all in the next century. This suggests that advocacy for policy change might be much more cost-effective than is often assumed. […] [Air pollution is responsible for ~12% of deaths: what might help?](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/santosh-harish-air-pollution/) Air pollution accounts for the deaths of close to [6.7 million]people per year (including half a million infants). Pollution is particularly bad in countries like India, where the average person might be losing 3 to 6 years of life expectancy due to bad air. And the problem is incredibly [neglected]. In a [recent podcast], Santosh Harish discusses the main causes of air pollution and some potentially cost-effective interventions. Indoor pollution can result from people [burning solid fuels for cooking]. (Unfortunately, a lack of access to cleaner fuels like liquid petroleum gas or reliable electricity means many people have no choice except to use fuels like firewood.) Outdoor air pollution is caused by waste burning, illegal industrial gas dumping, vehicle emissions, and more. And policies meant to prevent air pollution are often outdated or left unenforced. Research, policy outreach, and technical assistance to governments could be effective ways for philanthropy to support work on this problem. Anything that improves energy efficiency would also help, as have subsidies that help people switch from solid fuels.

This was an unusual newsletter. Many people donate right at the end of the year, so the December EA Newsletter’ focused on featuring exciting charities (in case people want to donate to them) and giving readers a sense of what people who are working on EA-related projects (or projects that look pretty good from an EA perspective) actually do. Featured content Doing good via new charities ( [LEEP](https://leadelimination.org/) and [Charity Entrepreneurship](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/) as a case study) Exposure to tiny amounts of lead can lower a child’s IQ by 1-6 points, shorten their lifespan, and more. People know that lead is harmful, but few are aware of just how widespread the problem is; [1 out of every 3]children worldwide has unsafe blood lead levels. And the global toll is [catastrophic]. Can charities help? In [a recent podcast episode], Lucia Coulter discusses the [Lead Exposure Elimination Project](LEEP), which she co-founded in 2020. LEEP identifies and alerts communities that are unwittingly being exposed to lead paint, and provides support to local governments and producers as they transition to lead-free paint. [...] LEEP seems extremely [cost-effective][...]. Coulter didn't stumble into lead exposure — she applied to a 2020 charity incubation program run by [Charity Entrepreneurship](CE), for which CE researchers had pre-selected [eight promising charity ideas]. As a participant, Lucia Coulter picked one of the eight ideas, paired up with a cofounder, refined the plan, and got LEEP off the ground with training and $60K in seed funding from CE. Charity Entrepreneurship incubates 5-8 charities every year, and the charities they launch have a strong [track record]. If you want to support new charities that are likely to achieve a lot of good, consider donating to [CE’s Incubated Charities Fund](see [their 2024 charity ideas]) or to [individual charities]they’ve launched. Farmed animal welfare is neglected, but some charities are making important progress ( [The Humane League](https://thehumaneleague.org/) and the [Animal Welfare Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare) as examples) In 2023, farmed animal welfare advocates got 130 companies to agree to stop using [battery cages]in the coming years. Corporate pledges like these are a [tested approach]that is expected to help a huge number of animals; if companies implement the changes they promised, the ~ [3000 pledges]secured to date would reduce the suffering of around 800 million chickens alive at any time. (Around 90% of the pledges that have come due by last year have been fully implemented.) This progress and [some other wins]were achieved by a handful of animal advocacy organizations that could accomplish more if they were less funding-constrained. (The total annual budget of all organizations that try to promote farmed animal welfare is [estimated]to be a bit over $200 million. For context, [over $1 billion annually]is spent on animal shelters in the US, supporting significantly fewer animals. As a different reference, the Metropolitan Museum of Art had a budget of [over $300 million]last year.) […] Some donation options are less direct but might achieve more (highlighting [charitable funds](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/blog/new-recommendations-and-cause-area-funds), and [effective giving initiatives](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ME4ihqRojjuhprejm/effective-giving-incubation-apply-to-ce-and-gwwc-s-new) like [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/charities/giving-what-we-can)) Researchers have argued that giving to [expert-led charitable funds]is often more effective than supporting individual charities. Fund managers’ expertise and resources mean that donations tend to be used more effectively, and recipient organizations might benefit from the consistency and additional support that funds can provide. Three new cause-area funds were recently [announced]by Giving What We Can: the [Global Health and Wellbeing Fund], the [Effective Animal Advocacy Fund], and the [Risks and Resilience Fund]. They’ve also [highlighted]some older funds that have a strong track record. Supporting “effective giving initiatives,” which focus on raising money for high-impact opportunities, [might]be another way to get more out of your donations. [Giving What We Can](GWWC), for instance, seems to generate around [$30]for highly effective charities per $1 spent on its operations, has encouraged [thousands to pledge to give 10%]of their lifetime income, and supports a variety of other projects. Some other effective giving initiatives operate primarily outside of English-speaking countries, like [Effektiv Spenden], [Ayuda Efectiva], and [Doneer Effectief]. [...] Other exciting organizations […] For more comprehensive lists, explore projects featured [on GWWC's site], charity recommendations from [staff at Open Philanthropy]and the charity evaluator [GiveWell], or [read posts about donation choice on the EA Forum].

    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY – A local real estate expert anticipates a strong spring season in the residential market due to lower interest rates. A Realtor.com 2024 forecast predicts mortgage rates will turn the corner in 2024. The prediction is based on the assumption that inflation will continue to cool. National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects Midwest markets like Oklahoma City to experience gains from being in the most affordable region of the U.S. “The demand for housing will recover from falling mortgage rates and rising income,” Yun said in a December statement. “In addition, housing inventory is expected to rise by around 30% as more sellers begin to list after delaying selling over the past two years.” OKCMAR Board President Emilykaye Mitchelson expressed confidence Friday that 2024 will outperform 2023. As one of the nation’s most affordable markets, the Oklahoma City metro is seeing steady price appreciation, unlike more expensive markets like San Francisco, where Redfin reports homeowners are selling at a loss. According to MLS data, the average selling price of a home in the Oklahoma City metro area was $286,146 in November 2023, up $2,855 year-over-year. Mitchelson said 2024 will continue the trend of a stabilizing market, as evidenced by less instances of multiple offers on homes. She said winter is usually the slowest season for the housing market, but industry experts expect a busier spring than last year. “We are still seeing multiple offers on some homes that are priced below $300,000, but some of the higher (priced homes) are sitting a little bit longer,” Mitchelson said. Mitchelson said moderating interest rates in 2024 will bring buyers back into the market and incentivize some fence sitters to put their homes on the market. That’s a trend that may have already started. In November 2023, the Oklahoma City market had 5943 listings, up 656 year-over-year. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.6% last week, according to Freddie Mac. From late October to mid-December, the rate fell by more than a percentage point. Buyer expectations have gradually shifted as the days of sub-4% mortgages become further in the past, Mitchelson said. “While they may be able to buy a little bit less house than if the interest rates were, you know, 3.5% or 4%, they are adjusting and then buying what they can afford, because still, homeownership is one of the greatest wealth-building strategies that we have,” Mitchelson said. Another trend carrying into the new year, Mitchelson said, is the philosophy of marrying the house and dating the mortgage. She said builders and lenders are teaming up to offer different types of mortgage products. “A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is not the only animal in town,” Mitchelson said. “If you can find something that fits your needs, and you can afford to buy it, then you can refinance later.” For those looking to purchase a home in 2024, Mitchelson said it might be a good idea to look in rural areas such as Deer Creek where incentives exist for homebuyers that can get them into the market for an attractive rate. She also suggests working with a realtor, because they will be able to help in negotiating the best deal to fit the buyer’s needs as tight supply continues into 2024.",

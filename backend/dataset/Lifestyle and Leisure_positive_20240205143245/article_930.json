    "text": "Good\nnews for fans of the Quebec star! One of Celine Dion’s villas, located in Quebec, Canada, is now available for rent on Airbnb since the end of December. At the time, the singer had it built, in 2002, for her mother, Thérèse Tanguay. With a “amazing water view”the villa composed of eight bedrooms and of four bathrooms is able to accommodate up to 17 people. And for people traveling with their pets, the platform reports that it is possible to accommodate them as well.\nEquipped with a large double garage, fully equipped for washing cars, the residence 560 square meters, fully furnished, also includes three independent fireplaces. The house has been available to interested Canadians and tourists since December 23. “We were booked almost each day from the beginning”underlines François Duplantie, a real estate developer from Laval, for\nthe Journal de Montréal.\nREAD ALSO Johnny Hallyday and Nathalie Baye: their old house has been abandoned since the sale\n800 euros per night\nThe residence was purchased in 2023 by François Duplantie, three years after the death of “Maman Dion”, at the price of $2.1 million. “The minimum price is $1,100 per night (800 euros) for 17 people, but we have a discount right now for the first three Airbnb rentals”specifies the real estate developer.\nThe villa is located next to one of the largest parks in the Quebec region. And with a little luck, snow lovers will even be able to snowshoe, cross-country ski, and slide. According to the announcement, it is even possible to skate or fish on the ice right in front of the house. The owners also promise a “thermal experience” from spring 2024 with spa, sauna, cold bath, outdoor fire, meditation dock, yoga, etc.\nRead more: Already 16 episodes of FC De Kampioenen are no longer broadcast due to inappropriate humor | show\nReceive our latest\nnews Every week, your appointment with real estate news.\n2024-01-05 22:00:15\n#house #belonged #Céline #Dion #rented #Airbnb",

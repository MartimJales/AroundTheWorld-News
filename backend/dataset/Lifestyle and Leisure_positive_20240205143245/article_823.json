    "text": "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (KAKE) - A 92-year-old man has proved age is just a number by breaking the Guinness World Record for the oldest person to cross the Grand Canyon.\nThe Guinness World Records said the man, Alfredo Aliaga Burdio, came all the way from Berlin, Germany to complete his trek on October 15, 2023, becoming the oldest person to cross the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim on foot (male).\n“I have hiked in the Grand Canyon many times in my life,” he said. \"I came here with my wife, Ingrid, quite a few times and we did cross it from rim to rim several times.\"\nBurdio&apos;s wife died in 2006 from ALS, the GWR says, and he wanted to revisit the place they traveled. Together with his daughter and nine-year-old grandson, Burdio set out once again to hike the canyon rim to rim.\nAgain in October of 2022, he crossed the Grand Canyon yet again with his son in just four days. The GWR says it was during this trip that he came up with the idea to attempt to break the record.\n“I had read about the previous record holder, Mr. John Jepkema whom I admired immensely,” said Burdio. “I knew that I was only a few months younger than Mr. Jepkema had been and thought that I had a great shot at setting a new record the following year.”\nIn January of 2023, Burdio says he began training for what would be the hike of a lifetime by walking 8 miles every day.\nFinally, nine months later, Burdio accomplished his mission and broke the record. The GWR says he was also greeted by the Tucson Fire Department during his trek, who awarded him a patch, making him an honorary member of the fire department.\nThe entire trip took Burdio 34 hours and 2 minutes, but his actual hiking time was 21 hours and 15 minutes according to the GWR .\nBurdio says he is now looking forward to all 2024 has in store for him.",

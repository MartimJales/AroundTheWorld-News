So I found an oldie here local that I know has been hunted before. I still wanted to see if I could pull something they missed! Sure enough I got two tokens in the back yard, and when I got to the front I was like pretty sure that’s all I was gonna get that they’d missed. The fronts are usually always hammered! Up by the hedges close to the house on the right side of the sidewalk I got a nice 94-95 solid signal . Dug it out at about 7”, and it was a Cool old Unicorn. Just about to wrap up the front and leave and I got a nice deep target hitting in the Indian/Zinc range(84-87), but faint and solid. This one was about 8” deep. I had to go and couldn’t make it out when I pulled it out so I stuck it in My finds container and had to leave. When I got home I may have been a little excited to see if it was a Wheat or an Indian, cause I’ve gotten Wheats with these numbers before. Sure enough as soon as I got it out I could see the Wreath on the back side. Yes!!😁 After using a toothpick I got the date of 1893!!! I like it when that happens 😎 Thanks for looking and Happy Hunting !!!

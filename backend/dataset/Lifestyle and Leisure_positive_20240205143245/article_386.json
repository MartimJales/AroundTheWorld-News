    "text": "Jonathan Davis Held His Baby Boy in His Lap While Singing Korn’s Classic Song About F*cking Last year, [Korn](https://www.metalsucks.net/?s=korn) and sports clothing brand ADIDAS did the thing that should have been done nearly 30 years ago, as the two joined forces to [put out a super expensive clothing line](https://www.metalsucks.net/2023/10/19/korn-and-adidas-formally-announce-new-clothing-partnership/). It was insanely popular, people went nuts, and it [sold out like a motherfucker](https://www.metalsucks.net/2023/10/27/scalpers-had-a-field-day-as-that-korn-adidas-tracksuit-and-sneaker-collab-already-sold-out/). But ask most people what comes to mind when they think of the band and the brand is the song they wrote for their 1996 album Life Is Peachy, “A.D.I.D.A.S.” — or you know, “All Day I Dream About Sex.” During a recent [interview with ADIDAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ypjnetX1k), Korn frontman [Jonathan Davis](https://www.metalsucks.net/?s=jonathan+davis) admitted to an interesting, if not a little odd, bit of lore behind the song. It turns out his then newborn son Nathan was involved in the recording of that song and before you say something out of pocket in the comments, not in any gross, untoward way you degenerates. “It’s very immature and juvenile. It representative of where we were at at that point in time. You’re 24 years old. That’s all you really fuckin’ think about, especially being in a rock band. That’s just the whole dream and everything. But it’s like, at that time that song was everything to me. “What’s fucked up about it, when I performed it, if you listen, my firstborn son Nathan was between my legs when I sang that song. And in the breakdown you can hear him cooing in the background.” So there ya have it, folks. Jonathan Davis decided to share details about the birds and the bees with his son quick as hell. If you’d like to be able to hear the band possibly play that song live, you can catch them in Europe over the summer.

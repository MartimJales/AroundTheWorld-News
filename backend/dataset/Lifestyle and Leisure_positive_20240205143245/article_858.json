    "text": "Planning a trip to one of Tasmania’s most beautiful (and delicious) islands? Don’t miss all these incredible things to do on Bruny Island on your visit!\nIf you like food, wine, cheese and some of the best easy day hikes in Tasmania, then Bruny Island is the place for you!\nLocated just off the southeastern coast of Tasmania and a short drive from Hobart, Bruny Island is a remarkably diverse and beautiful destination where you can spend your days out in spectacular wilderness, learning about native wildlife or fill your stomachs with delicious food and wine (or beer).\nWell, that’s what we did, and there really is something to offer for every traveller.\nTo make a visit to Bruny Island even easier, you can take your car or motorhome over on the ferry for a reasonable cost, meaning you’ll have your own transport to get around.\nNo trip ticking off all the\ngreat places to visit in Tasmania would be complete without spending a day (or a weekend) exploring all the incredible activities and attractions here.\nTo help you plan your trip, here’s our comprehensive guide to the best things to do on Bruny Island.\nTable of Contents\nThe Best Things to Do on Bruny Island, Tasmania 1) Try Some Local Honey at The Honey Pot 2) Bruny Island Cheese Co. 3) Cape Queen Elizabeth Hike 4) Walk the Green Point Trail 5) Hike Up to the Fluted Cape Lookout 6) Take a Scenic Flight Over Bruny Island 7) Go to the Truganini Lookout for Sensational Views Over The Neck 8) Visit the Penguin Rookery 9) Learn About the Cape Bruny Lighthouse 10) Hike the Luggaboine Circuit 11) Hike the Whole Labillardiere Peninsula Circuit 12) Bruny Island Cruises 13) Get Into the Oysters at Get Shucked! 14) Have a Nip at the Bruny Island House of Whisky Bruny Island Travel Guide Where to Stay – Accommodation on Bruny Island Places to Visit on Bruny Island Tasmania How to Get to Bruny Island Tasmania\nThe Best Things to Do on Bruny Island, Tasmania\nWe really enjoyed our time here and were overwhelmed with all the things you can do on Bruny Island.\nWe took our campervan over for 3 nights, which was the best thing we could have done as it gave us the freedom to explore Bruny Island on our own time.\nIf you don’t have your own wheels there are lots of great day tours you can book.\nThis one is by far the best you can do as a day trip from Hobart.\nThe best way to get around is to rent a car and explore on your own! We recommend\nRental Cars, which has the largest range of vehicles for the best value on the market.\nIt was our goal to find out what to do on Bruny Island and tick off as many of the activities as possible.\nSo if you love eating local food, sampling boutique beer and wine, hiking coastal headlands, visiting quaint little shops and diving into history, you’re in for a treat with this article of the best things to do in Bruny Island.\n1) Try Some Local Honey at The Honey Pot\nOur first stop on our trip to Bruny Island was\nThe Honey Pot, where we tried all kinds of different, you guessed it, honey products!\nThe Honey Pot is a local beekeeping business that makes incredible, award-winning honey.\nMuch more than just a place to buy sweet nectar, the storefront is filled with all kinds of information about bees and honey making.\nAs adults, we found this fascinating, but if you’re looking for things to do on Bruny Island with kids, this is really interesting.\nYou’ll find all different types of honey here, including Leatherwood, Manuka, Prickly Box, Fennel, Clover, Bush and Blue Gum. We honestly had no idea there were so many different varieties before we arrived!\nAnd best of all, you can try them all! Well worth stopping by when you drive past.\n2) Bruny Island Cheese Co.\nNext we stopped off at the Bruny Island Cheese Company on North Bruny, where they make their own beer, wine and cheese. I know – everything you need in one place!\nNick Haddow, the owner of\nBruny Island Cheese Co, has a passion for cheese and being a specialist cheese maker, he was committed to the traditional methods of making cheese.\nThey have display windows so you can have a look into the kitchen and see how they make all their different products.\nWe got a taster plate and settled in with some drinks to give them a try. The flavours and textures were unreal. Even the wood-fired bread was amazing.\nIn 2016 they added craft beer to the mix, and boy are we glad they did!\nUsing locally grown ingredients for their beers with 100% Tasmanian-grown hops, they brew several delicious ales and stouts.\nBecause their recipes rely on whatever local ingredients they can get their hands on, you never know what they’ll have on tap.\nWe recommend getting the tasting paddle so you can try them all and choose your favourite. They also have a tasting paddle of some local Bruny Island premium wines.\nThe atmosphere at Bruny Island Cheese Co is also fantastic, with a spacious and lush outdoor area making everyone who comes in want to settle in for the day to eat and drink their worries away.\n3) Cape Queen Elizabeth Hike\n- Location: Near Bruny Island Airstrip. Across the road from The Honey Pot\n- Distance: 7km return out to The Arch or 12km return out to the Cape\n- Time: 2 – 4 hours return\nTo work off all the cheese, beer, wine and honey, make sure you go out on a hike to Cape Queen Elizabeth.\nThis hike is popular for people who want to see the iconic arch right on the beach. Everyone gets their photo there, and we did too of course.\nStart from the car park across the road from The Honey Pot place. You will follow a 4WD trail (not for the public), which will get thinner and eventually turn into a bush trail.\nOnce you get to a fork you can go down to the beach or up over the mountain, depending on the tide (check the tide chart at the trailhead).\nREAD MORE: Keen to do some more hiking around the state? Check out our list of all the\nepic things to do in Tasmania!\nAt low tide you can walk along the beach and around the rocks to get to the famous arch and beyond out to Cape Queen Elizabeth. Many people will just walk out of the arch and head back.\nIf it is high tide, you will not be able to make it around the rocks on the beach. Instead take the trail up the hill over the other side and access the arch and trail to Cape Queen Elizabeth from there.\nThe walk is truly stunning, no matter whether you go all the way to the Cape or just. to the arch. Make sure you take water and some snacks with you.\n4) Walk the Green Point Trail\n- Location: At the end of Adventure Bay Road\n- Distance: 4km return\n- Time: 1 – 1.5 hours\nThe Green Point Trail is one of the best things you can do on Bruny Island if you have young kids or do not want to do a strenuous hike. It is not pram or wheelchair friendly though.\nStart at the Grass Point Trail at the end of Adventure Bay Road from the Fluted Cape parking area.\nFrom here walk along the beach and then up onto a flat, well-maintained trail that follows the edge of the bay.\nYou may spot different wildlife along the way so keep your eye out. The trail will lead you all the way out to Green Point. There is an information board at the end to tell you more about the area.\nAfter your relaxing walk keep an eye out for Bruny Island’s famous white wallaby, as this is the bay where this little one lives.\n5) Hike Up to the Fluted Cape Lookout\n- Location: At the end of Adventure Bay Road\n- Distance: 5.6km return or 6.2km for the whole loop\n- Time: 2.5 – 3 hours\nStill feel like walking? Perfect! Because the Fluted Cape Track out of Adventure Bay is one of the best hikes on Bruny Island.\nLocated within South Bruny National Park, this delightful, adventurous circuit walk cuts past Green Point and up over Fluted Cape, following precarious sea cliffs and offering incredible views.\nYou can do the hike in either direction. If you hike anticlockwise you will head to Green Point first and follow the cliffs up to the Fluted Cape Lookout.\nClockwise, which is the direction we went, takes you up a steep path through the forest, getting you to the top quicker and allowing you to walk at a gentle downhill slope back down along the elevated coastline.\nThe highlights include standing on the edge of enormous cliffs, views out to Penguin Island and Adventure Bay, and if you’re lucky a lot of birdlife in\nthe national park.\nDefinitely a tourism highlight in our list of Bruny Island activities. South Bruny National Park is a real gem.\n6) Take a Scenic Flight Over Bruny Island\nWhy not see Bruny Island from a different perspective?\nExperience Bruny Island’s diverse geography and beautiful beaches from the air with a scenic flight over this south-eastern Tasmanian island.\nYou’ll enjoy stunning views of The Neck, the rugged coastline, mountains and more as the experienced local pilots take you up for an unforgettable ride.\nLocated right on the Bruny Island Main Road, Island Scenic Flights is the only carrier based at the Bruny Island Airport.\nThey have different flights available for you to choose from\nhere.\nREAD MORE: Have more time? Don’t miss our expert guide on how to spend\n2 weeks in Tasmania on a road trip!\n7) Go to the Truganini Lookout for Sensational Views Over The Neck\nTruganini Lookout is located on the narrow isthmus of land that separates Bruny Island from north and south, better known as ‘The Neck’.\nThis spot provides arguably the most iconic view of Bruny Island, and you can get gorgeous 360 degree views over the island. It is incredible how far you can see.\nThe lookout is named after a woman widely considered to have been the last full-blooded Aboriginal Tasmanian, Truganini.\nSadly herself and her family suffered terrible cruelty at the hands of colonial settlers, as did all of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population.\nDespite its horrendous past, it is great to see Bruny Island honouring and acknowledging Truganini.\nThe lookout is a great spot to visit for sunset or sunrise, especially if the sky lights up.\nYou get beautiful views over Isthmus Bay, Great Bay and Adventure Bay. You can see for miles on a clear day.\n8) Visit the Penguin Rookery\nWhile you’re hanging out at The Neck, you’ll have the chance to see the fairy penguins at night at the penguin rookery.\nThis is a magical experience, and should not be missed when ticking off all the incredible things to do on Bruny Island.\nPark at the Truganini Lookout car park and instead of climbing up to the lookout head to the beach on the boardwalk. After a short time, you will find yourself at the rookery.\nThe penguins come up to the beach one by one from the sea and climb up the below rock formation that resembles a wave.\nThey waddle up, hop into their little cave and then they finish waddling over to their partner or chicks.\nPenguins will nest just about anywhere they can find a spot that is out of the wind and with access to the water.\nYou can only see the little penguins from September and April, and after dusk. But of course, fairy penguins don’t follow a clock, so you may have to wait an hour or two after dusk before they appear.\nWe went 2 nights in a row and only saw them on the second night as we left too early on the first.\nMake sure you have a red light to not disturb them, and as with any wildlife, please keep your distance and don’t approach them or leave the platform.\n9) Learn About the Cape Bruny Lighthouse\nAt the end of the road on Bruny Island, you’ll come across its most famous attraction – the Cape Bruny Lighthouse.\nThe 114m tall\nlighthouse was built in 1836, towers over the spectacular dolerite cliffs of Cape Bruny and offers panoramic views of the rugged South Bruny coastline.\nYou can’t actually go inside the Cape Bruny Lighthouse on your own, but if you would like you can join a private tour and go up with a guide.\nThe tour guide will take you up to the top of the Cape Bruny Lighthouse where you can get an even better view and learn all about the history of the building.\nIf you are\ninto astrophotography (use our photography guide to help you get the best images), this is a great spot too because there’s no light pollution (except for the lighthouse of course), and looking south there’s no land until you hit Antarctica!\nThe last part of the road out to the Cape Bruny Lighthouse is not smooth so be aware. A 2WD car can easily get out there but the road has a lot of corrugations on it.\n10) Hike the Luggaboine Circuit\n- Location: Labillardiere Peninsula near Lighthouse Jetty Beach.\n- Distance: 4km loop\n- Time: 1.5 – 2 hours\nIf you’re looking for more hikes to do on Bruny Island, you’re in luck because this one is a beauty!\nThe Luggaboine Circuit is the easy, shorter 4km circuit walk on the Labillardiere Peninsula in South Bruny National Park, heading out to Standaway Bay and Great Taylors Bay.\nAlong the way, you’ll find all kinds of wildlife, lush scenery, high cliffs, interesting caves and picturesque natural rock pools.\nThe path starts from the picnic area carpark in South Bruny National Park. From here follow the well signed path that will take you to Standaway Bay first.\nAfter walking about 2km you will come to a fork. This is where you will cut across the peninsula to the other side where you get great views of Great Taylors Bay.\nThis is an easy walk which is great for all ages. If you want to extend your walk and make a day of it, check out the Labillardiere Peninsula Circuit below, which is the larger loop on the peninsula.\n11) Hike the Whole Labillardiere Peninsula Circuit\n- Location – South Bruny National Park near Lighthouse Jetty Beach\n- Distance – 18km loop\n- Duration – 5 – 6.5 hours\nOne of the best free things to do on Bruny Island is tackle the whole Labillardiere Peninsula Circuit, a fantastic, long and varied walk around the picturesque Labillardiere Peninsula in South Bruny National Park.\nIt is one of the\n60 Great Short Walks of Tasmania, if you are ticking that list off (and you should be).\nAlong this stretch, you’ll find constant coastal views mixed with mountain vistas as well as stretches of beautiful sandy beaches, perfect for relaxation or exploration.\nThis low-level stroll also provides an excellent opportunity to see wildlife such as wallabies, parrots, marine life and other colourful flora like wildflowers, including orchids!\nFrom the Jetty Beach campground, you’re taken west along a 4WD track for views of rugged mountains in Tasmania’s southern ranges as well as deserted rock spree beaches that are worth checking out.\nContinuing onwards, Mount Bleak is climbed up next with its first glimpses of Partridge Island – home to the rare forty-spotted Pardalote (a bird that has seen an alarming decline).\nREAD MORE: For one of Australia’s best hikes, don’t miss out on the\nThree Capes Track in Tasmania!\nAlong the hike you will pass Point Labillardiere, Hopwood Point, Hopwood Beach and Botlers Beach, which all offer great views.\nYou will follow the path back towards Lighthouse Jetty Beach with nice views over Great Taylors Bay.\nThis hike will take you between 5 – 6.5 hours return so be prepared with enough water and snacks or lunch. There are no facilities along the way.\nThere are drop toilets at the Jetty Campground where you start and end your hike.\n12) Bruny Island Cruises\nIf you want to see the breathtaking coastline from the water, then\nthis is the tour you need to take.\nBruny Island Cruises has a 3 Hour Wilderness Cruise that explores the rugged cliffs and beaches of the island.\nYou’ll cruise alongside some of Australia’s highest sea cliffs, beneath towering crags and drift up close to listen to the awesome ‘Breathing Rock’.\nYou sail past sea caves and cruise through the narrow gap between coast and “The Monument”, feel nature at its most powerful point where the Tasman Sea meets Southern Ocean.\nYou may see seals, dolphins, migrating whales (depending on the season) or even penguins! Bruny Island Cruises does a great job of letting tourists see the real wilderness around Bruny Island.\nThis is the best way to find out about this area and learn the history of when the Tasmanian Aboriginal people first inhabited this beautiful area over 2000 years ago.\n13) Get Into the Oysters at Get Shucked!\nGet Shucked is all about a truly authentic, amazing oyster experience. Head on down to Bruny and drop into\nGet Shucked for some fresh oysters!\nGet Shucked is a company that specialises in Australian oysters that come from the waters of the D’Entrecasteaux channel and are grown for 6-12 months.\nThe end product, an elite Pacific Oyster, has noticeable sweet flavours with full body and briny meat. Or so they say.\nWe personally did not try them as we are vegetarians, but if you love your seafood and want to try some fresh oysters, check these guys out.\n14) Have a Nip at the Bruny Island House of Whisky\nIf you are a whisky or gin lover, before you get back on the ferry to head back to the mainland, check out the\nHouse of Whiskey.\nThese guys have a tremendous passion and endless knowledge of whiskey and gin, and you can learn all about it by trying out one of their tasting paddles.\nIf you’ve ever wanted to pick up a bottle of Tasmanian Single Malt, Bruny Island House of Whisky is the place to do it on your trip around the state.\nBruny Island Travel Guide\nNow that you know all the things to do on Bruny Island, let’s dive into some extra information to help you make the most of your visit.\nFrom where to stay to how to get here, and the best places to visit during a trip to Bruny Island, we have you covered.\nWhere to Stay – Accommodation on Bruny Island\nBruny Island Tasmania is a perfect destination if you are looking for a place to relax and unwind.\nThere are many types of accommodation available on Bruny Island, making it possible for everyone to stay comfortably no matter the budget.\nThe cost of accommodation ranges from basic campsites to luxury lodges and hotels.\nCamping on Bruny Island\nThere are a couple of places to camp on the island.

    "text": "Kesha & Lil Nas X Announce Duet, Her First New Song Since Parting Ways With Dr. Luke\nKesha is gearing up to drop her first new single since parting ways with Dr. Luke, and it’s going to be a collaboration with Lil Nas X.\nThe 36-year-old “Die Young” pop star confirmed that\nshe was moving on from her deal with Dr. Luke, who she had previously accused of mistreatment and sexual assault. The pair reached a settlement in their legal battle in the summer of 2023 and concluded their contract in December.\nOn Friday (January 5), the “Industry Baby” rapper, 24, revealed that they were dropping a new track together within a week’s time.\nRead more about Kesha and Lil Nas X’s collab…\nIn a\npost on Instagram, Lil Nas shared a photo of Kesha holding a sign that said “New music coming soon!” He paired it with a picture of himself holding up a handwritten sign that read “What she said!”\n“Next Friday,” he added cryptically in the caption.\nThe rapper has also been interacting with fans discussing the single on X (formerly Twitter). He\nreposted one fan that said the pair was going to “drop the biggest song of 2024.”\nBoth Kesha and Lil Nas have been teasing new material recently.\nLil Nas in particular sparked a conversation after teasing that he had\nentered his “Christian era,” a fact he then had to defend after he was accused of “playing with God.”\nHe also just\nslammed people who have things to say about his most controversial music video to date.",

Not long after, analysts at Piper Sandler cut their price target by $15 to $205, contending that \"growth rates have peaked for unit sales.\"\nAnd Microsoft is now nipping at its heels\nfor the position of most valuable company.\nShares of Apple at last check Friday were little changed just above $182.\nRelated: Prominent investor foresees a lot of Big Tech acquisitions in 2024\nNot all analysts have taken a dour outlook on the stock. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has predicted that Apple will shoot beyond a\n$4 trillion market cap this year.\nAnd Deepwater Management's Gene Munster\nexpects this year to be a strong one for Apple, with the coming release of the Vision Pro headset, artificial intelligence upgrades on their way to the Siri virtual assistant, and what he expects to be at least one big-name acquisition: Peloton ( PTON) - https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=PTON. Related: Apple has a fierce new competitor: a rising tech mogul\nWhy Peloton makes sense for Apple\nThe stars, Munster said, are lining up for Apple to acquire Peloton, the connected exercise-and-fitness company whose stock has fallen hard from pandemic-era highs. In 2021 shares of Peloton were trading above $150; the stock at last check was up 1.7% at $6.23.\nPeloton, Munster told\nCNBC, is a hardware, software and services company, a trifecta for which Apple has become well-known. And Apple, meanwhile, is working to expand its subscription revenue.\nThe tech giant currently has six subscription products: Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple News, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness and iCloud Plus. Together they account for roughly $16 billion in total revenue, 4% of Apple's overall revenue.\nIf the company is able to maintain Peloton's roughly 3-million-strong user base, which brings in about $1.7 billion in revenue, Apple could add around 11% to its subscription piece, according to Munster.\n\"It was almost five years ago today that (Apple CEO) Tim Cook famously said that Apple's greatest contribution to humanity will be related to health,\" Munster said. \"They've been teasing around Apple Watch; they have a fitness product that basically no one uses. And this is an opportunity.\"\nPlus, the stock is cheap.\n\"If Apple pays a 50% premium, they'd be paying two times subscription revenue. Apple's trading at seven times revenue,\" Munster said. \"If you're trading at seven times revenue and you can buy a business that fits nicely in for two times revenue, you make that acquisition.\"\n\"So I think this is the year,\" he added.\nThe average analyst price target for Peloton is $7.38, implying a bit of possible upside.\nOn Thursday Peloton launched a partnership with TikTok to bring its fitness content to the short-form-video platform.\nContact Ian with tips via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.\nRelated: Montana declares war on one popular social media app\nGet exclusive access to portfolio managersâ€™ stock picks and proven investing strategies with\nReal Money Pro.

You can literally eat it within 15 minutes of starting the recipe. If you store it in the fridge, though, it will settle even more when it gets cold.\n- Easiest strawberry jam you’ll ever make. If you’ve never made jam before, this is a great recipe to start with because it’s so simple. You don’t need any special equipment or ingredients, and it comes together quickly.\n- It’s healthy and delicious. This strawberry chia jam is not only healthier than traditional jam because it has no refined sugar, but it also tastes great!\n- Great way to use up strawberries. If you have strawberries that are starting to go bad, this is a great way to use them up. You can also freeze the strawberries and save them for later to use in this recipe.\ningredients to make chia jam\n- Strawberries: This recipe uses frozen strawberries, but you can also use fresh strawberries. If you use frozen strawberries, there’s no need to thaw them first.\n- Chia Seeds: Chia seeds is what helps this jam thicken up and become more like a traditional jam. Chia seeds are also a great source of fiber and omega-fatty acids.\n- Lime Juice: The lime juice adds a little bit of tartness to the jam. You can also use lemon juice if you prefer.\n- Vanilla Extract: The vanilla extract adds a nice depth of flavor to the jam, but is also optional.\n- Maple Syrup: Maple syrup is used to sweeten the jam. You can also use honey or agave nectar if you prefer.\nHow to make strawberry chia jam\n- To start, you basically use fresh or frozen strawberries, throw in some lime juice and water and simmer it all together.\n- When the strawberries start to break down, use a fork to mash them and help release their juices.\n- Next, you’ll add in some chia seeds, maple syrup, vanilla extract, chia seeds, and lime zest and stir until combined, about 30 seconds.\n- What happens is when the chia seeds get heated and those tiny seeds naturally thicken the strawberries into a jelly-like spread.\nTips for making strawberry chia jam\n- Puree the strawberries for a smoother jam. If you want a smoother jam, you can use an immersion blender to puree the strawberries after they’ve been cooked down.\n- Add more or less sweetener to taste. This recipe is lightly sweetened, but you can add more or less maple syrup to taste. You can always add more, so when in doubt, start with less.\n- Use glass storage jars. Plastic can sometimes leach unwanted flavors into food (i.e., that garlic spaghetti you saved last week may not taste so good with your chia jam). If you have a glass mason jar, use that instead.\n- Let it set in the fridge for a few hours. If you can resist eating the jam right away, letting the jam set in the fridge for a few hours will allow it to thicken even more, and the flavors will meld together.\npopular substitutions & additions\n- Switch up the fruit. This chia jam recipe can be made with any type of fruit. Just cook the fruit down with some lime juice and water until soft and then add in the chia seeds.\n- Omit the sweetener or change it up. You don’t have to use sweetener in this jam. It will just be less like a traditional jam. You can also use honey or agave nectar if you prefer.\n- Use fresh strawberries instead of frozen. You can substitute the frozen strawberries with 1lb of fresh. You’ll want to cut the cooking time down since fresh strawberries are already softer.\nwhat to serve with your chia jam\nHuevos Rancheros with Sweet Potatoes Souffle Omelette Chocolate Hazelnut Smoothie Bowl Broccoli and Cheese Quiche\n- Or try spreading it on English muffins, on top of\nhttps://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/banana-pancakes/or https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/cauliflower-waffles/, or swirled it on yogurt.\nhow to store this chia jam recipe\nStore your jam in an air-tight container, preferably glass, in the fridge.\nhow long will chia jam last in the fridge?\nThis chia jam recipe will last in the fridge for up to two weeks.

Chia seeds are what help this jam thicken up and become more like a traditional jam. Pectin will also make the jam very thick and gel-like, but the cooking and setup process is different.\nFirst, make sure you’re using enough chia seeds. I would start with at least three tablespoons. If that doesn’t work, you can cook the jam down for a little longer or add more chia seeds.\nYes, this recipe can easily be doubled.

    "text": "Past Lives isn’t on Netflix, but you can still watch it (and cry along) right now There's plenty of rent and purchase options available to check out the romantic drama now. Romantic drama film Past Lives is up for five [Golden Globes](https://netflixlife.com/posts/emma-stone-mesmerizing-poor-things-cant-watch-on-netflix), and I'm completely unsurprised! The achingly heartfelt story about two childhood sweethearts who reconnect years later. It's one of the sweetest movies to come out of 2023. The yearning looks and the obvious connection between Nora Moon and Hae Sung really get the waterworks going! Unfortunately, the beautifully crafted film [isn't available to stream on Netflix](https://netflixlife.com/posts/the-holdovers-is-newly-streaming-just-not-on-netflix). But, you'll definitely want to check it out if you haven't already. Thankfully, there are a few on-demand options to do so! Past Lives is available to rent or purchase on Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, and Vudu. We shared a breakdown of the choices available below: [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Past-Lives-Greta-Lee/dp/B0CBHDBRF2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8YMFN6JEUU7G&keywords=past+lives&qid=1704488371&s=instant-video&sprefix=past+live%2Cinstant-video%2C276&sr=1-1)- rent for $5.99 or buy for $19.99 - YouTube - rent between $4.99 and $7.99 or buy for $19.99 - Google Play - rent for $4.99 or buy for $19.99 - Apple TV - rent for $5.99 or buy for $19.99 [Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/browse/details/Past-Lives/2373472?cmp=OrganicSearch~Vudu~GoogleWatch)- rent for $4.99 or buy for $19.99 Honestly it doesn't really matter which platform you choose to rent or purchase the movie. It all comes down to a matter of preference. I personally like to rent films on Prime Video or Vudu. While it's not streaming anywhere right now, that doesn't mean it won't later on. Where could that be? Where will Past Lives stream in the future? In December 2023, Warner Bros. and production company A24 came to a deal to give the former exclusivity in streaming their films. That means going forward, all A24 projects will be going to HBO or Max. While a timeline hasn't been established just yet, I'm hopeful Past Lives will be streaming on Max soon! Now that the season for bigger award shows has kicked off with the Golden Globes on Jan. 7, 2024, I really don't think Max is going to wait much longer to add Past Lives to its catalog. When films get that buzzworthy attention from awards shows, they tend to come to streaming during or right after a ceremony if it's not already available to watch online. Just so you're prepared when the time comes, here's how you can get your hands on a Max subscription. How to sign up for Max - Visit the [Max sign up page](https://auth.max.com/product) - Select With Ads ($9.99/month), Ad-Free ($15.99/month), or Ultimate Ad-Free (19.99/month) - Create an account by entering a username and password - Enter your chosen payment method - Login to start watching! Past Lives is directed and written by Celine Song, who is also up for a [Golden Globes 2024 ](https://goldenglobes.com/nominations/2024)nomination! The movie has been nominated in a total of five categories including Best Motion Picture - Drama; Best Motion Picture – Non-English Language; Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama (Greta Lee); Best Director - Motion Picture (Celine Song); and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture (Celine Song). I'll be honest. I do think the movie has a shot of winning in the Best Motion Picture – Non-English Language, and even possibly lead actress Greta Lee in the Best Performance by a Female Actor section. Though the others might be a bit tough. The film is contending with Oppenheimer, as well as Barbie's Greta Gerwig. There's so many great productions to cheer on. It's so hard to pick! Be sure to cheer on Past Lives at the Golden Globes Sunday, Jan. 7, 2024 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+ with Showtime.",

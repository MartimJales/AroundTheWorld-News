    "text": "Looking good in Fortnite is one of the biggest things you have to worry about before you jump into a match. With so many skins to pick from in this massive battle royale, you might not want to pick your favorite but the rarest skin you’ve unlocked while playing.\nThere are multiple rare skins that have appeared in Fortnite over the years, and these were only offered for a limited time. If you have one of these rare skins on your account, donning them to show off in a battle royale match is always a good idea. Some rare skins may be ones players have never heard about before. These are some of the rarest skins you can own in Fortnite.\nAerial Assault Trooper Image via Epic Games The Aerial Assault Trooper initially appeared during Fortnite season one. It was available for 1,200 V-bucks , and you had to reach at least level 15 in the Season Shop before the skin became available. Although the skin is not fancy compared to some that have come to Fortnite now, because of how few players have this skin on their account, it’s one of the rarer ones to see in the game, and we’d love to see if it could appear again sometime in the future, potentially with a rework.\nBlack Knight Image via Epic Games When Fortnite players think of a rare skin you could have, many immediately think of the Black Knight. The Black Knight was a character that appeared during Season 2 of Fortnite , and was a level 70 reward on the season’s battle pass. There have been several iterations of this skin, such as a unique twist on the outfit for Fortnite ‘s OG Season , but nothing that matches the eerie black and silver armor suit with glowing red eyes. Outside of participating in Season 2 of Fortnite and unlocking the skin, it has not appeared in the game since.\nBlue Team Leader Image via Epic Games For Fortnite players playing on PlayStation, the Blue Team Leader skin was another opportunity to grab an exclusive item. The Blue Team Leader skin appeared when Epic Games promoted Fortnite on PlayStation, and it was available to PlayStation Plus subscribers who had access to the game. It was called the PlayStation Plus Celebration Pack, and you could grab it on the PlayStation store. However, that promotion has since been pulled, and the Blue Team Leader skin has not been openly available since February 2018.\nEon Image via Microsoft The Eon skin was initially released during Fortnite’s Season 6 and was in partnership with Epic Games and Microsoft. You can still purchase this skin if you’re willing to buy the Xbox One S 1 TB console, which you can find on Amazon but features a different appearance from the original Eon. Microsoft promoted the original bundle for $299.99, but the price has gone up as the console and promotion have been discontinued.\nGalaxy Image via Epic Games A partnership between Samsung and Epic Games for Fortnite brought about the Galaxy skin, a character that looks like they were dropped directly from space. Fortnite players had a chance to unlock this skin if they played at least three games while using their Note 9 and Tab4 tablets, and if you did not have those devices and never played the game, you couldn’t unlock the Galaxy skin. The Galaxy is exceptionally rare because of the time constraints on the promotional event and the devices required to unlock it.\nGolden Agent Peely Image via Epic Games For those who wanted to push themselves during Fortnite Chapter 2: Season 2, there’s the Golden Agent Peely skin. The skin was available in the battle pass, but you had to reach level 300 to unlock it. If you had the time and patience to unlock it before Chapter 2: Season 2 arrived, the skin would be available for you to use. It’s an exceptionally rare skin because of the amount of time you would have had to dedicate to unlock it, despite how long Fortnite seasons usually go .\nHonor Guard Image via Epic Games In a promotion between Epic Games and Honor, the Honor Guard skin is one of the rarer and more expensive skins you can find in Fortnite . If you wanted this skin, you had to buy the Honor View 20, a phone that cost $650 in January 2019 when it was released, and the Honor Guard skin became available in February 2019 for anyone who grabbed the promotional code. Outside of this promotion, the Honor Guard skin has not appeared in Fortnite , making it an exceptionally rare skin and one of the odder promotions Epic Games has done for Fortnite players. What made this skin even more rare was that the promotion was not worldwide.\nThe Reaper Image via Epic Games One of my favorite skins is The Repear, and many Fortnite players refer to this character as “John Wick,” who looks eerily similar to the character played by Keanu Reaves. Many people believe it’s the best Fortnite skin available. However, it’s important to note that this skin differs from the John Wick skin released in Season 9 to promote the third John Wick film. The Reaper appeared in Fortnite during Season 3 and was the tier 100 reward for the battle pass.\nReflex Image via Epic Games The Reflex skin was created during Fortnite ‘s Season 7, and you could grab it from the item shop for 1,200 V-Bucks in the Counterattack set. However, another way to unlock it was by submitting a code from the GeForce Fortnite Bundle, which was back in 2019. The Reflex outfit has only appeared in the Item Shop twice and was last seen in March 2019. Unless you have a promotional code for the GeForce Fortnite Bundle, we don’t know another way to unlock this rare skin.\nWorld Warrior Image via Epic Games The World Warrior skin appeared during Fortnite ‘s Season 9 and was available in the item shop for 800 V-Bucks. It was one of the items you could unlock for the World Cup 2019 set. It appeared four times in the item shop but only occurred in July 2019. Because the World Warrior skin appeared briefly during this time, it’s a relatively rare skin that only a handful of players had who might have grabbed it before it disappeared.\nAuthor Scott Duwe Staff Writer & Call of Duty lead.

    "text": "Beauty Each one is cuter than the next. While 2023 was most definitely the year of the bow, the coquette aesthetic will still be on-trend in 2024, especially in the tattoo world. Case in point? [Hailey Bieber](https://www.bustle.com/style/hailey-bieber-tattoos), the queen of micro ink, recently debuted the most classic coquette tat you can get: a dainty, [fine-line bow](https://www.bustle.com/beauty/hailey-bieber-bow-tattoo). As the [queen of balletcore](https://www.bustle.com/beauty/hailey-bieber-sugar-plum-fairy-holiday-makeup), Bieber has been adding dancerly details, like [ribbons and bows](https://www.bustle.com/style/bow-hair-accessories), to her look for years. But according to [Anastasiia Gatsko](https://www.instagram.com/nastyagtattoo/), a tattoo artist and owner of [G Tattoo & Piercing](https://gtattoo.ca/), bows aren’t the only way to lean into the coquette vibe. Hearts, pearls, cherubs, and other dainty details also fall under the [coquette aesthetic](https://www.bustle.com/style/coquette-nails#:~:text=According%20to%20nail%20artist%20Queenie,top%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20tells%20Bustle.). Plus, there are multiple ways to rock a ribbon, whether you go for a [fine-line design](https://www.bustle.com/style/fine-line-tattoo) or one that’s more realistic. If the result is flirty, playful, and romantic, you can consider it coquette. Keep scrolling for 13 cute coquette tattoo ideas to inspire your next piece of body art.

    "text": "The families of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are apparently overjoyed for the couple as their relationship becomes more committed. One could say they're practically in-laws now, seeing how intertwined their lives have became. The couple's families \" [are both on board](https://pagesix.com/2024/01/04/celebrity-news/travis-kelce-and-taylor-swifts-families-have-never-seen-them-so-happy-report/)\" with their affair, according to an insider who spoke with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday. \"Everyone on Travis' side loves Taylor and vice versa.\" \"Everyone is in a supportive dynamic,\" the person said. \"Their loved ones hope and believe that it will continue because they have never seen either of them so happy.\" The 34-year-old Swift and Kelce began dating throughout the summer, and in September, when the \"Cruel Summer\" singer went to her first Kansas City Chiefs game, they made their relationship public. She has now established herself as a bit of a fixture in the stands, frequently supporting him on the tight end with his parents, Ed and Donna Kelce.

Due to Taylor's tour schedule, they had to work remotely when they first started dating, but since she took a break in November, they have spent a lot of time together. The Chiefs star and the singer of \"Anti-Hero\" are \"closer than ever before and everyone around them can see that they're an amazing match,\" the insider claims. The source said, \"They cherish the small things in life and love being together no matter what they're doing.\" \"As a couple, they strive to live as normal lives as they can, and they're enjoying the upswing and development in their relationship.\" They said, \"They think this is their time and that timing is everything.\" Swift herself spoke [in a December interview with Time](https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a46051779/taylor-swift-first-travis-kelce-romance-interview-joe-alwyn-years/) about her comfort in being more public with Kelce. \"When you say a relationship is public, that means I'm going to see him do what he loves, we're showing up for each other, other people are there and we don't care,\" she said. \"The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you're seeing someone. And we're just proud of each other.\" After dating for six years, Swift and her last long-term partner, Joe Alwyn, called it quits in March. Before starting a private relationship with Kelce in July, Swift had a brief relationship with musician Matty Healy in May and June. At his Kansas City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears in late September, they made their relationship public, and since then, their romance has been on the fast track. \"We actually had a significant amount of time [dating privately] that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,\" Swift told Time. \"By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\" ALSO READ: [Taylor Swift's Smudged Lipstick Sparks Discussion Among Swifties](https://www.musictimes.com/articles/99278/20240103/taylor-swifts-smudged-lipstick-sparks-discussion-among-swifties.htm)",

    "text": "Balsamic Roasted Carrots add vibrant color and bold flavor to any dinner! It‚Äôs an easy side dish recipe roasted in the oven with white balsamic vinegar, honey, and garlic mixture. To finish, toss the roasted carrots in a sweet and tangy honey balsamic reduction for the perfect flavor pop.\nEnjoy more of the best carrot recipes like\nHoney Butter Glazed Carrots and Honey Roasted Carrots.\nTable of Contents\nFor every holiday dinner, I make sure to serve several fresh vegetable dishes. Be it\nGreen Beans, Brussels Sprouts, carrots, mixed roasted vegetables, or salads. Whichever sides I choose, fresh veggies are always present to help balance all of the heartier dishes!\nIf I had to choose a favorite, green beans and carrots are my top vegetable side choices. Both are delicious when mixed with a lot of different flavors, whether you go with savory flavor additions or sweeter ones. They‚Äôre wonderful with sweet flavors like honey, maple, and orange glaze, just as much as savory flavors like garlic, butter, and herbs.\nThis easy roasted carrots recipe takes baby carrots and elevates them to a whole new level! They‚Äôre tender as can be while still being just crisp enough to give the best bite. White balsamic vinegar, honey, olive oil, garlic, thyme, and just a small sprinkle of salt create the most amazing flavor that can compliment a number of different entrees.\nIngredient Notes\nBaby Carrots ‚Äì It‚Äôs best to use fresh carrots! Baby carrots are nice and easy but you can also chop whole carrots if that‚Äôs what you have on hand.\nHoney ‚Äì Try to use a good quality honey if possible for the best flavor.\nGarlic ‚Äì Fresh garlic is best! It gives the dish a nice aroma and subtle garlicky taste.\nOlive Oil ‚Äì You can swap this with avocado oil if you‚Äôd like.\nSee recipe card for complete information on ingredients and quantities.\nHow to Make Balsamic Roasted Carrots\nWhisk. Combine the vinegar, honey, oil, pressed garlic, thyme, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together to combine.\nToss the carrots. Add all of the carrots to the mixing bowl. Toss it all together to coat the carrots evenly (1).\nPrepare for baking. Spread the carrots in a single layer on a prepared baking sheet (2).\nRoast the carrots. Cook the carrots at 425¬∞F for 20-30 minutes (3).\nMake the glaze. Whisk white balsamic vinegar and honey together in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer. Stir often until the mixture reduces and thickens. Then, take the pot off of the heat and pour the glaze into a bowl. Set aside until the carrots are done roasting.\nPRO TIP: For this recipe, don‚Äôt reduce the vinegar mixture too much since it‚Äôs meant to coat carrots rather than be a drizzle.\nGlaze the carrots. Once carrots are cooked, transfer them into a serving dish and pour the reduction over the top (4). Mix until carrots are coated in vinegar reduction. Add the glaze.\nCan I use regular balsamic vinegar?\nYes, you can use regular balsamic vinegar, but I highly recommend using white balsamic.\nI‚Äôve made these carrots with both types of vinegar and white one goes much better with carrots. It also tastes much more pleasant.\nWhite balsamic vinegar is milder, sweeter, and it has a fruitier finish. When combined with honey, it goes a lot better with sweetness of carrots.\nStoring Recommendation\nStore any leftovers you may have in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for about 3-4 days. The best part is that roasted carrots are easy to reheat in the microwave, but even better when reheated on your stove-top. On the stove-top, just reheat the carrots over medium heat until warmed through.\nRecipe FAQs\nYes, absolutely! Either chopped or whole carrots will go well with this recipe. If you want to use whole carrots, it‚Äôs best to choose young, thin carrots and make sure to peel them first. If you happen to have large, thick carrots, it‚Äôs best to chop them first. Chop them on a diagonal into about 1/2-1-inch thick pieces. Remember, it‚Äôs important to keep all the pieces as close to the same thickness as possible so it all cooks through evenly.\nIt‚Äôs better to roast root and dense vegetables like carrots at 425¬∞F. This is a good temperature to get the outside nice and caramelized or crispy, and keep the inside nicely cooked through and fork-tender. When it comes to time, it highly depends on the size and the cut of the vegetables. It also depends on how soft you like the carrots to be. Baby carrots and smaller whole carrots will take about 15-25 minutes. Larger, and thicker carrots can take up to 35 minutes, especially if you like them soft.\nThere are a number of entrees that go well with balsamic roasted carrots! Serve them as part of your holiday spread alongside something stunning like\nBaked Ham with Orange Honey Ham Glaze or Beef Tenderloin. Or, go for something more untraditional but still delicious like Spatchcock Chicken.\nMore Vegetable Side Dish Recipes\nPIN THIS RECIPE FOR LATER\nDID YOU MAKE THIS RECIPE?

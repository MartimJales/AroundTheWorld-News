Below Deck Adventure star Faye Clarke announced last month that she had welcomed her first child, surprising fans after the Bravo star decided to keep her pregnancy out of the public eye until after she had given birth.\nThe reality personality, who first appeared on Season 1 of the Below Deck spinoff in 2022, took to Instagram in December to announce the news of her pregnancy and the birth of her daughter Brianna Maddox. \"For all those that have supported me over the past 9 months checking in on me! Msging, calling, visiting and caring, Helping me move into my new home!

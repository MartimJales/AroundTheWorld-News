    "text": "Singer-songwriter Jhene Aiko released her new song Sun/Son which is without a doubt about her son Noah with Big Sean as well as about the biggest star in our universe. She references how the sun charges her up and helps her start her day. In an Instagram post on Nov. 9, Aiko teased this song in a video and captioned the dedicated birthday post to her son saying, \"️this is for my favorite boy/my sweet and silly Noah Woahwah/mama's baby... my Sun/Son ️\" She sings, \"I prayed out loud and there you were\" meaning she prayed for brighter days and for something to wake up and motivate her only to open her eyes and have her son greet her was life-changing. Throughout the song, Aiko references how her son has changed her life for the better and how despite everything that has happened she is eternally grateful to be his mother while also acknowledging his father's features. The two-minute and 57-seconds long song is a heartwarming and gentle reminder to her son that he is loved and has altered her life for the better in ways he doesn't know yet",

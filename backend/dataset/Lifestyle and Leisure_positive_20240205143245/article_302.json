    "text": "Mike McCready says producer Andrew Watt helped Pearl Jam change things up when recording their new album.\nMcCready told Classic Rock that “When we were in the studio with him this past year, he really kicked our asses, got us focused and playing, song after song. It took a long time to make Gigaton , but this new one didn’t take long. Andrew was like: ‘You guys take forever to make records. Let’s do this, right now.’”\nMcCready said that the new songs are \"a lot heavier than you’d expect. There’s the melody and energy of the first couple of records. Andrew pushed us to play as hard and melodic and thoughtful as we’ve done in a long time. I feel like Matt Cameron ’s drumming has elements of what he did in Soundgarden .\"\nAnd McCready added that “for better or worse, you’re gonna hear a lot more lead guitar from me -- stuff I haven’t done in a long time.”\nThe new as-yet-untitled album is expected out in the middle of the year.\nFriday, January 5, 2024 - 10:07 AM\nhttps://bit.ly/3RLcJqf\nMiek McCready says producer Andrew Watt really inspied Pearl Jam for their new LP. bit.ly/3RLcJqf\nPublish Date Timestamp\nFri, 01/05/2024 - 10:07",

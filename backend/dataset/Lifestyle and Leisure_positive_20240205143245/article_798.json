    "text": "Finally‚Ä¶ [Megan Moroney](http://whiskeyriff.com/tag/meg-moroney) confirmed that she has a new single dropping this month, one she‚Äôs been teasing out on the road for quite a while now called [‚ÄúNo Caller ID.‚Äù](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/12/22/megan-moroney-teases-another-new-song-no-caller-id/) The breakup song has a really unique concept, which finds Meg‚Äôs ex finding new ways to contact her, though through the verses in the song, she eventually realizes she‚Äôs moved on enough and doesn‚Äôt want to pick up the call with ‚Äúno caller ID‚Äù anymore. She shared a teaser of the studio cut over on TikTok earlier, and I think it‚Äôs such a great song that I can‚Äôt wait to hear in its entirety, in the form it will likely be included in on the next record. A fan in the comments asked her if she‚Äôd ‚Äúrelease soon,‚Äù and Meg replied: ‚ÄúHow about this month?‚Äù We don‚Äôt have an exact date quite yet, but seeing as we‚Äôre already almost one week into January, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have to wait too much longer: Check it out: [@megmoroney]ft the waterbugs üòé [#nocallerID] [‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Megan Moroney] Meg also perviously noted that she‚Äôs [‚Äúalmost done‚Äù](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/12/18/megan-moroney-teases-heartbreaker-called-28th-of-june-says-shes-almost-done-writing-next-album/) writing her second album, and teased another unreleased song a few weeks back called ‚Äú28th of June‚Äù that is equally as beautiful, and I hope to get to hear on her sophomore project: Today, the Georgia native released a perfect cover of Chris Stapleton‚Äôs supremely underrated deep cut [‚ÄúWhat Are You Listening To?‚Äù](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2024/01/05/megan-moroney-releases-perfect-studio-cover-of-chris-stapletons-what-are-you-listening-to/)",

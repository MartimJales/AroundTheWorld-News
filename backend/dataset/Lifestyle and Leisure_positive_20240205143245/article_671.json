    "text": "[Gy](http://www.gymguyz.com/north-dfw) [mguyz](https://www.gymguyz.com/north-dfw/#~0A8g4M7), a mobile personal training company, is launching a new service area Jan. 12 for some North Texas cities. The gist The company specializes in customized fitness programs, including strength, cardio, sports conditioning, weight loss and toning. For each workout, certified personal trainers bring all the equipment straight to the customers’ doors. Trainers can also lead group fitness classes at apartment complexes, businesses, schools and more, according to its website. The new territory includes service in the following cities: - Carrollton - Colleyville - The Colony - Coppell - Flower Mound - Fort Worth - Grapevine - Keller - Lewisville - Roanoke - Southlake Father-son duo Bowen and Guy Creamer are leading the new service area as franchise owners. When Guy Creamer, the son, moved to Fort Worth about a year ago, he saw the idea of mobile trainers hadn’t taken off in the market yet. “It was a great opportunity, and so we went ahead and pulled the trigger with it,” he said. Bowen Creamer said he knew his son wanted to stay in the fitness realm and open his own business. When they started considering franchise opportunities, Gymguyz business model stood out to Bowen Creamer. “I wanted a company that could also teach him along the way with their business model,” Bowen Creamer said. One more thing Gymguyz is hosting a grand opening ceremony Jan. 25 at the Southlake Chamber of Commerce. Guy and Bowen Creamer are partnering with the [Wounded Warrior Project](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/)to raise money for the nonprofit. More information about the opening can be found on the Southlake Chamber of Commerce’s [website](https://www.southlakechamber.com/events/details/ribbon-cutting-for-gymguyz-22587). - Opening Jan. 12 [www.gymguyz.com/north-dfw](http://www.gymguyz.com/north-dfw)",

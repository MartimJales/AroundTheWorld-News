    "text": "All good Metroidvanias must eventually make their way to Nintendo Switch, and that’s the next stop for GRIME. Publisher Akupara Games and developer Clover Bite announced that the side-scrolling action-RPG is coming to Switch on January 25. This version of GRIME is now being billed as the Definitive Edition, offering “the complete GRIME experience” on Switch. In addition to the main game, the Switch port comes with all free pieces of DLC, including the third and final offering in Parting Shade. The latest addition follows the act of previous DLC Colors of Rot and Tinge of Terror, all evocatively named in a way that suits GRIME‘s, uh, grimy style. The devs describe Parting Shade as their “parting gift to you, our players.” According to an earlier tease, you’ll need to use every ability you have at your disposal to survive their own personal take on the Path of Pain, presumably referring to Hollow Knight‘s absurdly challenging sub-area. The DLC was first announced in September as the last thing they needed to work on before switching their attention to the Switch port and GRIME 2. GRIME first made its way to PC via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123050/GRIME/) in August 2021, and is also available through Epic Games Store and GOG, as well as on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Back when the demo was on the way to Steam, [we spoke with director Yarden Weissbrot](https://www.destructoid.com/grime-demo-steam-game-director-interview/) about the surreal creature-absorbing game’s unique progression style, difficulty level, and more. With this and the sequel on the way, it’s a good time to be into GRIME.",

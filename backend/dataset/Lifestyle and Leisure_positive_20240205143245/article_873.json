    "text": "Best products for meditation While getting fit remains one of the most popular New Year’s resolutions, this year, many people have committed to improving their mental wellness. As a result, they’re searching for new ways to manage stress, anxiety and burnout.\nMeditation can offer many benefits, from improving mood to boosting self-awareness. Many practitioners also report physical benefits from meditation, such as better sleeping habits.\nIf you’re new to meditation, you might not know where to start. Fortunately, you can begin at home with a few products that set the stage for peaceful practice.\nWhat is meditation? Meditation is a practice where you pause and focus on something in particular, whether it’s clearing your mind of negative thoughts or giving deeper thought to a project. When you meditate, you tune out the world around you to focus, decompress or collect yourself. There are several practices, including mindfulness, progressive relaxation, breath awareness, and guided and spiritual meditation. Generally speaking, meditation practices share the same core elements : a quiet, distraction-free area, a comfortable seated or lying position, focus and openness.\nAlthough meditation is a practice in and of itself, it’s often incorporated into other activities.\nWhat are the benefits of meditation? While most people are aware that meditation may have a calming, relaxing effect, it’s not the only benefit. In fact, there are as many physical benefits as there are emotional ones.\nEmotional benefits of meditation Studies show that meditation may help manage stress, increase patience, raise self-awareness and cope with stressful situations.\nFor creatives and professionals, meditation sometimes provides the much-needed “step back” to gain perspective on challenging projects. Children and adolescents may also benefit from meditation to manage their anxiety during stressful events, such as exams or competitions. Meditation is often considered a form of self-care, and many people practice it while they get massages or use skin care masks.\nPhysical benefits of meditation While meditation may improve your overall mood and well-being, it often affects your body at the chemical or physical level, too.\nOne of the top physical benefits of meditation is lowering blood pressure, which according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health , may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Meditation is often used as a way to improve sleep health, including for individuals with insomnia and depression. Recent studies also show that for some individuals, meditation may be effective as part of a pain management program.\nHow do I meditate? Meditation can be as simple or involved as you’d like it to be. Regardless, you can start by finding a calm, quiet location, whether it’s in your living room or a shady spot under a tree. Next, set up the space so it’s as peaceful as possible, which may include tidying the space, setting up aromatherapy candles or turning on relaxing music.\nAfter you’ve created a meditation space, it’s time to begin your practice. Find a relaxing position, seated or lying, that will be comfortable to maintain for several minutes. Once you’re comfortable, close your eyes and begin focusing on your breathing and body. What comes next, however, is entirely up to you.\nSome people meditate and focus only on their breathing, blocking out all other thoughts during their session. Others use breathing as a gentle springboard to enter a relaxed, concentrated phase where they focus on something specific. If you’re not sure which method to use, you can try guided meditation, where you listen to someone walk you through a breathing and thought process.\nTop 6 products for meditation [ Gaiam Meditation Cushion and Pillow Set ]\nEnjoy a comfortable seated position during meditation with this cushion and pillow set. They’re filled with organic buckwheat hull, which adapts and responds to your body.\n[ Amazon Echo Dot 5th-Generation ]\nPlace the Echo Dot in your meditation space and listen to relaxing music or guided meditation.

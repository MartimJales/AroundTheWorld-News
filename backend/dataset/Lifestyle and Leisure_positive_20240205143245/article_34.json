Lisset Velando, Vice President of Silvus, Inc., said she had already used Limpiar twice now for her Uptown Dallas apartment. \"Both times, my Limpiadors have done a fantastic job. They arrived on time, cleaned thoroughly, handled linen changes, and were always respectful and polite. I'll be using Limpiar again for future cleanings. Plus, communicating and booking with them is a breeze,\" shared Lisset. Blair Hendrix, the owner of Smatch North Texas, described Limpiar as a \"savior\" after a busy week. \"Today's Tidy experience was rough, but who cares? I'm raving about Kandi from Limpiar! She and her crew saved the day with a last-minute appointment, going above and beyond. They even removed toilet lids and sink handles! If you need cleaning help, Limpiar is the way to go,\" shared Blair. Limpiar, currently in beta testing, invites passionate and reliable cleaners to join its team in the DFW metro.

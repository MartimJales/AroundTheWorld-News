    "text": "I don’t know about you, but I’m claiming 2024 as the year of the dinner party. Truly, few things are better than having all of your besties over, whipping up a viral TikTok recipe, and getting wine drunk in the process. These are the best types of girls’ nights, IMHO. But, the thing is…you can’t have a killer dinner party in a subpar kitchen.\nLuckily, even if you’re a renter, there are plenty of ways to spruce up your kitchen and make it “wow, you actually live here?” chic, many of which don’t involve blowing major $$$. How, you ask? Well, I’ve got all the answers—and tips and tricks—because I spoke with a bunch of professional interior designers to bring you the top kitchen trends of 2024. All of these additions (both big and small) will turn your kitchen into the ultimate hangout spot—and your favorite room ever.\n“Kitchens are said to be the heart of the home, and 2024 is the year we really live that, because the biggest trends in the year ahead are anchored in connection and intention,” says therapist turned interior designer and author of Home Therapy, Anita Yokota.\nIf you’re ready for your kitchen to be the most enviable out of all your pals, keep reading, because the seven kitchen trends ahead will help turn your space into an oasis this year. Who knows, HGTV may just come knocking at your door…\nStatement Range Hoods\na kitchen with white cabinets\nRenters, scroll on by, because this upgrade is specifically for the homeowners…specifically those who are willing to drop a bit of moolah to make their kitchen sparkle. Trust me when I say your kitchen is worthy of a splurge, and the experts assured me that a statement range hood is super on-trend right now, but will never go out of style. “The stove (especially when oversized and custom) is often the focal point of the kitchen, and statement hoods are becoming the accent,” says interior designer, luxury stager, and CEO of Staged to Sell Home, Jason Saft. “Consider them like jewelry for your kitchen.”\nAnd these practical pieces don’t just look nice—if you regularly like to chef it up, a stove hood is a necessity for removing airborne grease, fumes, smoke, and heat, so you won’t experience a major oopsie while cooking or entertaining. (It’s a wee bit embarrassing accidentally setting off the fire alarm while searing a steak, no?)\nTo add depth and warmth to your kitchen, Saft recommends a metallic hood, like brass or copper, but you can really go with any color that makes your heart smile. “If you have the opportunity to do something that stands out, go for it, just make sure other elements in the kitchen are toned down so they don’t compete,” adds Saft. Charleston-based interior designer Allison Park Blake recommends using a website like Hoodsley to customize every aspect of your new centerpiece—you’ll be able to choose the width, shape, finish, and more—without breaking the bank.\nDedicated Coffee Stations\na white shelf with objects on it\nLast year, designers saw a boom in designated coffee alcoves, and according to Saft, this trend is only gaining steam(ed milk, lol). “People must be tired of driving to Starbucks, because I’m seeing so many built-in coffee stations that feature professional-grade espresso machines and multiple ways to brew a fresh cup,” he says.\nConsidering TikTok has put an emphasis on crafting a calming morning routine, bringing the cozy café vibes home makes sense—I mean, who wants to wait in ridiculous coffee shop lines when you can brew a better cup from the comfort of your casa? And think about all the money you’ll save by becoming your own barista!\n“You don’t need to have custom millwork or expensive machines to designate an area of your kitchen for your cup of joe,” promises Saft. “Just map out a little nook and break out some of your fanciest dishes for sugar and other coffee accessories.” And if you’re short on space, think about converting your bar cart into a coffee bar cart—that’s exactly what I’ve been doing as I explore a sober-curious lifestyle. Instead of booze, my bar cart is now home to my trusty espresso machine and gorgeous mugs. Plus, I love displaying my favorite craft coffee bags like they’re little works of art.\nColorful Cabinetry\na kitchen with blue cabinets\nSomeone failed to give Kim K the memo that boring, all-beige kitchens are out and incorporating color is in (sorry Kim, love you). After all, kitchens aren’t meant to feel stark and sterile like a hospital. If the 2024 trends are teaching us anything, it’s that your culinary space should be the most welcoming area of your house, so take this as your sign to break out the paint.\nAccording to Havenly lead interior designer and design director Heather Goerzen, neutral cabinets and all-white kitchens are fading out of style. (Honestly, bless.) “Bold and moody cabinetry in shades like dark green, dark blue, ochre, and warm walnut are taking white’s place, adding saturation and personality to cook spaces,” she says.\nNow, we’re not suggesting choosing a hot pink shade (although if that’s your vibe, we’re all for embracing your Barbie-core dreams). But if you’re not ready to fully commit to colorful cabinets, Blake mentions that having a mix of stained and painted finishes can also add warmth to the space. “The contrast of finishes will really make things pop.”\nCustom Cabinets for Optimized Storage\na kitchen with white cabinets\nRegardless of how often I try to organize, I end up dealing with a Tupperware avalanche at least once a week. And after talking with my friends, this seems to be a seriously common issue. Luckily, there’s a simple solution that designers are obsessed with and encouraging all of their clients to consider: customized cabinets that fit every last item.\n“In the ’50s, cupboards and fridges had way more bells and whistles than they do today. As the decades unfolded, however, the story became about cramming as much cabinetry into the kitchen as you could. 2024 is a return to storage that not only works, but is custom to you,” says Yokota.\nBeyond Tupperware, isn’t it so frustrating when your delicately blown Italian coup glasses or even your beloved Stanley cups are just a tad bit too tall to fit on the shelf? (Sidenote: Why are Stanley cups too big for every cabinet?!) Yokota says that creating specific zones that flawlessly fit your unique drinkware collection (and other types of items, of course) can be a minor addition that makes a world of a difference.\nIf you can’t completely customize your cabinets, purchasing mini organizers—like a wine glass or pot lid holder—can make you feel like an organization queen. And the peace of mind you’ll experience knowing that everything has a spot is absolutely priceless.\nVintage Touches\na kitchen with a chandelier\nGet in ladies, we’re going thrifting…but instead of seeking out the perfect pair of lived-in jeans, we’re looking for hand-me-down items that will make your kitchen feel oh-so homey. “Mixing antique materials—like vintage countertop lamps, brass hardware, and retro-looking fixtures—with modern kitchen finishes can give the space a warm and inviting feel,” says Blake.\nHomeGoods Style Expert Ursula Carmona urges you to think outside of the box by picking unique decor pieces you’d normally use in a bedroom or living room. “Look for ceramic table lamps and glass décor accents to set the tone of space, and then pick up things like marble decorative boxes to store knick-knacks, velvet picture frames to hide outlets, and small metal catch-all trays to hold your oil and vinegar assortment.”\nYokota also loves the idea of adding antique light fixtures to “maximize style.” And I say go big or go home: If you find an eye-catching brass or gold chandelier that looks like it belongs in Jay Gatsby’s mansion, you probably need it for your kitchen.\nMultipurpose Kitchen Islands\na kitchen with white cabinets\nYou may have the comfiest couch of all your friends and family, but people aren’t hanging out in the living room this year! Yokota predicts that all of the magic is going to happen around the kitchen island. “In 2024, we’re seeing far more of what I call ‘connection islands,'” she explains. “This approach takes the island from a space where we cook to a space where we connect with our family.”\nBecause the island is the new go-to place for gathering, you’ll want major appliances as well as little luxuries to be focused in this area. Yokota suggests placing your sink on the island, so you can face and interact with your guests while cooking and cleaning; adding comfortable seating (those plush velvet bar stools you’ve been eyeing will be perfect!); and maybe even including a mini pull-out fridge for easy drink grabbing. “When we put connection at the heart of this room, we deepen the way we feel about our homes,” adds Yokota. Love that for us!\nAll Wood Everything\na vase with flowers on a counter\nLove an all-natural look? Try adding woody touches to your cuisine (that’s kitchen in French, duh). “People want their kitchen to feel like a hub that everyone wants to spend time in. Knowing that wood pieces can evoke such a feeling of centrality and comfort, I think everyone will continue to be more and more drawn to this design trend,” shares Carmona. “Wood accents instantly warm up a space and make the room feel more inviting,” she adds, which is a great contrast to the normally somewhat chaotic kitchen energy.\nThis is probs one of the easiest trends to incorporate, because no renovations are required! No need to chop wood (unless you wanna)—just pick up little accents and incorporate them in your space, whether they be cutting boards, vases, or bar stools.",

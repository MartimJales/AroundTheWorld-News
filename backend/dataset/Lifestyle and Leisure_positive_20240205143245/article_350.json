The event, which closed on Dec. 24, drew about 240,000 visitors during its run, organizers said. (H. Rick Bamman/For the Beacon-News) About 240,000 people visited Christkindlmarket at RiverEdge Park in Aurora during the holiday season, a big increase over the numbers in 2022, according to attendance figures released by event organizers Friday. Overall, the Christkindlmarkets in downtown Chicago, the Wrigleyville area of Chicago and Aurora saw more than two million visitors over the three locations during the holidays, according to a press release. Advertisement The 2023 Christkindlmarkets were organized by German American Events, LLC. The group said the numbers released Friday represent “an unprecedented surge in attendance.” The attendance included an increase of almost 100,000 people at the Aurora location in RiverEdge Park downtown, from about 150,000 in 2022 to 240,000 in 2023. Advertisement The flagship location in Daley Plaza in downtown Chicago saw some 1.3 million visitors, according to German American Events. The Wrigleyville location, part of the Wintrust Hinterland at Gallagher Way, saw 480,000 visitors. Christkindlmarket Chicago and Aurora ran between Nov. 17 and Dec. 24, and the Wrigleyville location ran through Dec. 31. “What a wonderful season,” said Maren Biester Priebe, CEO and general manager of German American Events. “We are immensely grateful to each and every visitor and hope that their time with us was filled with magical moments that created cherished memories.” The organization cited several milestones and highlights that contributed to the success of the markets, including the introduction of the first-ever German and Austrian wine-tasting event, glassblowing demonstrations, interactive photo opportunities, location-specific mugs and more. The Aurora market was expanded this year from 39 vendors to 53. The festival also utilized expanded lights and decorations. The Aurora location will start up again in November 2024, the third year of a three-year contract between the city and German American Events. Advertisement",

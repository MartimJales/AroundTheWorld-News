Target‚Äôs Embark Tumbler is ONLY $14.99 & Already Getting Fantastic Reviews!\nHip2Save may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you via trusted partners and affiliate links in this post. Prices and availability are accurate as of time posted.\nRead our full disclosure policy here. Target‚Äôs new tumbler will have you filling your cup without draining your bank account!\nIf the $45+ price tag of a Stanley Tumbler is a pill you just can‚Äôt swallow, head to\nTarget for this affordable lookalike! The Embark 40oz Straw Tumbler boasts a lot of similar qualities all for just $14.99! Plus, how pretty are they?! üòç\nThe BEST part is that you can skip the feeding frenzy at the next Stanley release and order these online with all five available color options currently in stock for shipping!\nAnd don‚Äôt forget to use your\nTarget RedCard for an extra 5% off and free shipping! Embark 40oz Straw Tumbler\nOnly $14.99!\nWhile the look is very similar to the Stanley Adventure Quencher Tumbler, this cup also comes with a wide plastic straw and features a sippable lid with a straw hole. The familiar side handle makes it easy to carry and hold, while the narrowed bottom will fit in most cupholders. It looks quite sleek and it can keep your beverages cold for up to 20 hours. Plus it‚Äôs dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning.\nThis cup is currently available in black, cream, forest green, light blue, and orange. You may be able to have it sooner if you order online for store pickup, but the color selection does appear to be better online for shipping.\nThese could start to sell out quickly once the word is out, so I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to place an order if this budget-friendly tumbler has piqued your interest! You may even want to consider grabbing them for Valentine‚Äôs gifts!\nMany reviewers feel this cup rivals the popular Stanley Tumblers too‚Ä¶\nMuch cheaper alternative to Stanley Tumblers with the same high quality.\nBought this as a gift for my grandson, personalized it and he loved it. It is the right size for him. It is identical to the Stanley brand and much more reasonable in price. Would buy again.\nI like how it does the job and keeps the drink cold. I would never pay for a Stanley and this is exactly the same thing. So happy I came across this tumbler in the store today. You won‚Äôt regret it!\n-\n[Shipping & Terms](#)\nTarget\nShipping is free on orders of $35 or more. You may also be able to opt for free in-store pickup if items are in stock and available near you.\nIf you're a\nTarget RedCard holder, you'll get an additional 5% off your order plus free shipping on any size order! However, exclusions do apply and orders for RedCard holders may require the $35+ shipping threshold.\nPlus, you might be able to score $1 savings on your order by consolidating your shipping. On the app, just click the No-Rush Shipping option. Online, click the \"Save $1 with Order Consolidation\" option during checkout.",

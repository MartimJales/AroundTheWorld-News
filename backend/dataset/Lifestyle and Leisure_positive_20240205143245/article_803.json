    "text": "Hello cat lovers and cat enthusiasts, The weekend is here and we're [heading way into January](https://cheezburger.com/18904837/20-dry-january-memes-tweets-and-fails-for-folks-who-couldnt-make-it-past-the-first-week), a month of cold and cozy, but never fear. As hoomans, we have developed clothing to protect our flesh and bones from the cold of the outside air. [For those of you who live in snow](https://cheezburger.com/23348485/40-wonderfully-wholesome-animals-walking-in-a-winter-wonderland-for-a-pawsitively-heartwarming) this is even more essential. We need buddles, layers, and coats to keep warm, not to mention our insulated, heating homes. For our domesticated felines they get the same treatment as us…fire burning in the fireplace with an icy view out our window. And where are all the strays during a season like this? We'll tell you. They're outside playing in the snow, [making snow angels](https://cheezburger.com/9850395648/snow-angels), and avoiding the yellow snow. Cats are happy to be inside or out, they use the snow to their advantage. Lucky for them they have a fur coat. So let's celebrate these adorably playful kitties having their romp in the hay (or snow). [Sign up for our newsletter for a daily dose of hissterical cats and feel-good felines!](https://icanhascheezburger.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=web&utm_medium=intro&utm_campaign=marielintro) Did this cat just pop up from being underground? Looks like he just escaped a snow hole and doesn't know what planet he's on. Confused and bewildered as he may be, we know he's going to have tons of fun in the fluffy white snow. What a beautiful white fur coat to match the beautiful white snow…but wait, why's his face so distressed? This crazy looking cat must be having the time of his life in this Winter Wonderland, kudos to him.

    "text": "THE Ultimate wing-off\n'I Compared The New Wings At Popeyes To Wingstop. I Couldn't Believe Who Won — And By A Near-Landslide'\nWingstop is the King of Wings in the fast-food world. The chain, which has more than 1,800 locations in the US, is unstoppable.\nSo, when\nPopeyes expanded its permanent menu to include chicken wings in late November, it seemed fitting to see how they stacked up to the No. 1 player in the category.\nBusiness Insider's correspondent, Nancy Luna, compared\nWingstop to Popeyes and was stunned by the results.\n[We compared four flavors at Wingstop to similar flavors at Popeyes. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nWingstop sells 12 flavors of wings. Popeyes offers five flavors. The Popeyes vs. Wingstop matchups went as follows:\n-\nRoasted Garlic Parmesan vs. Garlic Parmesan.\n-\nHoney BBQ vs. Hickory Smoked BBQ.\n-\nGhost Pepper vs. Louisiana Rub.\n-\nSweet 'N Spicy vs. Spicy Korean Q.\n[Wingstop prices are a tad higher per wing than Popeyes. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nWingstop's prices per wing are a tad higher than Popeyes.\nAt Popeyes, six a la carte wings are $6.99, or roughly $1.17 per wing. At Wingstop, the smallest a la carte box is 10 pieces for $12.99. That's about $1.30 per wing.\nBoth chains took about 20 minutes to prepare my order.\n[Roasted Garlic wings at Popeyes show red flakes, indicating I might feel some heat. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nThe Roasted Garlic Parmesan wings at Popeyes were crazy delicious. The asiago cheese mixed into the sauce gave the wings a nice smoky flavor.\nThe cheesy garlic sauce was soaked in the deep-fried coating of the wing, making for a delicious crunchy bite. There's a bit of unexpected heat that comes with these wings, as well.\n[The Garlic Parmesan wings at Wingstop were heavily dusted in cheese. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nLuna thought the\nGarlic Parmesan wings at Wingstop would be superior to Popeyes because it's such a classic flavor.\nBut the wings were a total letdown, from presentation to taste. The wings are also noticeably smaller than Popeyes.\n[The Sweet 'N Spicy wings are swimming in chili oil. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nPopeyes said the Sweet 'N Spicy wings, tested earlier this year, are the chain's \"best performing product since the infamous Chicken Sandwich.\"\nThe wings are bathed in a pool of chili oil. It was sticky tangy goodness in one bite. It was like eating orange chicken but with a lot more heat.\n[Wingstop's Spicy Korean wings were similar in flavor to the Sweet 'N Spicy wings at Popeyes. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nThe Spicy Korean Q wings at Wingstop have a similar flavor and heat profile to the Sweet 'N Spicy wings.\nThe Spicy Korean Q wings are described on Wingstop's menu as a \"sweet and spicy\" wing made with ginger, garlic, sriracha, and crushed red pepper. It was nearly identical in taste to Popeyes' Sweet 'N Spicy wings.\n[Wingstop's Louisiana Rub wings were the best of the four we tasted. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nThe Louisiana Rub wings at Wingstop were lightly coated in a Cajun seasoning. They were the best wings Luna tried at Wingstop.\nThe Louisiana Rub wings had the perfect amount of heat. The seasoning on the breading also wasn't an afterthought like the Parmesan crumbles on the garlic wings.",

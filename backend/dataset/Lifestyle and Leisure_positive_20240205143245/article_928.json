    "text": "It’s unbelievable how one simple change can dramatically improve your performance. A big part of being able to pass your medical is taking care of yourself and making sure you’re only putting the best quality nutrition into your body. That’s why we recommend Claroxan Advanced for healthy eyesight.* It’s more than just a regular eye supplement. In addition to lutein and zeaxanthin for macular pigment and blue light filtration – it also contains bilberry extract for night vision support, grape seed extract for antioxidant and circulation support, and riboflavin and other vitamins that help contribute to the maintenance of normal, healthy vision.* Claroxan Advanced is a once daily tablet that is easy to swallow and easy on the gut and provides your eyes with the nutrition they need to help you continue doing what you love to do for as long as possible.* Claroxan Advanced is distributed by Pacific Health, Inc. All of their products are rooted in innovation and provide superior value and consistent, high-quality. The Claroxan brand was launched in 2003 and has been trusted and preferred in the aviation community since 2005 and if you’re not 100% satisfied, they have a 100% money-back guarantee on all unopened bottles. Seriously, it’s one of the best eye supplements out there.

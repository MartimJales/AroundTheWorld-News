    "text": "Detroit Red Wings prospect Trey Augustine backstops U.S. to World Juniors gold medal Helene St. James Detroit Free Press View Comments Two prospects who project to play key roles for the Detroit Red Wings left the World Junior Championship with remarkable performances.\nTrey Augustine backstopped the U.S. team to a 6-2 victory that clinched gold in Gothenburg, Sweden, leaving the Swedes to console themselves with silver. Swedish defenseman Axel Sandin Pellikka had an assist to give him six points in seven games.\nAugustine, who turns 19 in February, made 24 saves Friday.\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Augustine told local reporters. \"We just stuck to our game plan, and things worked out for us. I think the turning point was early in the third when we got that goal from Buium. That settled us down. It was a great game for us. We wanted to make them make a perfect shot.\"\nSince being drafted by the Wings last summer, he has had a standout start to his freshman year at Michigan State, posting a 2.97 goals-against average and .916 save percentage in 17 games as the Spartans have established themselves in the top 10 in the polls.\nFriday's finale had the U.S. holding a 3-2 lead headed into the third period. Sandin Pellikka set up Jonathan Lekkerimaki's goal with five seconds to play in the second period. That was Sandin Pellikka's fourth assist in the prestigious tournament.\nSandin Pellikka is, essentially, who the Wings got in the trade that sent Filip Hronek to the Vancouver Canucks at last year's trade deadline. (Hronek is having a phenomenal season: He has 29 points in 38 games, and a plus-21 rating.) The Wings received a first-round pick from the Canucks, which, at No. 17, they used on Sandin Pellikka.\nSandin Pellikka, who turns 19 in March, has 13 points in 25 games with Skelleftea in the Swedish Hockey League, already topping the five points he had in 22 games in his draft year.\nJUST DRIVE: Red Wings' Axel Sandin Pellikka's incredible road trip to the 2023 NHL draft\nAugustine also dates from the 2023 draft, selected in the second round at No. 41 overall. The South Lyon product is an alumnus of USA Hockey's National Team Development Program. He posted a 2.14 goals-against average and .925 save percentage in 32 games in his draft year.\nDefenseman Anton Johansson, a fourth-round pick from 2022, was also in Sweden's lineup. Forward Nate Danielson, the Wings' top pick, at No. 9, last summer, was part of the Canadian team that got knocked out by Czechia in the quarterfinals. Danielson's five-game tournament (one goal, two assists) was highlighted by a net-front goal he scored against Finland.\nView Comments",

    "text": "There's nothing holdin' Shawn Mendes back – not even a winter coat. On Sunday, following the storm that blanketed much of the Northeast in snow, the 25-year-old Canadian singer took to social media to share videos of himself frolicking in the winter wonderland. In one clip posted on X and Instagram, Mendes can be seen running outside wearing nothing but shorts and lying down in the snow. \"This is cold, bro,\" he says. In another video, he sleds down a small hill while shirtless and barefoot. \"you can take the boy outta Canada,\" Mendes joked in the caption. \"What my mum thinks i do before i get a flu,\" one fan commented on Instagram. \"I hope he doesn't get sick,\" someone else added on X. Eventually, Mendes warmed up by the fire, played some guitar, and went snowshoeing – with clothes on.

I found that in moments of extreme anxiety or fear if i sat down with my harmonium and allowed myself with full trust to sing whatever came out it would often ease the pain,\" he wrote. \"it felt so difficult at first to let myself sing without needing perfection but after a while i actually started to fall in love with the dance between the 'right' and the 'wrong' notes.\" \"The biggest lesson for me this year has been to accept and welcome the lows of life… not to constantly need to change or fix something in order to feel high again, because i know if i really slow down and listen when i’m low there’s always something to hear.\" [privacy policy](/info/privacy-policy)and [terms of use](/info/terms-of-use). - Judd Apatow Says It’s ‘Insulting’ That Oscars Put ‘Barbie’ in Adapted Screenplay CategoryEntertainment - Emma Kenney on ‘Shameless’ Co-Star Jeremy Allen White: ‘He Is Getting the Attention He Deserves’ (Exclusive)Entertainment - Rock ‘n’ Roll Legend Admits He Is ‘Intimidated’ by Young Musicians Shredding on InstagramEntertainment - Jelly Roll Visits His Former Jail Cell, Breaks Down in Tears: WatchEntertainment - Taraji P.

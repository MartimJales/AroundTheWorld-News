    "text": "Farmers from Legazpi City in Albay proudly show the fruits of their labor during the Harvest Festival. The SM Foundation continues to work towards achieving its vision of a future where farmers are empowered, able to share knowledge with the community, and collectively work towards elevating the entire industry through agriculture.\nAs a testament to this, several farmers from Pampanga, Tarlac, Camarines Sur, and Albay completed SM Foundation’s Kabalikat sa Kabuhayan (KSK) on Sustainable Agriculture Program.\nThrough KSK program farmers first underwent hands-on lectures, spanning from modern farming methods to marketing and business principles to arm them with updated agricultural knowledge and skills. Capping weeks of learning sessions, the farmers held harvest festivals in their demo farms and joined market tours with SM Markets to explore selling opportunities.\nSince 2007, the program has benefited over 28,000 marginalized farmers with some graduates becoming seasonal suppliers for the SM group and local markets.\nSM Foundation’s KSK-SAP is conducted in partnership with SM Supermalls, SM Markets, TESDA, DA, DSWD, DOST, DTI, and partner farm schools.",

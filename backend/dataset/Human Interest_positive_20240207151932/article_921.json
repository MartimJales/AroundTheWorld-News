    "text": "From swimming to skiing, people of all ages enjoy the snowstorm in Burlington After weeks without snow, storm brings joy to many in our region. After weeks without snow, storm brings joy to many in our region. After weeks without snow, storm brings joy to many in our region. Whether you like to spend the day on the couch or out on the mountain, many in our region have been waiting a long time for a good snowstorm. Sunday's storm didn't slow down the fun for anyone at Oakledge Park in Burlington. A group of friends kept up their weekly get-together, taking a dip in Lake Champlain. Jesse Ritvo said the snow is \"perfect\" for the lake. They said there are a lot of benefits for your body by exposing it to the cold for a couple of minutes each week. \"As soon as as soon as we're in, we're going to have more dopamine and norepinephrine lasting for 4 to 6 hours,\" said Ritvo. \"So with the dopamine, things that are pleasurable are going to be more so. And, with the combination of dopamine and norepinephrine, we're going to have better focus.\" However, Ritvo, first responders, and other health experts agree that you should always be careful when swimming in cold water. \"I feel amazing but check with your physician or your PCP before you do this,\" said Ritvo. Back on land, the park looked a lot more like what can typically come to mind when you think of a 'snowstorm'. People of all ages got outside for some snowy fun in what some call the best kind of snow. \"It's part powder, part sticky,\" said 5th grade student Bellamy Hill. \"It's like fluffy; if you squish it, it'll stick.\" From cross-country skiing to walking the dog, the latest big storm of the season finally brought winter back to the Green Mountain State. \"We were really sad when on Christmas and on Hannukah that there wasn't any snow and on winter break there wasn't snow,\" said Colby Hill, Bellamy's brother. \"Then a couple days after, there was still no snow -- and now we have this and we're happy.\" The Hills said they're hoping the snow will stick around long enough to cause a school delay in the morning.",

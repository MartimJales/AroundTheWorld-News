    "text": "The [Thriving Threads](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100076333279967) clothing room in Perry Village was a busy place in 2023. This nonprofit organization last year served more than 6,000 people, and gave away over 40,000 pieces of clothing. Those statistics were provided by Thriving Threads Lead Manager Samantha Ferrell. Thriving Threads offers a wide variety of free, gently used clothing for men, women and children of all ages and sizes. The clothing room is open to residents from all communities, and not just the Perry area. Although there are no income requirements to shop at Thriving Threads, Ferrell believes that tough economic conditions prompted a lot of shoppers to obtain clothing at the organization in 2023. “They might as well visit us (for free clothing) and be able to take that money and put it towards food at the grocery store,” she said. In addition, Thriving Threads has been getting visits from more grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. “We’re seeing a big rise in that,” said Ferrell, who’s served as the clothing room’s nonpaid leader for three years. Thriving Threads also provides used pants and cleats for children who are playing in youth baseball and football leagues; and formal wear for teenage boys and girls during prom season. Every year prior to Halloween, Thriving Threads strives to stock a good selection of costumes for boys and girls. “So I think all of those things have helped a lot of people,” Ferrell said. Thriving Threads is located in the back of the western side of the Manchester West building at 4261 Manchester Road. The clothing room is situated alongside the [Perry Center of Lake County,](http://www.facebook.com/PerryCenterofLakeCounty) a local food pantry and Salvation Army Unit that provides charitable services within the Perry community. Ferrell receives assistance from three adult volunteers to sort clothing, put the apparel on display and rotate some of the inventory to feature seasonal items. “The volunteers have been great,” she said. “They’ve been coming in off hours to help, just trying to keep up.” Thriving Threads also obtains help during the school year from students in [Perry High School’s](http://www.perry-lake.org/phs) Perry Service Learning class. The [PSL](http://perryservicelearning.weebly.com) students who volunteer at Thriving Threads spearhead activities such as collection drives for prom apparel and clothing for cold-weather months. PSL is an elective for seniors at the high school that combines English and social studies with volunteer opportunities to promote social involvement through education and service. Thriving Threads’ regular hours for shopping are 9 a.m. to noon Tuesday and 1 to 4 p.m. Friday. However, shoppers with different schedules are welcome to contact Ferrell to arrange other times to visit. Samantha Ferrell can be reached by email at thrivingthreadsinperry@gmail.com; by calling the Perry Center of Lake County at 440-259-3322; or by leaving her a message on the [Thriving Threads Facebook page.](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100076333279967) People can contribute used clothing that’s in good condition during regular shopping hours. The organization also has a wooden bin near its entrance for after-hours donations. Ferrell said the community has been extremely generous in donating apparel for the clothing room. Thriving Threads uses its [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100076333279967) to post pictures and notices highlighting clothing that is available during the different seasons. Sometimes, the Facebook page also issues announcements about Thriving Threads having an urgent need for donations of certain clothing. Thriving Threads was established in 1999 by the Perry Women’s League, [according to an entry](http://perryservicelearning.weebly.com/thriving-threads.html) on the [Perry Service Learning program website.](http://perryservicelearning.weebly.com) Ferrell said that helping to direct the operations at Thriving Threads has been a fulfilling experience. “It’s rewarding every day, seeing people being so grateful just for free clothing, or being able to clothe their kids because they’re growing so quick,” she said.",

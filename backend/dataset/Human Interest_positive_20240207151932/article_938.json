I was looking at Ollie... and thinking...where is his mum... all his dad sorry to say Jules lol,\" wrote another.\nWhile her followers may be divided on who Ollie looks like, one thing is for sure, they are a gorgeous little family!\nOllie is growing up fast and recently hit another big milestone!\nJules posted an adorable video of Ollie on her\nBaby Cub account as he played with a calendar at home and turns out he's learnt a new word.\n\"Ok mama and dada is there. But first OFFICIAL word is PUPPY!

You know you want one! He'd be happy with the pictures for a while!\" commented one follower.\nAnother wrote, \"Aww bless. I mean, you can't not get a puppy now.\"\nJules, Cam and Ollie recently returned from a luxurious family trip to Fiji ‚Äî which was also the finale of her festival of 40 celebrations.\nWhile it was a fabulous holiday, these snaps from Jules look like it's well and truly back to reality now.\n\"Was feeling the holiday glow, then someone had a little accident and became bilingual. P.S he is fine now,\"\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CcsAcRFrtLK/.\nIn one image Ollie is flashing a cheeky grin to the camera while they snap a selfie. But she also posted a video, showing the stitches on his head covered by a bandage. Ollie is talking absolute gibberish, but clearly very happy about it.\n\"Awww this is the cutest thing I've seen in a while!\" commented one follower.\nAnother suggested that Ollie was just trying to speak Irish.\nBut Ollie's little bump on the head doesn't seem to be bothering him and they also enjoyed a family day out at The Wiggles concert.\n\"Fruit Salad Class of '22'üçèüçâüçìüçåPlenty of fun, so involved & loved it‚Ä¶ Ollie did too‚Ä¶üòÇ Thanks for putting on a show @thewiggles Currently still humming in my head,\"\nCam captioned a series of posts from the day.\nJudging by these snaps, Cam and Jules may have had more fun than Ollie too.",

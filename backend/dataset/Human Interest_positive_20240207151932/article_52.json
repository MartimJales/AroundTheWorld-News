    "text": "Despite a slowdown in other parts of the country, the real estate market in the Dallas region remained strong through the end of 2023 and into the new year, with Allie Beth Allman & Associates agents posting several significant sales.

Note that in many cases, the boutique luxury brokerage also brought the buyer, a testament to the agents’ strong networks that help get homes sold quickly and smoothly.\nAdvertisement Just before Thanksgiving, Brittany Mathews showed the neoclassical residence at 3607 Euclid Ave. to Alex Perry and his buyer client, who loved it. Located in Highland Park, the four-bedroom home has a stately design with two-story columns highlighting the brick exterior.\nGet updates from Abode Sign up for the Abode newsletter for a weekly roundup of the latest home, design and real estate stories.\nSIGN UP Or with:",

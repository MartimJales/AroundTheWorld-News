    "text": "An emotional Matthew Slater made it clear he is appreciative of the support shown by New England Patriots fans. There’s a strong possibility the 38-year-old Slater, who concluded his 16th season with the organization, could retire this offseason. Slater contemplated retirement last offseason, but returned for New England’s disappointing 2023 campaign. Immediately after the [Patriots’ Week 18 loss](https://nesn.com/2024/01/six-thoughts-on-patriots-snowy-week-18-loss-to-jets/) to the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium, Slater [posted as video](https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/1744108930295386303) on the team’s account. “Just want to say thank you guys for everything,” Slater said, per the team. “Sorry this season didn’t go the way we wanted to. But I got a lot of faith in this team moving forward. God bless you guys, and as always, go Pats.” Story continues below advertisement Slater expanded on his appreciation while speaking with reporters after the game. [Leave a comment.](javascript:void(0)) “Message to the fans is just thank you,” Slater told reporters, per the team. “I came here, I had no expectations. I didn’t think I was going to be here very long. I was just a special teams player. I’m not the quarterback, I’m not catching balls, I’m not sacking the quarterback. So to be embraced by the fans in the community the way my family and I have, it means a lot. “I thank them for that, I thank them for their endless support for our team. I thank them for challenging our team, spurring us on. But to be embraced by this community and this fanbase has meant a great deal to myself and my family. So, thank you.” Story continues below advertisement Patriots fans weren’t the only ones to shower Slater in praise. His New England teammates honored Slater with [their pregame sweatshirts](https://nesn.com/2024/01/how-patriots-honored-matthew-slater-before-likely-final-game/) while [past teammates took to social media](https://nesn.com/2024/01/tom-brady-patriots-legends-salute-matthew-slater-prior-to-possible-sendoff/) to give Slater a shoutout. Slater’s family also was in attendance and videos captured an emotional scene pregame. Slater would not confirm if it was his final season when asked again Sunday. The Patriots concluded the season 4-13 and are [locked into a top-three pick](https://nesn.com/2024/01/patriots-clinch-top-three-pick-2024-nfl-draft-loss-to-jets/) in the 2024 NFL Draft.

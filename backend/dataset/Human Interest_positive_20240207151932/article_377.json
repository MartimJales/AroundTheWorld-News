    "text": "07 January 2024, 23:05\nIngush authorities report reconciliation of feudist families\nAfter requests from theologians and authorities, six families in Ingushetia abandoned their declared blood feud.\nThe\n[\"Caucasian Knot\"](/) has reported that on December 3, 2023, Chechen authorities reported that a reconciliation ceremony of two families from Ingushetia and Chechnya took place in Grozny; one of the families had declared blood feud to the due to the perished relative.\nIn Ingushetia, dozens of families, \"meeting the requests made by theologians and authorities,\" decided to abandon their mutual hostility and conflicts, the head of the republic, Makhmud-Ali Kalimatov, has stated in his Telegram channel.\nHe treated the achieved results as \"good.\" \"Nevertheless, I find it necessary to intensify the work of the conciliation commission. It is necessary to more often inform republic's residents, especially young people, about the need to observe traffic rules, and to be restrained in actions that can lead to conflicts, sometimes with tragic consequences,\" says the channel.\nIn North Ossetia, the idea was voiced out that blood feud as a consequence of murder had kept people from violence, the author of the blog \"Female Blogger. North Caucasus\" that she runs on the\n[\"Caucasian Knot\"](/) has pointed out.\nBack in February 2022, analysts pointed out that in North Ossetia, murders due to blood feud are rare; almost all conflicts are settled down within the legal framework.\nLet us remind you that in Chechnya, neighbouring on Ingushetia, authorities\n[are regularly reporting on reconciliation of feudist families](/articles/62202). Reconciliation [often occurs under authorities' pressure](/articles/62949), although in such cases hostility may actually continue, Ruslan Kutaev, the President of the Assembly of Caucasian Nations, has noted.\nIn 2010, Chechen authorities set up a commission for national reconciliation. However, despite the declared fight against the blood feud custom, in 2019, Magomed Daudov, the Speaker of the Chechen Parliament,\n[declared blood feud to blogger, Tumso Abdurakhmanov](/articles/46455), for his words about Akhmat Kadyrov.\nThis article was originally published on the Russian page of 24/7 Internet agency ‘Caucasian Knot’ on January 6, 2024 at 04:24 pm MSK.

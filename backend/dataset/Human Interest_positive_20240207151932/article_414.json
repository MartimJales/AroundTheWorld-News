    "text": "Perfectly chilled: Beresford Estate serves up Picnic & Sip [ Sponsored ](https://indaily.com.au/news/sponsored-content/) No need to pack a picnic basket or search for an idyllic setting, because Beresford Estate has everything sorted during their Picnic & Sip sessions over summer. “Just bring yourself” is the invitation everyone wants to hear, promising maximum relaxation in return for minimal effort. Happily, the new Picnic & Sip sessions at beautiful Beresford Estate promise just that. These Sunday sessions on the manicured lawns of the winery and 70-acre vineyard are an opportunity to do nothing but take in the breathtaking views and unwind with friends while listening to suitably laidback live music. Booking ahead means there will be a gourmet picnic basket for two waiting, with cheese, antipasto and a bottle of Beresford Classic wine. As well, there will be handcrafted libations and drink specials from the 23rd Street Distillery can bar, plus wines available by the bottle and glass. One to try is the new [2023 Emblem Fiano,](https://indaily.com.au/news/sponsored-content/2023/11/09/uncorking-2000-years-beresford-wines-relatively-new-white) a lighter, juicy style of the varietal, with vibrant notes of apple and citrus. Worth adding to the experience is an overnight stay in one of the 15 luxury suites, the winners of the Accommodation award in the 2023 Best of Wine Tourism Awards. Opened only a year ago, the well-appointed and beautifully-decorated suites offer privacy and spectacular views, with each of the five Grand Reserve suites also having a private plunge pool. If stretching out on the lawns during Picnic & Sip is likely to take some physical effort, a soothing in-room massage can be pre-booked to limber up tight limbs. Beresford Estate’s Picnic & Sip sessions are on every second and fourth Sunday of the month until the end of March.

    "text": "[Ibrahima Konate](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/ibrahima-konate/index.html) said [Liverpool](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html) were enjoying the challenge of chasing four trophies after his impressive display in the FA Cup victory over [Arsenal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html). Liverpool continue to battle on four fronts after Jakub Kiwior's own goal and a stoppage-time strike by [Luis Diaz](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/luis-diaz/index.html) sent them through to the FA Cup fourth round with a 2-0 win at Arsenal. [Jurgen Klopp](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/jurgen_klopp/index.html)'s side were without captain [Virgil van Dijk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/virgil-van-dijk/index.html) and Mohamad Salah, but after they were able to ride their luck in north London, stand-in skipper [Trent Alexander-Arnold](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/trent-alexander-arnold/index.html)'s excellent late cross forced the opener and Diaz was able to wrap up a hard-fought victory with a powerful late finish.",

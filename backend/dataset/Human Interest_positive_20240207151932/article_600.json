    "text": "Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Bruce Pascoe Once Pelle Larsson picked up his phone after playing Thursday night, the secret was out.\n‚ÄúMy mom texted me right after the game, so she made me aware of it,‚Äù Larsson said.\nFrida Larsson told her son he needed only seven points to become a 1,000-point scorer in college, which Pelle became during No. 10-ranked Arizona‚Äôs 92-73 win over Utah on Saturday night.\nLarsson\nA similar scenario was only slightly less obvious to UA center Oumar Ballo, who needed 17 entering Saturday‚Äôs game to reach 1,000. He said he was told in the second half that he was only four points away when Larsson hit the mark with 12:28 left.\nBallo‚Äôs teammates knew it, too. In fact, sophomore Kylan Boswell, who spent the weekend dishing eye-opening assists to Keshad Johnson (a 15-foot no-look bullet against Utah) and Larsson (a 70-foot, double-bounce spiral against Colorado), maybe pushed his luck trying to make it happen.\nPeople are also reading‚Ä¶ New video posted of a jaguar in Southern Arizona Tucson's beloved Roadhouse Cinemas is expanding in a big way 4-mile stretch of I-10 in Tucson to get $171M makeover Viral video of car-top coyote in Tucson racks up 10 million views Video shows new jaguar in Arizona, experts confirm 23 Tucson restaurants that closed their doors in 2023 Off the Vine Arizona Wine Festival is moving to a new spot in Tucson 10 new restaurants and cafes expected to open in Tucson in 2024 Colder Tucson temps coming, along with a chance of snow 80 fun events happening in Tucson this January 2024 üé™üéº New details announced on U of A hiring and pay freezes Tucson asks self-driving truck firm to return $110K in incentive money New storm system to bring cold, wind to Tucson 5 indoor pickleball venues are planned for the Tucson area 23 local restaurants that closed their doors this year üò• With Ballo sitting on 998 for his career entering the final six minutes Saturday, when UA led Utah 77-64, Boswell tried to hit him on the run but threw it too far for a turnover.\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize he was trying to get O his thousandth point,‚Äù UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it because it was five-something minutes to go, and (it was) `Let‚Äôs run a little clock, unless we have something easy.‚Äô ‚Äù\nSo it was Caleb Love, instead, who hit Ballo with an assist less than two minutes later, and nobody, as it turned out, may have been happier to see it than Lloyd.\nBallo\nLloyd noted with a smile after the game that he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmilestone guy‚Äù but spoke to the significance of Ballo‚Äôs achievement, having worked for two years with the Malian big man as a project at Gonzaga ‚Äî and watching him bloom into an all-conference player last season.\nBallo sat out an academic redshirt season in 2019-20 at Gonzaga and then remained behind standout big man Drew Timme and eventually then-freshman Ben Gregg in 2020-21, scoring only 60 points as a redshirt freshman that season.\nThen Ballo followed Lloyd to Arizona before the 2021-22 season and has scored 940 points since.\n‚ÄúHe was obviously going through some tough times,‚Äù Lloyd said. ‚ÄúHe and I were together, and for him to be able to flip it like this ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think anybody three years ago would have said Oumar Ballo would score 1,000 points.\n‚ÄúYou know, it ain‚Äôt easy to score 1,000 points for your career in college and he‚Äôs going to do it in (essentially) three years. So it‚Äôs pretty special. I‚Äôm really really, really proud of him. He‚Äôs a great guy and he‚Äôs a force.‚Äù\nBallo noted simply that he didn‚Äôt play much at Gonzaga ‚Äî just 151 minutes over 24 games ‚Äî and expressed thanks for his opportunities since then at Arizona.\n‚ÄúBeen a long and great three years and I‚Äôm grateful for it,‚Äù Ballo said.\nUtah guard Rollie Worster gets a handful of Arizona center Oumar Ballo trying to defend his run to the bucket in the first half Saturday. Ballo hit the 1,000-point mark for his career in the second half.\nKelly Presnell, Arizona Daily Star Larsson also arrived at Arizona to join Lloyd after a year elsewhere in 2020-21, but his arrival came under different circumstances. Larsson actually started for Utah during the final 18 games of the 2020-21 season, collecting 204 points and playing much of the time at point guard.\nSo when Utah fired coach Larry Krystkowiak after the Utes went 12-13 during that COVID-limited season, the 6-5 Swede was a popular transfer portal entrant. Stadium ranked him the No. 51 rated transfer that spring, even though Utah‚Äôs rough season may have reduced his profile.\nBut less than a month after Arizona hired Lloyd, Larsson committed to the Wildcats.\n‚ÄúYou know, I thought about it a couple days ago, and you almost get emotional,‚Äù Lloyd said. ‚ÄúPelle took a chance on me. He did. I hadn‚Äôt won a game. Hadn‚Äôt coached a game. He was getting recruited by Kansas and us, and it was a battle. But he put faith in us. He came here and we‚Äôre lucky. Arizona is lucky and I‚Äôm lucky.‚Äù\nUpon arriving in Arizona during the summer of 2021, Larsson said he wanted to stay in the Pac-12 because it featured more European-style finesse and that he realized what Lloyd was bringing over from Gonzaga and wanted to build in Tucson.\n‚ÄúJust looking at the rosters and the new coaches, it just was a great fit for me,‚Äù Larsson said then.\nSome 784 points later, Larsson coincidentally surpassed the 1,000-point mark against his old team, though he didn‚Äôt make a big deal of it.\nLarsson said hitting the milestone against the Utes was ‚Äúkind of full circle, if you want to write that,‚Äù but noted that center Branden Carlson is the only Utah player left from that 2020-21 season. Then he kept his focus mostly ahead: UA has an open week before playing at Washington State on Saturday.\n‚ÄúIt goes by quick,‚Äù Larsson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a lot of fun and you just hope you don‚Äôt really pay attention to the kind of stuff that just happened. I‚Äôm happy for O and, yeah, next game is Saturday.‚Äù\nArizona Men's Basketball Press Conference | Tommy Lloyd | Sunday, Dec. 31, 2023 | After loss at Stanford (Arizona Wildcats YouTube)\nContact sports reporter Bruce Pascoe at bpascoe@tucson.com .

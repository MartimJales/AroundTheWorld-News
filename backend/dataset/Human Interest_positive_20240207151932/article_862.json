    "text": "Breece Hall rushed for 178 yards and a touchdown as the New York Jets completed their season with a 17-3 victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday afternoon in Foxborough, Mass.\nNew York (7-10) beat the Patriots for the first time since Dec. 27, 2015. New England had won the past 15 meetings between the teams.\nSunday also potentially marked the end of Bill Belichick’s tenure as coach of the Patriots. Belichick is reportedly set to meet with New England owner Robert Kraft this week to discuss his future with the organization.\nHall had a career-high 37 carries to take pressure off the Jets’ passing game in snowy, frigid conditions. He sealed the victory by rushing for a 50-yard TD with 1:47 left in the game, then punched in the ensuing two-point conversion.\nNew York quarterback Trevor Siemian completed 8 of 20 passes for 70 yards.\nBailey Zappe finished with 88 yards and two interceptions on 12-for-30 passing for the Patriots (4-13), who lost at least 13 games in a single season for the first time since the 1992 campaign.\nEzekiel Elliott picked up 54 yards on 13 carries as New England was outgained 254-119 and went 1-for-14 on third down.\nJust over four minutes after the Patriots failed to convert on fourth-and-1, Greg Zuerlein made a 33-yard field goal to put the Jets up 9-3 with 8:08 to play in the fourth.\nZappe was later picked off by Ashtyn Davis, who then fumbled on the return, and New England recovered with 2:44 left.\nHowever, Zappe and the Patriots weren’t as fortunate two plays later, as Tony Adams came down with another interception and held on to set up Hall’s trip to the end zone.\nNeither team managed to record a first down until Hall rushed for a gain of 3 on third-and-1 with 5:28 left in the first quarter. Seven plays later, Zuerlein booted a 21-yard field goal to give New York a 3-0 edge.\nNew England’s Chad Ryland made good on a 30-yard field goal to tie things at 3 early in the second.\nZuerlein put New York back up by three with a 40-yarder with 6:07 left in the first half. He had a chance to make it 9-3 by the break, but his 49-yard attempt with 21 seconds to go clanged off the left upright.\n–Field Level Media",

    "text": "A woman in her 90s was rescued from beneath the rubble of a collapsed house Saturday in western Japan, five days after a powerful earthquake struck the region and killed more than 126 people.\n>> Read more trending news\nThe woman, who has not been identified, had been trapped beneath the first floor of the two-story structure in the town of Suzu after the 7.56 magnitude earthquake rocked the area, The New York Times reported. She was rescued at about 8:20 p.m. local time and was taken to an area hospital, according to the officer of Ishikawa Prefecture.\nThe Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the woman was responsive but was believed to be suffering from hypothermia, the BBC reported.\nOn Sunday, a doctor told reporters that the woman was well enough to speak, but her legs were injured, according to CNN .\nKume Takanori, a member of the emergency rescue team, told NHK that the woman’s knees had been stuck under furniture between the first and second floor, CNN reported. It took hours to free her, Takanori said.\nThe Times , citing experts, reported that the window for finding survivors after an earthquake is typically three days. It is possible to survive for longer periods, depending on access to water and food, temperatures in the area and the extent of the person’s injuries.\nThe death toll from the earthquake continues to rise, with at least 222 people still reported as missing, according to the newspaper.\nWajima city has had the highest number of fatalities, with 69, The Guardian reported. Suzu has 38 deaths.\nLatest headlines: Hawaii wildfires: Police find additional remains, raises death toll to 99 ‘Life-threatening rainfall event’: Heavy rain leaving roads, subways flooded; some left stranded Hawaii wildfires: First group of residents return to Lahaina Hawaii wildfires: Officials say death toll has dropped to 97 due to DNA tests Morocco earthquake: Death toll tops over 2,000; area suffers major damage © 2024 Cox Media Group",

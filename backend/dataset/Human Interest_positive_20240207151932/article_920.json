    "text": "Amid tough competition from some of Colorado’s best wrestlers, Fort Morgan’s grapplers still found ways to pick up a few wins at the Gary Daum Classic at Niwot High School on Saturday.\nThe packed gym, which housed 259 competitors, saw Pueblo County run away with the team victory.\n175-pounder Noah Aguirre led the way for the Mustangs, as he barreled his way through his weight class — thanks to two pins and a 5-0 decision — before finishing runner-up to Berthoud’s KalebCooper, who pinned him in the second period.\nCarson Roth (190), who earned a bye in the first round of his bracket, battled all the way to the end of his first match with Berthoud’s Ben Schroeder before losing in a 5-2 decision. He won his next three matches to secure himself a spot in the third-place match, where Schroeder once again took him down, this time with a 7-3 decision.\nConner Derry, at 106 pounds, pinned his first two opponents from Resurrection Christian and Berthoud, then lost a few more matches to guys from Thornton, Pueblo county and Horizon. He placed sixth in his weight class.\nCristofer Juan, at 113s, won his first match with a first-round pin of Frederick’s Giavanni Anher, but couldn’t handle what Pueblo County’s Brogan Bartholomew threw at him in his quarterfinals match. As he worked his way through the consolation bracket, he picked up three more victories in four matches, which helped him secure fifth place.\nBenjamin Fritzler added his name to the list of Fort Morgan placers as he brushed off tough losses to wrestlers from Horizon and Pueblo County to win four more, including his fifth-place contest with Holy Family’s Fisher Reenan, who he defeated 5-2.\nNate Dahl, all the way up in 215, rounded out the Mustangs’s podium finishes with his own sixth-place nod. Mountain View’s Connor Mann proved too much for him to handle in his opening match, but he rebounded nicely with a win over Thompson Valley’s CJ James before hitting brick walls named Trevor Moore (Berthoud) and Carter Harmon (Roosevelt).",

    "text": "CROSS RIVER, N.Y. - On Jan. 4, the bowling teams went to Cortland Lanes for matches against Hen Hud and Briarcliff. Unfortunately, the girls hit choppy seas versus the first place Sailors and were shutout 7-0. But the boys had better luck versus the Bears. Winning four games to three, the series high scorer was glad to take the victory. “It feels really good,” said John Curtin. “We were very consistent.” His 406 series score said as much, and differentiates from last year. “I’m definitely way better,” he said. The bowler mostly credits his positioning. “I line myself up by the arrows and not in the middle,” said Curtin. That more often leaves him hitting to the left or right of the front pin, but in terms of the high game he was just behind. Connor Harty had a 167 and wasn’t worried about his low game of 97. “Bowling, it’s fun stuff,” he said. A series score of 377, Harty was just ahead of Nick Maiorana’s 370. A 157 among his game, being ahead of the curve in relation to the bowler’s hook has been a bit more random. “I’m just kind of tossing it,” said Maiorana. Good enough for the win, the good day for the boys didn’t mean a total loss for the girls. “I’d rather try my hardest versus a good team than not try so hard against a bad team,” said Kayleigh Plutzke. Unfortunately, the anticipation was good for only a third best 317 series score among her teammates. “I could do better,” she said. A new ball on the way, the Wolf sees a better fit making a difference. “My fingers keep getting stuck. That makes my arm tired and wastes a lot of energy,” Plutzke lamented. She also intends to take the new sphere round the bend. “A hooking ball,” she said, “It can hook all the way to the middle, and I think that will improve my game.” That said, the five newcomers to the girls’ team are on the upswing, according to Coach Paul Plutzke. “A lot of them were averaging in their 60s, and now they are consistently getting over 100,” he said. One of those is Lillian Silverman and she credits being in full swing. “I’m just following through,” she assured. The high series score did go to Sky Corradino (327), but in the end, no one is really counting when it comes to the camaraderie. “Everybody is fun and chill,” concluded Silverman.

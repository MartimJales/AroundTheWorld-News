He proceeded to wake the sleeping residents, four adults and three dogs, in the home and ensured everyone was outside before the Fire Department’s arrival.”\nTwenty-six firefighters ended up responding to the fire.\nSanfanandre’s unit was the first unit to arrive and found heavy fire in the garage that extended into the home.\n“Firefighters attacked the fire utilizing three hose lines and brought the fire under control in less than one hour,” he said.\nThere didn’t appear to be any injuries.\nThe cause of the fire remained under investigation.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "(CNN) — Greece has reopened the ancient palace where Alexander the Great became King of Macedonia some 2,400 years ago after it underwent restoration.\nThe Palace of Aigai, formally known as the Royal Metropolis of the Macedonians, was the largest building in classical Greece, covering an area of approximately 15,000 square meters, according to the Greek Cultural Ministry.\nIt was mostly built by Alexander the Great’s father Philip II of Macedonia in the 4th century BCE.\n“It is the place where Alexander the Great was crowned king, a short while after his father’s assassination, to start his glorious campaign,” said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the opening ceremony Friday.\nAlexander’s rule saw him conquering a huge area stretching from modern-day Greece to Egypt, Iran, and as far as northern India and central Asia.\nHis empire, then unseen in Western history, began what historians call the Hellenistic period, lasting from his death to the rise of the Roman Empire.\nHis conquests set the foundation for the Greek influence in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea for the next 1,000 years. Many important texts in this region, including the early versions of the New Testament, were written in Greek.\nRomans destroyed the palace in 148 BCE and it was frequently looted in the coming centuries.\nRestoring the birth place of such an impressive empire was no easy task. It took the Greek government 16 years, with help from the European Union and more than 20 million euros ($21.9 million) according to the Greek Cultural Ministry.\n“What we are doing today is an event of global importance and international scope,” Mitsotakis said.",

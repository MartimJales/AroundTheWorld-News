    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \"By any means necessary\" -- a phrase used in recent weeks by [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers) head coach Todd Bowles and quarterback [Baker Mayfield](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield) -- proved to be a viable strategy in defeating the [Carolina Panthers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers) 9-0 on Sunday to earn their third consecutive NFC South title. It was also the second for head coach Todd Bowles and the first in the Bucs' post-Tom Brady era, finishing with a 9-8 record. Mayfield fought through a rib injury that disrupted the synchronicity of the offense, but he led three field goal drives with [Chase McLaughlin](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3150744/chase-mclaughlin) -- signed this offseason in the post-Brady purge -- hitting 36, 57 and 39-yard kicks while the defense, led by safety [Antoine Winfield Jr](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4034790/antoine-winfield-jr).",

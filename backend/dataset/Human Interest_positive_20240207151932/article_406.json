    "text": "Now is the moment: on Valentine’s Day in 2024, the City of Santa Clarita is set to revive “The Big I Do,” a spectacular wedding celebration that follows the simultaneous marriage of numerous couples in this unusual wedding event. Couples that participate are said to have the opportunity to win a honeymoon cruise courtesy of Princess Cruises. The professionals at City Hall Ceremonies will handle all of the preparation and execution, so forget about worrying about seating charts, centerpieces and DJ reservations. This celebration of love is only a small portion of the expense of a typical wedding, thanks to the kind gifts of nearby wedding vendors. A cooked breakfast, exquisite floral arrangements, décor, delicious wedding cakes, a DJ, a photographer, picture booths and much more are all available to couples. Additionally, there are other rewards that registered couples can win such as custom wedding bands, elegant headwear for the bride, and a seven-night Princess Cruise as the grand prizes! The winning couple will collaborate with a Princess cruise specialist to customize their honeymoon cruise experience. Couples must register for “The Big I Do” by Jan. 31 and then exchange vows on February 14, Valentine’s Day, to be eligible. The City’s website is accepting submissions from participants until 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 31, for their one-minute love tale. During the week of February 5, 2024, the City of Santa Clarita will feature exciting love stories on its social media platforms, encouraging fans to cast their votes for their preferred pair on the official voting website. During “The Big I Do” reception, the couple who receives the most votes will be revealed and they will get an exclusive honeymoon on a Princess Cruise.

    "text": "The Plantation Course at Kapalua, host of The Sentry this week, is a bomber’s paradise. The severe elevation changes, coupled with the breezy conditions, allow players to swing away in the hopes of big drives. And on this crazy golf course, big drives are easy to come by. Just ask Max Homa , who blasted a 477-yard drive on the par-4 7th hole during Saturday’s third round. “For it being uphill into the wind with no roll, I was pretty proud of this one,” Homa posted on his X account. Homa was obviously kidding, as the 7th hole is a downhill 525-yard par-4. It sweeps to the right, and a speed slot exists on the left side of the fairway. Should a player find the left side of the short grass at the 7th, their tee balls consequently roll forever. That is precisely what happened to Homa, whose drive on Saturday marked the longest tee shot in a PGA Tour event since 2003, the beginning of the ShotLink era. But the longest drives on the PGA Tour typically happen at Kapalua. For instance, during the 2022-23 PGA Tour season, the six longest drives of the year were at The Plantation Course. Luke List had the longest—a 459-yard bomb—which, coincidentally, also came at the par-4 7th hole. Then, this week, Chris Kirk , the 54-hole leader, recorded a 428-yard drive on the par-4 12th during Saturday’s third round. Out of the 59 players in the field this week, Kirk’s 428-yard drive ranks 17th in driving distance. That just goes to show you how Kapalua is truly a bomber’s paradise.

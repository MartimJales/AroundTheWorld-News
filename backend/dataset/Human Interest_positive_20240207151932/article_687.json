    "text": "| | Anisha Rosnah Isa-Kalebic, the fiancée of Prince Mateen of Brunei. Photo from Isa-Kalebic's fanpage's Instagram As reported by Esquire Magazine, Isa-Kalebic is the proprietor of the fashion brand Silk Collective and the co-founder of Authentirary, a tourism company that offers cultural experiences in various cities. She graduated from the University of Bath in the U.K. The prince’s fiancée comes from a noble family background, as her grandfather Pehin Dato Isa is Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah’s special advisor. He also held roles such as deputy attorney general and deputy chief minister in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Isa-Kalebic’s brother Danial Deen Isa-Kalebic is reportedly a close friend of Prince Mateen as well. Though little details about Isa-Kalebic and the prince’s romantic relationship have been disclosed, the couple is believed to have been dating for several years, according to People Magazine. They have been spotted together at several public events, including the wedding of Princess Azemah, the prince’s sister, in January last year. However, it was only earlier this month that the prince publicly shared their [first photo](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/trend/prince-mateen-of-brunei-reveals-first-photo-with-fiancee-4696888.html) together. With their engagement being announced in October last year, the couple is set to have a grand 10-day wedding, spanning from Sunday to Jan. 16 and honoring Brunei Royal Family traditions. The nuptials will reportedly feature an Islamic ceremony on Jan. 11, followed by a reception and a parade in Brunei’s capital Bandar Seri Begawan on Jan. 14. Prince Mateen, 32, is Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah’s 10th child and is sixth in line to the throne. A helicopter pilot and a major in the Royal Brunei Air Force, he has also played polo for his country in the 2017 and 2019 SEA Games. Hong Kong’s Tatler Magazine listed him among Asia’s top 50 most eligible bachelors in 2016.",

Amber Campbell from [Co Armagh](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/co-armagh) has been singing as long as she has been talking and is ready to take the next step by releasing her first single. Her mother Mary said there is no stopping the schoolgirl who continues to make the proud at every performance.

One of Amber's covers has received over 633k views on Facebook with Mary saying the family were \"absolutely blown away by the response\". She continued: \"An email came through from the Northern Ireland Country Awards saying they had seen her video and asked if would she like to perform - she was absolutely blown away as it is such an honour for a 9-year-old and will be the youngest ever to perform at this event. \"She is so excited about it as she will meet some of the biggest names in country music.\" Amber is going to Donegal this month where she will be releasing her first single. \"Amber is a quiet girl who is quite grounded takes everything in her stride and enjoys all the simple things,\" her mother added. \"2024 is going to be an exciting year with her new release and the country awards - she also has a few big bookings and charity events, she’s a busy girl but very excited to see where it all takes her. \"As a parent it’s amazing to see your child on stage to get standing ovations and watch her grow with confidence, it’s truly amazing and we are all very proud of her.\" Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp [Click this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LU5TE4vC7DOJ3M6yruB11W) or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

A graduate of Northwestern University, she has been working at PEOPLE since 2022.

News and the Today show and is a Boston University graduate. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 7, 2024 05:07PM EST Ryan Anderson and Gypsy Rose Blanchard . Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty\nGypsy Rose Blanchard and her husband Ryan Scott Anderson are more in love than ever.\nGypsy, 32, and Anderson opened up to PEOPLE about how their marriage works at the premiere of Lifetime's The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard in New York City on Friday.\nThe Louisiana teacher, who married Gypsy in 2022 , says of his wife, “I just want her to know I'm here for her. I show her and I tell her all the time. It's one of those where it doesn't matter what we go through, we're still going to be together.”\n“It's one of those where we have ‘it,’ that people say,” he continues, as Blanchard adds that they have “that ‘it’ factor.”\nAnderson says he’s “proud” of their connection — and that special something they share. “We're so close. We've had that bond, you know, in prison, we had to create that to create this relationship, you know, so we had the emotional part down, but now it's the physical and so it's all coming together, it's coming full circle.”\nRyan Anderson and Gypsy Rose Blanchard attend \"The Prison Confessions Of Gypsy Rose Blanchard\" Red Carpet Event on January 05, 2024 in New York City. Jamie McCarthy/Getty\nGypsy Rose was released from prison on Dec. 28 after serving eight years of her 10-year sentence — she was charged with second-degree murder for the 2015 death of her mother, Dee Dee, whom her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn , killed. Gypsy was a victim of Munchausen by proxy, a form of abuse in which a guardian may seek attention or sympathy by making their child ill or exaggerating their illness.\nShe and Anderson wed while she was still in prison, after he sent her a letter in 2020. Now that they’re able to be together all the time, he says “it's even better than I ever could imagine.”\nRead PEOPLE's Cover Story on Gypsy Rose Blanchard's Prison Release After Murdering Mom: 'Ready for Freedom' Gypsy Rose Blanchard attends \"The Prison Confessions Of Gypsy Rose Blanchard\" Red Carpet Event on January 05, 2024 in New York City.

I know every female deserves that. And Gypsy's already got the style of dress she wants. And it kind of shocked me.”\nHe continues, \"Somebody asked her that question the other day, and I was like, 'Wow, that was specific,' and she had it ready.

    "text": "By the Companion Animal Placement Assistance (CAPA) Winston is a male 5-year-old, black and white pointer mix available for adoption at the Lompoc Animal Center. Winston weighs approximately 67 lbs. and is a mature, loyal, and gentle companion. Winston is obedient, with a friendly demeanor and impeccable manners, and the staff brags that he is a joy to be around. Whether you’re enjoying a leisurely walk through the neighborhood or seeking a friend for life, Winston excels on a leash and is always up for the journey. Winston’s adoption fees include his neuter, microchip, vaccinations, flea treatment, and health/wellness exam. The Lompoc division of Santa Barbara County Animal Services is located at 1501 West Central in Lompoc. Stop by between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday or call (833) 422-8413 for more information about available animals throughout the County. The friendly staff will be happy to assist you. Are you looking for a different type of pet? Visit https://countyofsb.org/phd/animal/petsearch.sbc to see all of the local adoptable animals.

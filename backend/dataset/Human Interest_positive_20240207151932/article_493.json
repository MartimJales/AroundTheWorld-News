Darby had just drained a 3-pointer to tie the game in the third quarter against Kentucky on Sunday, but Tennessee's 11-0 run was fueled with back-to-back blocks from Key.

Key finished with a season-high six blocks and added two points and two rebounds. Tennessee trailed 49-39 at halftime and outscored Kentucky 48-20 in the second half. Senior forward Rickea Jackson had a game-high 27 points against Kentucky (8-8, 1-1) and went 11-for-18 shooting. She added seven rebounds, three assists and a steal.

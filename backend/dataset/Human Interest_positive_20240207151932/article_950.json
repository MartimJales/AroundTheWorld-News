    "text": "Perth is enjoying a boom in property prices, with the Western Australian capital surging in value growth over the past 12 months, a real estate analyst has revealed.\nCoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen appeared on\nSunrise on Monday, sharing the good news for those who have already purchased in the vibrant city.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Eliza Owen visits Brekky Central to talk about the boom in market value of Perth property.\nStream the world's best reality, entertainment and true crime shows for free on 7Bravo on\n7plus >>\n“Perth values were up 15 per cent last year and at this stage it still looks like the frontrunner for 2024,” Eliza said.\n“Values were up about 1.3 per cent alone in the past four weeks across Perth.\n“The median price point is still relatively affordable at about $660,000 and migration trends are pretty strong to WA.”\nAccording to the\nlatest property report from CoreLogic — four of the strongest performing suburbs were in Perth — Brookdale, Armadale, Hilbert and Ravenswood.\nThe ACT suburb of Whitlam rounded out the top five.\n“The strongest performers were in the southeast market of Perth,” Eliza said.\n“Armadale is an example we will have talked about recently,” she added.\nAccording to the same report, Sydney has the nation’s top five most expensive suburbs — all in the city’s well-heeled east.\nBellevue Hill, Vaucluse, Double Bay, Rose Bay and Dover Heights were the top five, in that order.\nTurning her attention to weaker growth markets, Eliza looked to Sydney, particularly suburbs with an already hefty price tag.\n“Some of the weaker parts of the market are in the higher-end of Sydney — think the north shore, North Sydney and the inner east of Melbourne.”\nBut Eliza did say there was good news for Melbourne.\n“I think for Melbourne since it hasn’t moved much in value since the pandemic, it could become relatively attractive at a time interest rates are falling,” she said.\n“It might be a bit more affordable for buyers.”\nStream Free on",

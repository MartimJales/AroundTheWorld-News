    "text": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — [Bills Mafia](/meetthemafia) is known for supporting charitable causes outside of Western New York, and on Sunday, the donations started to flow once again. Not long after the Bills secured a playoff berth, thanks to Tennessee knocking off the Jacksonville Jaguars, before 4 p.m. Sunday, Bills Mafia co-founder and 26 Shirts founder Del Reid had an idea. \"Sure why not. Just fired off $17 to [@KingHenry_2](https://twitter.com/KingHenry_2)’s foundation #BillsMafia [twoallfoundation.org](https://twoallfoundation.org/),\" [he said on X](https://twitter.com/DelReid/status/1744101805905031343), the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, alluding to Titans running back Derrick Henry. Henry had 19 carries for 153 yards and a touchdown in leading the Titans to victory. Perhaps more importantly, he's also the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year Award nominee in back-to-back seasons. The Man of the Year award recognizes NFL players who contribute to community services off the field, and who also thrive on the field. Henry created the [Two All Foundation](https://twoallfoundation.org/) \"to level the playing field for today’s youth so that their future success is not limited by the circumstances of their upbringing, background, disability, or influence,\" according to the organizations website. The foundation also honors his grandmother, Gladys Henry, who played a key role as he grew up. Reid was recently named the 2023 Buffalo Bills Fan of the Year, with former Buffalo wide receiver Stevie Johnson announcing the recognition at Highmark Stadium. Tennessee's win made it clear what's at stake in Sunday night's game in Miami against the Dolphins. If the Bills win, they will claim the AFC East Division crown and be the No. 2 seed when the playoffs start next week. The Steelers be the No. 7 seed coming to Highmark Stadium. If the Bills lose, they would be a wild card and the No. 7 seed, meaning another game next week in South Florida.",

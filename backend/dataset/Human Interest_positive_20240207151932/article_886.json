    "text": "Houston, Min. (WXOW) - The International Owl Center in Houston, Minnesota recently concluded an exciting weekend as they hosted their annual Minnesota Neighbors Weekend. From January 6h to January 7th, residents of Houston, Fillmore, and Winona counties enjoyed complimentary admission to the center, offering a unique opportunity to connect with these fascinating creatures. Visitors had the chance to partake in educational programs as well as explore an array of engaging owl-related exhibits. \"We have live owls, and we have mounted specimens of every species that occurs in North America\", says Karla Bloem, executive director of the International Owl Center. \"We have kid's owl art from all over the world. We have skulls of different owls. We have wingspans that show how big they are when their wings are spread because they look a whole lot bigger when their wings are open than when they're sitting on a perch. And we have a gift shop chalk-full of all kinds of owl stuff.\" They will also be hosting a Wisconsin Neighbor Weekend on February 3rn and 4th. Residents from Trempealeau, La Crosse, and Vernon counties will also be granted free admission. For more information you can check out their [website](https://www.internationalowlcenter.org/).",

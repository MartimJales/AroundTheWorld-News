    "text": "Lights, laughter and lifts – Dancing With The Stars returned with a burst of sequins on Sunday night.\nThe RTE One show – hosted by Doireann Garrihy and Jennifer Zamparelli – welcomed 11 nervous celebrities to the dance floor as the show kicked off the new year.\nFormer Dancing With The Stars contestants Ellen Keane and Suzanne Jackson were spotted in the crowds as the class of 2024 got off to a showstopping start with their pink-filled opening number where they danced alongside their pro dance partners, judges Brian Redmond, Loraine Barry and Arthur Gourounlian.\nUp first to dance was Virgin Media star Katja Mia and her pro dance partner Ervinas Merfeldas took on “celebrity killer” the samba to the song My Love by Leigh-Anne featuring Ayra Starr.\nLoraine said: “Opening the show, the song, the vibes are oozing out of you. You are so samba tonight. You really need the hip action and you were rotating those hips.\n“You smashed the samba tonight,” she said. Arthur said: “You performed the celebrity killer, which is samba and guess what? You killed it.\n“You raised the bar so high.” And Brian said Katja had some of the “most natural body rhythm” he had ever seen over the years. The couple scored 21 points – a strong start to the show.\nChampion jockey Davy Russell took the reins with his pro dance partner Kylee Vincent and danced the Paso Doble to Crazy Horses by The Osmonds. But Arthur said he felt like Davy was “walking to the shops”.\nBrian said Davy had some “pretty big riding boots to fill” after Nina Carberry made it to the final on last year’s show. But he praised Davy’s debut on the show, saying he did better than Nina’s debut.\nLoraine said she was “impressed” with Davy’s core strength and his “masculinity”. Speaking afterwards, Davy said: “Nothing can compare you for this.” The pair scored 19 points on Sunday night’s show.\nNext up, presenter and broadcaster Laura Fox showed her rhythm as she danced a Jive with her partner Denys Samson to River Deep, Mountain High from the Glee Cast.\nBrian said the way Laura uses her arms is “so natural and so instinctive” but said she had work to do with her legs, which is out of sync with her dance partner Denys.\nBut Loraine praised her dance calling it a “fun, fab, jive”. Arthur said it was a “sassy, energetic jive”. The couple scored 21 points.\nFair City actor Shane Quigley Murphy, who is partnered with Laura Nolan, took the salsa to the studio as they danced to Where Did You Go? by Jax Jones & MNEK.\nLoraine said: “It’s a wowsers. It’s like go big or go home. It’s huge. What is in the water tonight because this is amazing.” Arthur said Shane had rhythm in his hips, with the dance suiting him. And Brian added Laura and Shane’s lifts were “exceptional”.\nFormer RTE Nine O’Clock newsreader Eileen Dunne – who retired last year after 42 years working at the station – showed there was no time to slow down as she and her pro dance partner Robert Rowiński danced an elegant American Smooth to I Am Woman by Peggy Lee.\nBut despite their gracious moves around the dance floor, they failed to impress the judges scoring 14 points, the second lowest points of the night.\nParalympian Jason Smyth and his pro partner Karen Byrne took to the floor and performed a Foxtrot to They Can’t Take That Away from Me by Frank Sinatra & Natalie Cole.\nArthur said his competitiveness, rhythm and determination will help him in the competition. Speaking after his dance, Jason said he was doing it for his kids. The couple scored 17 points.\nParalympian Champion Jason Smyth with his Partner Karen Byrne during Dancing with the Stars week one\nDrag star Blu Hydrangea and their partner Simone Arena were the seventh couple to dance tonight. You’re Free by Icona Pop & Ulta Naté was the soundtrack for their Cha Cha.\nLoraine described it as “sassy, sexy and so much fun” and thanked the pair for a “textbook cha-cha-cha”, while Brian and Arthur also praised their dance. The pair scored 24 points, the highest score of the night.\nFormer Miss World Rosanna Davison and her pro partner Stephen Vincent were the next couple to perform. Their Waltz was danced to Come Away with Me by Norah Jones, which impressed the judges.\nArthur said the dance was “so dreamy and so graceful” but he urged her to relax on the dance floor. Brian said: “I was very impressed with how you moved across the dance floor. Not a bad waltz.” The pair scored 17 points.\nWild Youth singer David Whelan is paired with Salome Chacua and danced a Tango to Bad Habits by Ed Sheeran feat. Bring Me the Horizon. Brian said Whelan was “one to watch”.\nLoraine said: “It was drama and intensity and you both had that”, saying “it was excellent”. The pair scored 23 points.\nWild Youth Frontman David Whelan with his Partner Salome Chachua during Dancing with the Stars\nTikTok star Miriam Mullins is partnered with new professional dancer Montel Hewson they took to the dancefloor with a Quickstep to Fascination by Alphabeat.\nLoraine said Miriam “moved really well around the floor” but urged the social media influencer to focus on her posture. Arthur said she had a “fire in her belly”, while Brian added that Miriam’s springing had “more springs than a mattress factory”. The couple scored 18 points.\nThe final couple to dance were actor Rory Cowan and new dancer Jillian Bromwich. They danced a Charleston to When I’m Sixty-Four by Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers.\nThe 64-year-old added his comedic charm to the dance, saying he “loved every minute of it.” Arthur: “They say they saved the best for last but I’m not sure but it was fun though”, saying he has musicality and should push himself harder.\nRory added: “You can dance good or you can dance bad. Doesn’t matter as long as you dance.” Loraine said Rory has “rhythm and agility” and encouraged him to keep dancing.\nAsked by host Doireann Garrihy if Mrs Brown would’ve approved, Rory said: “She would’ve loved it”, saying he plans to retire and go out with a bang by taking part in the biggest show in the country. The couple scored 11 points, the lowest score of the night.\nThe glitz, glamour, and nail-biting competition will all unfold as the series continues on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player next Sunday, January 14 at 6:30pm.",

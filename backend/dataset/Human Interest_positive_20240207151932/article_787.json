    "text": "Primanti Bros. sending sandwiches to Tennessee Titans as thanks for ensuring Steelers berth in Wild Card playoff Pittsburghers are celebrating the Steelers' [securing a Wild Card spot in the AFC's postseason](https://www.wtae.com/article/steelers-playoffs-wild-card-2024/46301133) in plenty of different ways. The celebration at Primanti Bros., unsurprisingly, involves a little more coleslaw than most. The restaurant chain has announced that it is sending sandwich kits to the members of the Tennessee Titans for beating the Jacksonville Jaguars in Sunday's regular-season game. That victory was the final piece in the puzzle to ensure the Steelers (10-7) a spot in the playoffs. Primanti's said it was preparing enough sandwiches for Nashville to feed the entire team, including head coach and former Steelers player, [Mike Vrabel.](https://www.wtae.com/article/delay-makes-showdown-bigger-for-undefeated-steelers-titans/34455337) \"We all need a little help from our friends,\" said Adam Golomb, CEO of Primanti's, in a statement. \"And we’ve got a soft spot for Vrabel and his squad in Tennessee – unless we’re meeting them on the field. But for today – the Titans were our friends.\" The Steelers will face either the Buffalo Bills, the Miami Dolphins or the Kansas City Chiefs, depending on the results of Sunday night's game between the Bills and Dolphins.",

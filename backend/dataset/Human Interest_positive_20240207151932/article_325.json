    "text": "This year was Joe Bauer's first time attending Summernats but his 1968 Dodge Charger made such an impression that he left holding aloft two of the car festival's most coveted prizes.\nThe Queenslander spent the past two years building up his prized-machine which he brought over from Texas, United States, and — with the help of some mates and hot-rod experts — stripped, and fitted with a 3,000 horsepower engine.\n\"Labour of love and passion,\" he said.\n\"It's an elite level car build, but we also built it for driveability and performance as well.\"\nJoe Bauer has been named the Summernats Grand Champion for 2024. ( ABC News: Ian Cutmore )\nIt was enough to impress judges and festival goers alike, with Mr Bauer named both Summernats Grand Champion and People's Choice Champion for his charger's appearance, quality and driving performance.\n\"I let it unleash and went as hard and fast as I possibly could in the driving event,\" he said.\nJoe Bauer spent two-years modifying his 1968 Dodge Charger. ( ABC News: Ian Cutmore )\nThe 36th Summernats attracted 2,500 cars and sold 130,000 entry passes to the four-day event, with organisers declaring Saturday the \"biggest day\" in the festival's history.\nThe event wasn't without its problems though, with police investigating a brawl that broke out on Saturday involving dozens of people, some of whom are seen wearing \"crowd safety\" vests in videos circulated on social media.\nCrowd-favourite 'Lynchy' wins Burnout Masters Andrew Lynch burning rubber in his Corolla during the Burnout Masters final. ( ABC News: Donal Sheil )\nAfter years of skidding his Corolla \"Lynchy\" in the Burnout Masters, crowd-favourite Andrew Lynch claimed his first win.\nThe Victorian wheat farmer is well-known on the burnout pad for his speedy manoeuvres, but he said his fast driving meant he kept \"losing smoke\" in past competitions.\nHe altered his technique heading into this year's final against the 10 \"best-of-the-best\" skidders, and it paid off.\nIt was the first time Andrew Lynch has won the Summernats burnout competition. ( ABC News: Donal Sheil )\n“To be in the masters you have to do a spot-on burnout,\" Mr Lynch said.\n\"You’ve got to be on it [the accelerator], you’ve got to have smoke, you have to have driver control, you have to have both your tyres off, and at Summernats you have to last over a minute, and you have to drive off under your own power.\"\nChris Orchard was named runner-up in his NASCAR-powered VH Commodore, with Robert Cottrell coming in third in his 4DH8RS XD Falcon.\nMulletfest winner 'bringing the '80s back' Loading... A record 141 mullet-toting revheads crossed the stage for the Mulletfest competition.\nThe Summernats festival hosts the first round of heats for the nationwide Mulletfest competition, with the winners going on to compete at the grand final in the Hunter Valley in December.\nAnton Medvidovic has been growing his mullet for two-and-a-half-years. ( ABC News: Donal Sheil )\nAnton Medvidovic — who has been growing his mullet for two-and-a-half years — was found to have the best \"vintage\" hairdo and went on to be named the overall Summernats Grand Mullet Champion.\n\"Overwhelmed; I never thought in my whole life I would get this,\" he said.\n\"I was brought up in the '80s so I thought I'd bring the '80s back.\"\nAnton Medvidovic was surprised to be named the overall winner of the Mulletfest competition. ( ABC News: Donal Sheil )\nCompetitors were judged on the style and length of their hairdos as well as their stage presence, with the competition broken into different age groups and categories, including everyday mullet, extreme and senior.\n\"I saw other mullets and I thought, 'oh, I'm kind of in contention but I think this guy, or this guy, or this guy will get it,\" Mr Medvidovic said.\n\"But never thought, never thought I'd come out on top.\"\nPosted 13m ago 13 minutes ago Sun 7 Jan 2024 at 10:22pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Police investigating brawl at Summernats with footage showing some involved wearing 'crowd safety' vests Revheads rejoice as nation's 'wildest' car show Summernats rumbles into Canberra Dad-and-daughter duo rebuild dream car after engine fire, now it's a Summernats grand champion contender",

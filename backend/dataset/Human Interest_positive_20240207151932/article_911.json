    "text": "OXFORD, Miss. — Mikaylah Williams paused a beat. The LSU freshman guard was setting up a 3-pointer on the right wing, and her defender — Snudda Collins of Ole Miss — was on the floor after falling and sliding all the way to the low block. Williams created that space. She had driven right, hit the brakes, shrugged off Collins and stepped behind the 3-point arc, where she stopped and drilled shot, her third 3-pointer of the first half. \"I tried to reject the screen, and she tried to body up,\" Williams, \"so I snatched, and she fell. I was trying to set my feet, get the ball in my hands and get my shot.\" That bucket gave the LSU women’s basketball team an 11-point lead on Sunday afternoon in the Sandy and John Black Pavilion, where it beat Ole Miss 84-73 in front of 9,074 fans, the largest crowd in the eight-year history of the venue and in program history. The shot from Williams was one of seven 3-pointers that the No. 7 Tigers (15-1, 2-0 SEC) made in the first half. The hot start helped them build a 13-point halftime cushion, which was large enough to withstand both their dip in efficiency and Ole Miss’ strong start to the second half in which the Rebels (11-4, 1-1) retook the lead. But, largely thanks to the play of Williams and Angel Reese, LSU weathered the run, rebuilt its lead and controlled the fourth quarter of its first Southeastern Conference road game of the season. \"It was physical,\" LSU coach Kim Mulkey said, \"and we weathered the storm when they cut it.\" After shooting 7 of 12 from the floor and 4 of 5 from 3-point range, Williams scored 20 points to pair with seven rebounds and four steals. Reese, who was particularly effective in the second half, finished with 21 points, nine rebounds and four assists. Ole Miss opted to play man defense, chose to apply pressure when LSU brought the ball up the floor and matched the Tigers’ length around the rim, where it successfully evened the rebounding battle and prevented LSU from finding easy buckets. As a result, the Tigers had trouble creating easy offense in each of their two favorite places to score — in the paint and in transition. At the end of the first half, LSU had a double-digit lead anyway because it shot so well from the outside. But to start the third quarter, LSU cooled off from the perimeter and still struggled to score on the inside. It missed 10 of its first 11 shots from the field, while Ole Miss battled back to take the lead, after earning 17 trips to the free-throw line. Then, Williams and Reese took over. LSU was down one point in the third quarter when Williams took a charge from Collins. It led by one when she swiped possession from a Rebels guard and pulled up for a 3-pointer from the left wing in transition. And then, it was up by five points when she notched her second steal of the quarter, raced in transition, euro-stepped a defender and dished to Aneesah Morrow, who converted a layup. \"A freshman that's not afraid of the big moment,\" Mulkey said about Williams. \"A young lady that's very talented, and it was good for me to see her in her first SEC road game, knowing that she was gonna see older players, knowing that she was gonna have to guard older players.\" In the second half, Reese scored 10 points and dished out a pair of assists. Against the press, the LSU guards started finding her around half court, where, in a few instances, she took a couple of dribbles and fired a pass to an open teammate cutting along the baseline. As LSU rebuilt its lead, Reese found her competitive flair, motioning to the crowd after buckets and taunting the Ole Miss student section after defensive stops. Overall, Ole Miss attempted five more free throws than LSU, outscored it by eight points in the paint, and finished with advantages in both blocks and steals. But the Tigers shot 8 of 13 from the 3-point line, where it outscored Ole Miss by 15 points. \"I thought, as you saw, we're not a polished product,\" Mulkey said, \"but we can score the ball. We scored 84 points, and really I didn't think we had a great game.\" Flau'jae Johnson added 16 points, six rebounds and two blocks on 7-of-12 shooting, and Morrow and Hailey Van Lith scored 13 points each. Morrow pulled down eight rebounds, and Van Lith recorded four assists but committed seven turnovers. LSU will return home to face Texas A&M on Thursday at 7 p.m.",

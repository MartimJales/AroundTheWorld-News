Love, in his first season as the starter, had 14 of those touchdown passes on third downs. Only [Patrick Mahomes](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes) has more (15). Wicks' two touchdown catches gave the Packers 31 receiving touchdowns by first- and second-year players, which is tied with the 1960 New York Titans for the second-most such scores in NFL history, trailing only the 1961 Oilers (44), according to Elias Sports Bureau.

What\\u2019s the harm in a few white lies when she\\u2019ll never see Will again? Back in England, Will can\\u2019t stop thinking about Lily. When his events company needs a costume designer last minute for the Royal Windsor Festival, it\\u2019s like fate is knocking on his door. He can hire Lily and see if the spark is still there. Except he hasn't been entirely honest with Lily... Can a holiday fling become something more, or are there too many untruths between Lilith and Will? A gorgeously uplifting romance for fans of Portia MacIntosh and Trisha Ashley. Praise for Someone Like You\\u2018I loved this book and devoured the whole thing in one day.

    "text": "350 Liquors held a Bourbon Draw and tasting event at the Stables Event Center. Over 275 people showed up to enjoy dinner and a bourbon tasting.\nAt the end of the night, 350 Liquors presented a check for ten thousand dollars to Jay and Tamara House, who are the founders of Grant’s House.\nGrant’s House is a local nonprofit supporting children and young adults with special needs and disabilities.\nGrant's House is named after their son Grant House, who left a special legacy to everyone whose life he touched.\nWhen he passed away he left behind a legacy to touch people's lives, by having a place where everyone was welcome, and where everyone had a place to help make their dreams come true. His parents, who founded the organization, say the support for Grant's House has been awesome.\n“It's very emotional for us,” said Jay House, “to see those kids every day and to see the families that are supporting those kids as they arrive at Grant's House. It's awesome to turn around and find out that we have that much support in this community to support those people.”\nGrant's House opened its doors to the public in 2019, and since the beginning of the program has raised nearly 5 million dollars to help support kids with special needs. Jay and Tamara House say that they have grown Grant’s house to what it is today thanks to the people who live in Tippecanoe County.\nThe man who organized the event, BJ Kelley, has known the House family for many years. He said that with the money that was raised, he wanted to give back to the community and to Grant’s House.\n“He has always had a giant heart for kids and for our son,” said Tamara House, “he came to us and said I’m gonna do something and I’m gonna do it big, and tonight he did it big”.",

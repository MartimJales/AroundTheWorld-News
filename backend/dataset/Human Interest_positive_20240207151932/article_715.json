    "text": "LOWVILLE — Just before Christmas, Sen. Mark Walczyk inducted C. Lee Hinkleman Sr. into the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame during a ceremony at the American Legion Post 162.

Mr. Hinkleman held a variety of roles, including 331st General Hospital Personnel Staff Supervisor, Administrative Supervisor in the 368th Military Police Company, Barrigada, Guam, Human Resource Manager in the 70th Division in Fort Benning, Georgia, and as the 826th Military Intelligence Battalion Senior Intelligence Analyst.\nMr. Hinkleman earned numerous awards and commendations, including a Recruiter Ring, six Army Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals, six Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Service Medal, Non-commissioned Officer’s Professional Development Ribbon with numeral 3, Army Service Ribbon, Military Volunteer Components Overseas Training Ribbon, Expert Marksmanship Qualification Badge with rifle bar, U.S. Army Gold Recruiter Badge with three sapphire achievement stars, U.S. Army Basic Recruiter Badge with 1 gold achievement star, and two Overseas Service Ribbons.\nUpon leaving the military, he worked as the Liaison to the Oneida Indian Nation Land Claim for the Oneida County Executive.

In addition, he serves on the Board of Directors of the ARC Foundation (and as treasurer) and is co-chair of the Lowville Cream Cheese Festival.\nHe has a Facebook food blog, “Eating in Upstate New York and Beyond,” which has more than 20,000 followers. He also writes restaurant articles for the NNY Living magazine.\nMr. Hinkleman is the Legislative Chairman for the American Legion Department of New York and Vice Legislative Chairman at the national level. He currently serves as Commander of Post 162 in Lowville and Lewis County Commander.\nPrior to presenting Mr. Hinkleman the plaque recognizing his induction, Sen. Walczyk pointed out why Mr. Hinkleman was chosen for the honor.\n“This is a man who not only was a career military man and served honorably and fought for our nation for 22 years and sacrificed for our nation for 22 years but epitomizes what a veteran can do when they’re done with that service, continue to serve in their community and continue to add value to everyone that they come into contact with,” the senator said.\nMr. Hinkleman thanked Senator Walczyk and expressed his appreciation for the senator’s aid and support to all veterans.\n“Extremely humbled to be selected for this honor,” Mr. Hinkleman said.\nHe and his wife, Cathy, have three children and nine grandchildren.\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

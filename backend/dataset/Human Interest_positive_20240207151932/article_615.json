    "text": "Filipina expat triumphs over Dubai Marathon’s 42 km challenge – a birthday gift to herself\nThis news has been read 299 times!\nDUBAI, Jan 7: Jona Lei Jagonos found herself in a state of disbelief long after completing the Dubai Marathon’s grueling 42 km on Sunday. Overflowing with joy and a profound sense of relief, the Filipina expat and avid fitness enthusiast reflected on the surreal accomplishment.\nFor Jona, a passionate mountain biker and fitness aficionado, crossing the finish line was not just about conquering the challenging marathon but also a special gift to herself as she approached her 40th birthday. Recalling her journey, she shared, “I ran the 10 km at the Dubai Marathon last year, my first 10 km. I promised myself I would tackle the full marathon in 2024, especially with my 40th birthday approaching on February 3. I am thrilled to have fulfilled this promise and completed the race.”\nThe significance of finishing the 42 km run extended beyond a personal milestone; it served as a touching tribute to Jona’s greatest source of inspiration – her mother, Melchora Jagonos. Expressing her gratitude, Jona revealed, “Running the full marathon in Dubai was always on my bucket list. I am delighted that I could achieve this feat just one day after my mother’s 84th birthday.”\nDespite her mother’s initial worries about the marathon endeavor, Jona highlighted the support and concern, stating, “She was very worried when I told her about running 42 km. She thought I was crazy and asked why I was doing this. I believe she is happy and relieved now that I am fine. She’s always concerned because I am the baby in the family, the youngest of her six children.”\nBorn in Bato, Leyte, Philippines, Jona expressed her deep gratitude to her mother, emphasizing the immense mental strength she gained from her upbringing. “My friends at Dubai Marina supported me during my preparation for the Dubai Marathon, but an undertaking like this requires significant mental strength. I credit that strength to my mother,” said Jona, who moved to Dubai in 2007.\nReflecting on her mother’s resilience and strength, Jona concluded, “My mother raised the six of us after my father died when I was only six. She is my superhero—a strong woman who pushed through life’s barriers for us. The mental strength I possess, I owe it to her. She is the ‘supermum’ who never gave up!”\nThis news has been read 299 times!",

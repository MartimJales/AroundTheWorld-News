    "text": "There’s some good news coming out of Pittsburgh Pirates camp. After fracturing his left fibula in April of last season, Pirates shortstop Oneil Cruz, via interpreter Stephen Morales said he’s, “All good. 100% now. Everything’s like it’s supposed to be.” Cruz appeared to have no imitations with that left leg, also. The serious injury occurred when Cruz attempted to slide into home plate when he banged into Chicago White Sox catcher Seby Zavala. The play sparked a bench-clearing brawl at PNC Park and Cruz left the game. He also was ruled out of the regular season officially in September. The shortstop made strong progress during his rehabilitation process at the Pirates’ academy in the Dominican Republic which included some sliding drills. He mastered those rather seamlessly. Morales watched Cruz’s progress saying it was as if he were “riding a bike” through it. Cruz was promoted to the big-league club in June 2022 and had his 6-foot-7 frame that possessed the most power in the organization. The combination of his defensive and offensive skills made those following his minor-league career salivate. Additionally, he only looks to improve on those skills. It helped things with the team desperate for a shortstop. Cruz was signed by the Dodgers in 2015 and was acquired by the Pirates in 2017 in a trade for Tony Watson.

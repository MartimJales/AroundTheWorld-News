    "text": "Campaign is seeking £70,000 for a statue to the Navy's West Africa SquadronThe Squadron patrolled the Atlantic for slave ships between 1807 and 1867Robert Tombs believes a memorial would 'right the wrong of a long neglect'\nA long-overdue memorial to the Royal Navy’s contribution to ending the slave trade will help to tackle the ‘distortion’ of Britain’s past, a leading Cambridge historian says.\nProfessor Robert Tombs believes that building a sculpture to mark the contribution of the sailors of the West Africa Squadron would ‘right the wrong of a long neglect’.\nHe is the latest figure to support the appeal following its championing in Saturday’s Daily Mail by the Leader of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, and a £25,000 pledge yesterday by Lord Ashcroft.\nBetween 1807 and 1867, the squadron seized vessels bound for the Americas and freed more than 150,000 men, women and children destined for servitude there.\nAt its peak, its 36 ships, crewed by 4,000 men, were using up half of the Royal Navy’s budget – equivalent to as much as £50billion today.\nCampaigners are seeking to raise £70,000 for a permanent statue honouring the squadron in Portsmouth, which served as its base\nProfessor Robert Tombs believes that building a sculpture to mark the contribution of the sailors of the West Africa Squadron would ‘right the wrong of a long neglect’\nPortsmouth North MP Penny Mordaunt has come out strongly in support of the campaign\nAlthough many hundreds of sailors died, there is no memorial to their vital work, prompting local historians to propose one and commission a design for it.\nA model of the sculpture will be unveiled in Parliament this month by Ms Mordaunt.\nFlanked by a shackled woman and a freed slave with broken chains, the finished sculpture – to be sited in the squadron’s home base of Portsmouth – will be cast in bronze and mounted on a Portland stone plinth if the required £70,000 is raised.\nBacking the campaign, Professor Tombs, who is emeritus professor of French history at Cambridge University and a critic of ideologically driven misrepresentations of Britain’s past, told the Mail: ‘This memorial is long overdue. It rights the wrong of a long neglect. And in today’s climate, it helps to prevent the distortion of our history.’\nHe joins Lord Ashcroft, who told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Britain’s role in helping to abolish the slave trade has been forgotten. It’s something we should be proud of.’\nThe debate comes as schools and universities have removed the names of slave traders from their sites and the National Trust has drawn up a controversial list of 93 properties with links to slavery.\nPortsmouth North MP Ms Mordaunt wrote in Saturday’s Mail: ‘Yes, Britain had a role in the slave trade. Yes, people made money out of it. But let’s be clear about something. We ended it.’\nThe West Africa Squadron Memorial Fund was launched last year by Colin Kemp, 76, from Chichester, with a design from award-winning sculptor Vincent Gray. Excluding Lord Ashcroft’s pledge, the campaign has so far raised £6,300.\nIf you’d like to contribute towards the memorial, go to justgiving.com/ crowdfunding/WestAfricaSquadron",

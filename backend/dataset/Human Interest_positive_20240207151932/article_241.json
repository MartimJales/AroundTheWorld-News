In addition to its well-known uses for pain relief and its anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties, a recent study indicates that cancer patients who take low-dose aspirin daily experience a 21 percent reduction in mortality. Furthermore, there is evidence of aspirin’s role in preventing cancer metastasis.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of global mortality. In 2020 alone, there were approximately 19.3 million new cancer cases worldwide and nearly 10 million deaths. According to statistics, 1 in 6 reported deaths are attributed to cancer. The most common types of cancer include breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, and stomach.\nIn November 2023, researchers from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom published a comprehensive review in the British Journal of Cancer (BJC) outlining aspirin’s potential to reduce cancer mortality, prevent metastatic cancer spread, and minimize vascular complications. The review encompassed both favorable and unfavorable evidence, thoroughly analyzing the rationale behind using aspirin in cancer treatment.\nAspirin’s Impact on Cancer Mortality\nThe study compiled results from 118 observational studies involving approximately 1 million cancer patients. It revealed that daily intake of low-dose aspirin (75 or 81 milligrams) was associated with a 21 percent reduction in all-cause mortality.\n[Less than 50%]\n[\nlink to www.theepochtimes.com (secure)\n]\nPage\n1\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nRelated Threads\n1\nCannabis Compound May Stop Metastatic Breast Cancer\n12/03/07\n2\nMy Mom diagnosed with Metastatic Melanoma Cancer, Battling 3 Months, FenBen, Ivermectine, Methylene Blue, Turkey Tails, CBD, RSO, Red Light, ETC.\n07/29/23\n3\nDoctor friend is baffled, big increase in metastatic cancer in people in their 30's\n08/31/22\nDisclaimer / Copyright Info\n-\nPrivacy Policy\n-\nTerms Of Use\n-\nCancellation Policy / Billing Help\nMail\nWebmaster\nwith questions or comments about this site.\nCopyright © 1999 - 2023 Godlikeproductions.com\nPage generated in 0.024s (9 queries)",

    "text": "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers clinched their third straight 2023 NFC South title and with it earned another first-place schedule in 2024. The three games on Tampa Bay's 17-game schedule that were determined by matching division standing became home dates against the AFC North champion Baltimore Ravens and the NFC West-winning San Francisco 49ers, plus a trip to Detroit to play the Lions, who captured the NFC North title. That fleshes out a schedule that also includes the usual six intradivision games in the NFC South plus matchups with the four teams in the NFC East and the four teams in the AFC West. To be more specific, here are the opponents for the Bucs' 17 regular season games in 2024: HOME - Atlanta Falcons - Baltimore Ravens - Carolina Panthers - Denver Broncos - Las Vegas Raiders - New Orleans Saints - Philadelphia Eagles - San Francisco 49ers - Washington Commanders AWAY - Atlanta Falcons - Carolina Panthers - Dallas Cowboys - Detroit Lions - Kansas City Chiefs - Los Angeles Chargers - New Orleans Saints - New York Giants The Buccaneers play nine games at home in 2024 because it is the NFC's turn to host all of the \"17th games\" that were added to the schedule in 2021. Each year, that game is an interconference matchup for every team with the two conferences alternating from year to year as the home teams. The Bucs' 17th game is their matchup against the Ravens. The Bucs will play six games against teams that earned a spot in the 2023 postseason field: Baltimore, Philadelphia and San Francisco at home, Dallas, Detroit and Kansas City on the road.",

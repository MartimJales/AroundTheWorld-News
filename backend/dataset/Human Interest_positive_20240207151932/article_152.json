    "text": "Ariana Grande is preparing to release her first single in nearly three years.\nOn Sunday, January 7, the pop star announced her new song \"Yes, And?\" will drop this Friday. In her post, Ari uploaded an up-close photo of her face while rocking her signature red R.E.M Beauty lipstick. She shared the same image to her Instagram stories with the pre-save link, and reposted updates from her old Sweetener fan page. The announcement comes over a week after she revealed her plans to make a comeback in 2024.\n\"yes, and? â™¡ 1.12,\" she wrote in her caption.\nGrande has been teasing the arrival of her seventh album for the past few weeks. She recently gave fans a preview of the themes for her upcoming LP by sharing clues to her Instagram Stories like a video of her mom dancing and an image of her crying.\n\"The two moods of the album,\" she wrote in her IG Story, per the Daily Mail .\nThe single will arrive nearly three years after the deluxe version of her Positions album dropped. It includes six additional tracks including \"34+35\" (Remix) featuring Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat. After her previous album, Ariana Grande spent a lot of time away from music and the limelight in general. While filming for the theatrical version of Wicked , Grande reappeared in headlines after she divorced her ex Dalton Gomez. Not long afterward, Grande started dating her Wicked co-star Ethan Slater.\nLook out for Ariana Grande's new single arriving on January 12.",

    "text": "Katie Thurston’s Ex Makes Big Moves With New Girlfriend\nBachelorette alum Katie Thurston’s ex makes big moves with new girlfriend. What’s going on with the reality TV star? Keep reading for all the details.\nKatie Thurston’s Ex Makes Big Moves With New Girlfriend\nIt seems as though\nKatie Thurston’s Bachelorette exes have moved on from her. Blake Moynes is reportedly single, but had a flirtation with Rachel Recchia on their conservation trip that has fans ‘shipping them.\nThe two became close friends during Season 9 of Bachelor In Paradise.\nMeanwhile, Katie’s other ex, John Hersey, appears to be\ndating someone new. Bachelor Nation fans may recall Katie’s brief rebound relationship with John after ending her engagement to Blake.\nEven though John and his new lady have been dating for a short time, things could be on the fast track.\nA Reddit post claims to have seen the woman post on Facebook looking for a place to live in San Diego.\nIn the post, she says she’s planning to move from Hawaii and includes several snapshots of John Hersey in the posting.\nThe post received several comments cautioning against taking such a big move.\n- Saw him on the apps in Vancouver about 6 months ago this ago so this must be quite new\n- What really happened between him and Katie? They seemed so into each other and then it just ended.\n- Well, he’s about to blow up at her if he didn’t okay her publicly announcing them dating like this. Yikes.\n- Don’t move for some dude you haven’t been with long …. Especially when you already live in Hawaii!\n- I’m not trying to snark but I do think leaving Hawaii for a man is risky, and they haven’t been dating for long and aren’t living together. Based on this, she seems to be moving just for him. I hope he doesn’t burn her and treats her well.\n- Girl don’t leave Maui for a man\n- I don’t want to be a hater of this bachelor-adjacent girl but why do people giving you housing leads need 5 photos of you? Why do they need to know about your long distance relationship? Withholding my judgment on moving for him\nAs for Katie, she rang in the new year with a kiss from a mystery man.\nWhy Does She Looks Familiar?\nReddit users also commented on John Hersey having a type, noting that the woman\nlooks like Katie. However, some other users saw a resemblance to other reality stars.\n- She kind of looks like Katie\n- I literally thought that was Katie at first, he def has a type!\n- Omg she looks like such a mix of Ben Higgins WIFE with a little bit of Katie mixed in.\n- Also, any Duggar snarkers here? She looks JUST like\nKatey Duggarto me\nDo you think it’s a mistake for the woman to move to San Diego? Does John Hersey have a type?

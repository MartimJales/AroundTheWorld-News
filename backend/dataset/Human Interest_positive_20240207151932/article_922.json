    "text": "Colin Blackwell had two goals and an assist and Nikita Zaitsev and Jarred Tinordi each contributed two points as the Chicago Blackhawks edged the visiting Calgary Flames 4-3 on Sunday to snap a five-game losing streak. Goaltender Petr Mrazek made 28 saves for Chicago, which was outshot 31-20. Nazem Kadri scored twice for the Flames, who lost for the second time in as many days. Blackwell scored the game-winner at 14:37 of the third period, beating Calgary goaltender Daniel Vladar with a wrist shot from the slot. Kadri answered with a goal just 42 seconds later, but the Blackhawks held on, navigating a late Flames flurry on a 6-on-5. Mrazek was especially effective on a Calgary power play midway through the third. Both teams were 1-for-3 on the man advantage. Calgary took a 2-1 lead on an Andrew Mangiapane power-play goal 3:26 into the second period. Mangiapane was credited with the tally thanks to a fortunate bounce, as his would-be pass ricocheted off a Blackhawk and into the net. The Blackhawks responded with two goals over a 2:40 span to take the lead. Philipp Kurashev scored to tie the game at 2 at 12:09 of the second, gathering the puck after a pass intended for him bounced off a Calgary defender and then wristing it into the net. Zaitsev beat Vladar at 14:49 when his slap shot just outside the right circle glanced off a Flames’ skate and in. Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists for Calgary. Vladar made 16 saves. Chicago managed just five shots on goal in the first period but made one of them count, as Blackwell beat Vladar with a wrist shot from the left circle to open the scoring 4:32 into the game. Kadri tied the game for Calgary just under nine minutes later. With Mrazek drawn out of the crease, Kadri scored on a tip-in following a crisp back-door pass from Noah Hanifin. Injury-ravaged Chicago, which placed star rookie Connor Bedard (fractured jaw) and fellow forward Nick Foligno (fractured left finger) on injured reserve Saturday, saw forward Zach Sanford make his team debut. Center Rem Pitlick, acquired Saturday in a trade with Pittsburgh, also was set to join the team, but inclement weather delayed his arrival. –Field Level Media More must-reads:",

    "text": "Some New Yorkers celebrated Three Kings’ Day this Saturday: a Latin tradition based on the religious holiday in which three kings visited the manger in Bethlehem to give gifts to the baby Jesus.\nDozens of bakeries worked overtime to prepare the traditional Rosca de Reyes, the Mexican and Latin American version of the Roscón de Reyes baked in Spain, a pastry delicacy that contains a small representation of the baby Jesus.\nAs they explained to us at Don Paco López, the oldest Mexican bakery in\nNew York, the plastic doll also represents, for those who find it in their piece, the commitment to invite them to the tamales lunch on February 2.\n“A lot of people bought. The meaning could be basically to unite the family, we do it not to sell but so that the family can meet, share and decide to return to celebrate Candelaria, and eat tamales..”, explains Armando López, owner from the Don López bakery.\nThe holiday brings together children and adults around sweet bread accompanied by hot cocoa with a touch of cinnamon that you can now enjoy for the rest of the month in restaurants and Mexican establishments in the five boroughs.\nRELATED\nNEWS:\n2024-01-07 21:42:00\n#meaning #unite #family #Reyess #thread",

    "text": "On Cam's 40th birthday, Jules shared a beautiful message to Instagram, expressing her love for the Australian cricketer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a living, walking example of what a good human is,\" she wrote. \"Happy 40th birthday to my [@cammerchant](https://www.instagram.com/cammerchant/)‚Ä¶ they generally say life begins, or you come into your own when you hit 40 but you live life to the full every day and your awareness for who YOU truly are, your beliefs, and what you need to be the best version of yourself is like no other‚Ä¶\" To celebrate five years since first locking eyes with one another, Jules took to her Instagram to share a heartwarming tribute to her husband Cam. \"Five years ago today I met my husband, and we really did commit to all the words we shared that day,\" Jules wrote. \"I'd choose you in a thousand lifetimes, in any version of reality, I'd find you and I'd choose you @cammerchant. What an adventure we have been on together. I love you.\" \"Thankyou to #mafs for helping me find you this time üòâ,\" she added. Cameron then shared a beautiful tribute of his own to the \"love of his life.\" \"I want a person who comes into my life by accident, but stays on purpose ‚ù§Ô∏è,\" the father of one wrote. \"Cannot believe it's been five years since I met my best friend for the first time in @julesrobinson and got married sight unseen..\" \"Still feel it was one of the best days I've ever experienced...& never would you think that in some of these photos we've only known each other for a matter of hours..\" He then continued: \"So many ask if it was Love at First Sight? & we are both so open to agree that it was definitely Vibe at First Sight.. There was something special, kind, supportive & warm about our first connection & it‚Äôs only become stronger over these past 5 years & so very grateful for you, our experiences & support & love we have created for each other & our family üòç\" \"How open we both were & it‚Äôs incredible to think of what you can create when you throw yourself all in.. \"These 5 years have been special & can‚Äôt wait to share so many more with you.

They reaffirmed their relationship by renewing their wedding vows to each other while in NZ. Fans watched as Jules and Cam stayed true to one another throughout the filming. They delighted audiences when they exchanged the exciting L-word. And amongst all the drama, cheating scandals, and petty fights, Jules and Cam's love was a shining light. Their stint on MAFS finally came to an end with a dream proposal by Cam to Jules, where he asked the Sydney makeup artist to marry him - for real!

The pair went on to host the most fabulous engagement party in April 2019. They celebrated with friends and family outside of the show, proving that their love was definitely for real. \"I had an engagement party tonight and I danced like no one was watching!!\" Jules said of the lavish party that took place at Acre Eatery, Sydney. At the MAFS reunion ‚Äî which was filmed in January 2019‚Äî the couple revealed they planned on marrying on the anniversary of the day they met. But their plans changed earlier in September. \"We had this great idea to get married on the one-year anniversary, and it was just a lovely, romantic gesture,\" [Jules said on the Today show](https://www.newidea.com.au/married-at-first-sight-cameron-merchant-jules-robinson-postpone-wedding) recently. \"But so much has been happening and going on, and I wanted to enjoy the process of organising the wedding, so that's the only reason why it's been postponed.\" The pair then announced the revised date for their wedding - Tuesday, November 19th, 2019.

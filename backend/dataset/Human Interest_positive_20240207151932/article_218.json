    "text": "- Some of Britain's biggest stores are set to publish holiday trading figures. - Marks & Spencer is set to have a great Christmas - Supermarket giants are also expected to perform strongly The high street's winners and losers will be revealed this week as some of the UK's biggest stores publish festive trading figures. As The Mail on Sunday revealed, M&S is likely to have a great Christmas and will update investors on Thursday. Supermarket giants are also expected to perform strongly with Sainsbury's and Tesco due to release figures on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. But others may have fared less well. While Next published strong figures last week, JD Sports was forced to slash its profit expectations in an unexpected twist. The 'King of Trainers' admitted it no longer expects to reach its target of £1bn annual profits despite bosses' confidence last year. Demand from buyers was weaker than anticipated, 'reflecting more cautious consumer spending.' Winner: In the festive supermarket battle, Britain's biggest grocer and its number two – Tesco and Sainsbury's – are expected to come out on top But Lord Wolfson-run Next saw its shares surge after raising profit expectations for the fifth time since June amid better-than-expected sales. Data from retail specialist Kantar, seen by The Mail on Sunday, shows that in the four weeks to Christmas Eve, grocery sales at M&S rose 14.2 per cent compared with last year. Analysts expect the company to post sales growth in its food and clothing and household divisions. Shares ended 2019 at their highest level since 2023 after the retailer returned to the FTSE 100 in September. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said that in the festive supermarket battle, the UK's biggest grocer and its number two – Tesco and Sainsbury's – are expected to come out on top.

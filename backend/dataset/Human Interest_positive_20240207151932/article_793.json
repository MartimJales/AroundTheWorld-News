    "text": "Dia de Reyes celebrated at San Juan basilica Jose Luis Marroquin celebrates Three Kings Day — or Dia de Reyes — every year. He kicks off the holiday by traveling from his home in Monterrey, located in the Mexican state of Nuevo León, to the Basilica of Our Lady of San Juan del Valle. Father Jorge Gomez says he’s seeing more people like Marroquin come to the Basilica for the holidays. “It’s also representing what the Magi were,” Gomez said. The Magi — or the Three Kings — were from the countries of Persia, India and Arabia. “And they were walking together,\" Gomez said. “So when you mention people coming from Mexico and Winter Texans from up north in Canada, and people from the Valley, we all come from different backgrounds, but we all have a goal in common: We want to see the face of God.” Father Gomez says there are ways we can apply the meaning of Three Kings Day to our lives. The Three Magi followed the star to find baby Jesus, and encountered King Heron along the way, who wanted to kill Jesus. “In our lives we find our little or big Herods, people who have envy,” Gomez said. “So my advice is being aware of those Herods in your lives through prayer and knowing and identifying them. Just leave them, keep moving with your eyes in heaven and your feet on earth.” Watch the video above for the full story More News News Video - 92nd annual Texas Citrus Fiesta kicks off in Mission with month-long events - Man arrested in Cameron County for jumping on roofs of homes - Capital murder trial for man accused of killing DPS trooper underway - Edinburg police: Loose Emu dies after being captured - Monday, Jan. 8, 2024: Windy, very warm, temps in the 80s",

    "text": "Watch the full interview now as a VladTV Youtube Member: [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/vladtv/join) Part 1: [Boosie on Saying VladTV Pays Him $500K a Year, Got Nervous Meeting Chloe Bailey](https://www.vladtv.com/article/302304/boosie-on-saying-vladtv-pays-him-500k-a-year-got-nervous-meeting-chloe) Boosie opened up about receiving financial help during difficult periods, particularly during his time in jail and thereafter. Amidst the hardships, he revealed giving $20,000 to his mother for his protection and has expressed gratitude towards those who supported him. He also shared a touching story of comedian Katt Williams's generosity. Upon coming out of prison, Boosie attended one of Williams's shows, where he was treated \"like a king\" and unexpectedly received a bundled $15,000. Williams is known for his legendary giving, as mentioned by interviewer Vlad, often handing out large sums of money to people in need or even strangers. For Boosie, this act of kindness was a significant boost that helped him get back on his feet, following the loss of his home and other assets while incarcerated.",

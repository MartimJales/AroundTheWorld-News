    "text": "BREWSTER, N.Y. -- The Enoch Crosby Chapter of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution celebrated the holiday season with a luncheon, complete with a gift drive and a Yankee Swap at the Brewster VFW, along with its regular meeting. More than two dozen gifts were wrapped and donated to two Carmel families in need. Members were enthusiastic about supporting the community in this way and brightening the holidays for children who otherwise would not receive gifts due to difficult circumstances. In addition, chapter members participated in an annual gift card collection to support the Putnam/Northern Westchester Women’s Resource Center. Three new members were inducted: Meghan Reilly, Betty Spano, and Donna O’Creene Kern. Meghan Reilly and her sister Morgan are descendants of Solomon Hopkins, who served in the 7th Regiment of the Dutchess County Militia. A historic marker on Route 301 states that he would leave an upstairs window unlocked for his brother-in-law, Patriot Spy Enoch Crosby to come and go as needed. Betty Spano has found many familiar local names in her family tree including Adams, Tompkins, Smalley, Barrett, and Bennett through research over the last few years. Dawn O’Creene Kern, a newlywed, and new to genealogy research as well, appreciated the assistance of Libby Baker, Chapter Registrar. Holly O’Connor, membership chair and corresponding secretary, and Adrienne Davies, chapter chaplain, conducted the induction ceremony, introduced the new members and presented them with gifts and information to encourage their future participation. The chapter also honored Alexandra Johnson for her 60 years of membership. Her friendship is cherished and her service is greatly appreciated. Mrs. Johnson was inducted at the age of 18 in Brewster, with her mother, Mabel Holmes Addis and her aunt Marjorie Lobdell Addis, in attendance. Her grandmother, Esther Lobdell Addis was a founding member of the Enoch Crosby Chapter. Mrs. Johnson states that she enjoys the congenial camaraderie of the chapter and is continuing to research supplemental ancestors who participated in the American Revolution. Meetings in 2024 will be held on the second Saturday of each month at various locations around Putnam County, starting in February. Any woman 18 years or older, regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background, who can prove lineal descent from a patriot of the American Revolution is eligible to join. For more information or assistance with membership, please contact Regent Joan Hay at jehjbh@hotmail.com or Registrar Libby Baker at libbybaker@aol.com .

    "text": "SriLankan Aviation College, a university affiliated to the International Aviation Association, is the premier institution in Sri Lanka that conducts courses in the field of aviation sector according to global standards.\nIn addition to pilot, aircraft engineer, technician, cabin crew, ground operations, air cargo handling courses, the Aviation College conducts about 10 courses related to the aviation sector.\nIn addition to these courses, the SriLankan Aviation College conducts training for about 3,000 employees of SriLankan Airlines.\nAfter five years, the SriLankan Aviation College awarded the graduation certificates to 450 students who studied the degree and diploma courses related to the aviation sector recently at the Colombo Nelum Pokuna Theatre.\nPorts, Shipping and Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was the Chief and Minister of State for Higher Education Surendra Raghavan and SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ashok Pathirage also participated.\nMinister de Silva said: “Sri Lanka is a small country in the Indian Ocean. Our country has only one airline. But the aviation graduates produced by the aviation college owned by the airline company are graduates with higher knowledge than the graduates of other countries of the world. Therefore, it is a great pride for our country that SriLankan Airlines maintains such an aviation college.\n“The entire world’s airline industry collapsed due to the COVID crisis. Flights came to a halt completely. Aircrafts had to be parked at airports. The production of aircrafts stopped due to this and there was a big vacuum in the aviation industry. The same situation still exists in the aviation industry, and it has greatly affected to Sri Lanka to get out of that situation. First of all, we need to strengthen the economy of our country, and the current Government is working on it. Therefore, I am thankful to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his efforts to bring the country’s economy to a stable state.”",

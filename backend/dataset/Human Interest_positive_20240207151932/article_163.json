    "text": "Meralco Bolts’ Shonn Miller in his PBA debut. –PBA IMAGES\nMeralco dismantled Magnolia on the road on Saturday night for a key Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) Commissioner’s Cup victory that, according to coach Luigi Trillo, gave the Bolts something more than a win reflected in the standings.\nAside from a win that pushed the Bolts to 7-2 and kept the club in the hunt for the much-coveted playoff protection, Trillo was thrilled to see a full-strength Bolts roster and their new import impress with a pair of games to go.\nADVERTISEMENT “Guys are back, Shonn Miller, and we still have games coming in,” the Meralco coach told the Inquirer on Sunday afternoon, fresh off a return flight from Iloilo City where the Bolts stifled Magnolia, 85-80, at a packed University of San Agustin Gym.\nFEATURED STORIES SPORTS Time for step two for Gilas Pilipinas SPORTS PVL: Creamline coach sees ‘easy’ transition for veteran stars SPORTS PBA: Ginebra stays in twice-to-beat hunt with win over NorthPort Miller, who replaced high-scoring guard Zach Lofton, delivered 33 points and 22 rebounds while preserving the fourth-quarter heroics of hometown hero Anjo Caram, whose presence completed the Bolts for the first time this season-opening conference.\n“We took Magnolia out of its strengths,” Trillo said. “But really, the revelation was the impact Shonn had,” Trillo said.\n“Out of town, in a hot gym, and playing against the best defensive team? The No. 1 rebounding team? It was nice to see Shonn come in and play in that win.”\nDoing a quick math during the chat, Trillo said the only way Meralco can tab a twice-to-beat bonus is for his charges to sweep dangerous Phoenix Super LPG and desperate Terrafirma.\nOne error would put Meralco in a perilous spot as San Miguel and defending champion Barangay Ginebra both hold superior quotients over them. A win by the two powerhouses would cause great complications for the Bolts.\nAmid the other grim scenarios, Trillo is taking each day in stride.\n“These [next] games will also get guys back into the groove of things with playoff basketball upon us now,” he said.

While they stayed mum on their expanding family, Bailey previously opened up about her blossoming relationship with DDG, telling British Vogue in a 2022 interview that “experiencing deep love for the first time in my life is something I feel has opened a whole new world for me creatively.” “I like all of the scary feelings that come with that. I like the suspense, the not knowing what’s going to happen, and I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to be going through in womanhood,” she added. This is Bailey and DDG’s first child together.",

Don’t cut all the way through the dough, this is just to make a visible mark.\nStep 3\nCut an inch outside of the line you drew with the knife. This area will be the dough crust. Remove the access dough to save for later.\nStep 4\nShape the pizza to be a heart. Use the extra dough for added areas of crust where you need it.\nFor fun, shape some small hearts out of the extra dough.

    "text": "EAU CLAIRE — The Correctional Facility Financial Education program, created by Royal Credit Union, was recognized both state-wide and nationally with two awards that recognize the program’s commitment to financial literacy. Named after the credit union pioneer Alphonse Desjardins, the Desjardins Adult Financial Education Award highlights the credit union industry’s commitment to financial education for all ages. Royal’s CFFE program received both a first place award from the Wisconsin Credit Union League and a third place award at the national level from the Credit Union National Association, or CUNA, for their work in 2023. This is the first time that Royal has received an award for this program since it began back in 2015. The awards will be presented at a virtual reception hosted by CUNA on Jan. 23, 2024. “Royal is incredibly honored to have received Desjardins Awards on both the state and national levels recognizing the continued growth and success of our correctional facility financial education program,” said Brandon Riechers, Royal president and CEO. “The program is designed to help individuals achieve financial well-being and supports our core purpose which is to create a positive impact in the lives we touch. We are proud to have provided financial education to 3,000 people in the care of area correctional facilities and hope our program provides them with the tools they need to accomplish their financial goals.” Melissa Janssen, program director of Community Relations at Royal, said the program entails two to three 90-minute sessions that are offered both in-person and virtually to provide financial education, tools and resources for correctional facilities. Each program is personalized to meet the needs of their correctional facility, and Janssen said they cover all four elements of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Financial Well-Being Scale: control, capacity, choice and goal. “The gentlemen who attend the presentation gain knowledge in budgeting and paying off debt, which helps them once released,” said Heather Ryan, treatment specialist II and PREA victim service coordinator at Chippewa Valley Correctional Treatment Facility. “Dealing with finances is stressful for many people, and this encourages them to consider the potential challenges and opportunities prior to release. They do this by practicing to make a budget and participating in several other activities so they can plan and be prepared for what’s ahead.” As this program has been providing this service since October of 2015, Janssen said it first began at the Eau Claire County Jail as a partnership with a local non-profit organization, Literacy Chippewa Valley. “At the time, Literacy Chippewa Valley was already offering a variety of educational programs in the jail and asked if Royal would be interested in joining their efforts by providing financial literacy training,” she said. “Royal’s Community Financial Education Coordinator developed a curriculum focused on important money management topics like understanding spending habits, creating a budget, dealing with debit, and building credit. This curriculum was well-received by students.” After its initial success, Janssen said it was clear that this program could be replicated in other correctional facilities. By September of 2016, they had managed to create a program which was entirely run by Royal and led by Member Account Representatives from their Rice Lake office at the Barron County Jail. CFFE is now offered in four prisons, six jails and one juvenile detention center across Wisconsin and Minnesota. The success of their program even allowed Royal to partner with the University of Wisconsin-Stout’s Applied Research Center to measure its effectiveness. The results showed significant gains in attitudes and confidence levels regarding financial literacy,” said Janssen. “Royal used these findings to publish a whitepaper with the National Credit Union Foundation to help other credit unions create their own correctional facility financial education programs.” The whitepaper can be found on Royal Credit Union’s website, at rcu.org/CorrectionalEducation . With the Desjardin Awards as one of the highest honors in the credit union industry, Janssen and Royal Credit Union are honored to have received this recognition. “Receiving these awards is a testament to the positive impact Royal’s CFFE program is making in the communities they serve and their ongoing commitment to promoting financial well-being for all,” said Janssen. “Justice-involved individuals are an underserved population that often struggle to receive access to legitimate financial services and educational support.” Subscribe to the Leader Telegram",

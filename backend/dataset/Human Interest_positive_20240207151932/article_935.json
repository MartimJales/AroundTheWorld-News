    "text": "Two peope were rescued from a Louisville house fire with one of the rescues being made by a former firefighter who was in the right place at the right time. Jacolby Barnes, who was a firefighter in Shelby County until three years ago, was coming home with his mother when he saw smoke coming from the house on Beargrass Avenue around 4 p.m. He grabbed his old turnout gear and went into rescue mode. \"We heard her talking so I busted out the AC unit, and then helped her get out the window, and busted out the rest of the windows,\" Barnes told [WHAS11.com](https://www.whas11.com/article/news/local/1-person-critical-condition-another-rescued-fire-louisville-kentucky/417-f3b13f44-1773-4345-bc57-ff7a091fdf07). Firefighters from Fern Creek, Jeffersontown, Louisville and Okolona responded and rescued a woman who was trapped, the station reported. Fern Creek Fire & EMS Assistant Chief Dewayne Hutchens said one person was in critical condition and the one Barnes rescued was uninjured. Firefighters had the fire under control in a half-hour but the home sustained significant damage. Barnes said he was interested in re-joining the fire department.",

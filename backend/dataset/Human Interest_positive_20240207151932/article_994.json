    "text": "Pumpkin Morning Glory Muffins are healthy, hearty, and so delicious! Loaded with shredded carrots and apples, theyâ€™re so moist! And dried cranberries, warm spices, and crunchy pecans make them extra delicious!\nPumpkin Morning Glory Muffin Recipe\nWhenever pumpkin goes on sale I stock up like a crazy lady. Itâ€™s a little obnoxious, but what can I say? I love a good bargain! And as a professional baking blogger, it just makes sense. One can really never have too much pumpkin! Especially in October. Last week I hit the jackpot and found organic pumpkin on sale for 75 centsâ€¦\nI bought 20 cans. #noselfcontrol\nSo far Iâ€™ve made pumpkin pie, pumpkin cake (recipe coming soon), and pumpkin morning glory muffins. Actually, Iâ€™ve made these muffins twice! In 12 days. And I live alone. Theyâ€™re really that good. Especially with a hot cup of coffee or tea. Actually eating one right now and my key board is a bit of a mess! So many delicious crumbs everywhere.\nTips and Tricks for Recipe Success:\n- These pumpkin morning glory muffins are infinitely adaptable! Canâ€™t find coconut oil? Try using canola oil, or a very mild olive oil. Not a fan of pecans? Use almonds, walnuts, or pistachios instead. No brown sugar in the pantry? Granulated sugar or coconut sugar will work in a pinch! Not crazy about cranberries? Toss in dried cherries or raisins for a tasty swap. You get the picture ðŸ˜‰\n- Unless you have a serious aversion to carrot/apple peels, thereâ€™s no need to take the extra step of peeling them. These muffins are delightfully rustic so peels and skins are more than welcome!\n- Be sure your muffins are fully baked before removing them from the oven. My muffins were perfectly done at 27 minutes. These muffins are extremely moist, so they need a little more time in the oven than most muffin recipes.\nHave a wonderful Halloween weekend! Are you dressing up? Going to any fun parties? Itâ€™s a work weekend for me, but Iâ€™ll be celebrating in spirit. See you tomorrow with PIE.\nMore Muffin Recipes:\nMy Favorite Morning Glory Muffins Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins and Bread Glazed Pumpkin Donut Muffins (Vegan)\nIf you try this recipe, let me know!

Seeing your kitchen creations makes my day. â™¥\nPumpkin Morning Glory Muffins\nIngredients\n- 1 and 1/2 cups whole wheat flour\n- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n- 3/4 cup light brown sugar, packed\n- 1 tablespoon baking powder\n- 2 teaspoons baking soda\n- 2 teaspoons pumpkin spice\n- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 3/4 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)\n- 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce\n- 1/2 cup coconut oil, melted\n- 1 large apple, shredded\n- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n- 2 cups grated carrot (about 3 medium)\n- 1/2 cup dried cranberries\n- 1/2 cup flaked coconut\n- 1/2 cup pecans, chopped\nInstructions\n- Line a 12 mold muffin tin with paper liners, set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees (F).\n- In medium bowl add the flours, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin spice, cinnamon, and salt; whisk well to combine, set aside. In a large bowl add the pumpkin, applesauce, coconut oil, grated apple, vanilla, and carrots; whisk to combine. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and stir until just combined. Fold in the cranberries, coconut and pecans; stir until just combined. Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups.\n- Bake for 24 to 28 minutes minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (or with just a few crumbs attached). Cool muffins in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.\n@Bakerbynatureand by using the hashtag #BakerByNature",

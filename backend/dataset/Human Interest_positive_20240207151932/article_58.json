    "text": "Payment processor Mastercard is favored by many investors, including Warren Buffett. Its stock went up nearly 23% in 2023, and it reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14% in the third quarter, with earnings soaring 28%. Advertisement Mastercard enjoys multiple moats protecting its business; these include its well-known brand and switching costs associated with moving to rival payment-processing networks. Another factor working in the company’s favor is its purposeful avoidance of lending. While becoming a lender would allow Mastercard to generate interest and fee income along with merchant fees, that would also expose the company to potential loan losses and credit delinquencies. Since it doesn’t lend, it can bounce back from downturns quicker than other financial institutions.\nAdvertisement Mastercard has cemented itself as the United States’ No. 2 credit card network by purchase volume (after Visa), and it should be able to keep its momentum going domestically over the long run. The shift from cash to digital payments will continue, and e-commerce will grow. Furthermore, Mastercard has a sizable opportunity abroad, as the middle classes in emerging markets expand. Over the coming decades, the company can also extend its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

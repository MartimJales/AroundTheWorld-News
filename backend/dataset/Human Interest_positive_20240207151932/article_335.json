    "text": "Take that, London! The [Buffalo Bills](https://www.buffalorumblings.com/) have officially clinched a playoff spot, thanks to the [Tennessee Titans](https://www.musiccitymiracles.com/) having knocked off the [Jacksonville Jaguars](https://www.bigcatcountry.com/) in Week 18. The Jaguars did everything they could to lose in Week 18, and the Titans served up a healthy bit of humble pie. Regardless of tonight’s outcome in South Florida, the Bills are guaranteed to at least enter the playoffs no worse than the seven seed. But backing into the postseason isn’t the preferred road, and it isn’t their only option of course with a much better outcome still on the table. Tonight’s AFC East showdown against the [Miami Dolphins](https://www.thephinsider.com/) will have both teams vying for divisional supremacy and the two seed in the AFC. For Buffalo, a win in Miami would allow them to claim their fourth-consecutive AFC East Divisional title. By winning, the Bills would then host the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/) next weekend for NFL Super Wild Card Weekend. If the Bills do fall to the Dolphins this evening, they would lose the two seed in the playoffs but, again, having clinched the seven seed, they’d find themselves back down in often-sunny Florida next week for the Wild Card round. Interesting note: The Jaguars losing means that every AFC opponent to defeat the Buffalo Bills this season failed to make the playoffs.",

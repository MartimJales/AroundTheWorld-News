    "text": "Wintersköl returns with old traditions and new offerings If you are missing the fun and activity of the holidays there is no need to fret, Aspen’s 73rd annual Wintersköl returns on Thursday through Sunday with four days of events and celebrations. Created by the late Aspen Hall of Famer Jack dePagter in 1951, Wintersköl was born out of residents’ desire to fill the post-holiday lull with excitement and celebration while showcasing their unique Aspen lifestyle. In the past 73 years, it has evolved into an annual winter tradition. This year’s slogan is “Uniting Ski Bums and Bunnies,” and brings back popular events alongside new additions. “Winterskol is a beloved tradition that celebrates our unique Nordic lifestyle. The slogan is a nod to the ski slopes being one of the great unifiers in this town. Everyone loves a powder day,” said Julie Hardman, ACRA Senior Director of Events. “In its 73rd year, Winterskol continues to be a locally serving but destination-worthy event. This year we are excited to add the beer festival in addition to Soupsköl and we are pleased to sponsor the Buttermilk Uphill and the Drag Bingo Brunch.” Festivities unofficially kick off on Wednesday with the Apple Strudel Downhill at Aspen Highlands. The tradition originated soon after local legend and former proprietor of Gretl’s Tourtellotte Restaurant (now Bonnie’s) Gretl Uhl began making apple strudel at the Merry Go Round restaurant in 1988. To participate, follow the signs from the top of Exhibition Lift, past the Merry Go Round Restaurant to the top of Apple Strudel Run to enter the race. Run the course, then partake in strudel and hot chocolate at the finish line. No pre-registration is necessary. On Thursday, the Aspen Chamber Resort Association (ACRA) hosts the Helen K. Klanderud Wintersköl Awards and luncheon at the St. Regis. Klanderlud was elected to the Pitkin County Board of County Commissioners in 1980, making her the first woman to serve as a county commissioner. Subsequently, she served as the Mayor of Aspen from 2001-2007. Thursday also features live ice and snow sculpture carving by local Colorado artist Thomas Barlow in Wagner Park, and a preview of DanceAspen’s “Cloudline,” a creation of choreographer Robyn Mineko Williams, at the Rooftop Café on the top floor of the Aspen Art Museum. Both are free and open to the public. On Friday morning the Uphill Breakfast Club leads the way atop Buttermilk Mountain. The weekly tradition brings together uphill skiers and hikers for a hearty breakfast at The Cliffhouse. ValleyOrtho and ACRA will be offering free breakfast for all participants along with prize giveaways to celebrate Wintersköl. Other Friday events include the World Pro Ski Tour qualifications on Aspen Mountain, live music by local music collective 432One at Wagner Park, and the Aspen Valley Ski & Snowboard Club (AVSC) Rail Jam for skiers and snowboarders. This event is for all ages and will include music and prizes. Saturday kicks off with the World Pro Ski Tour Dual Super Slalom #1, Men’s Round 32, Men’s Round 16 to the finals, and Women’s Round 16 to the finals featuring Olympians, World Cup, and NCAA racers on Aspen Mountain. The afternoon brings the new Wintersköl Beer Festival at Wagner Park. The “Toast of Winter” Beer Festival will bring a selection of Colorado breweries, wineries, and distilleries for tastings, live music, food, and retail to Wagner Park and is in conjunction with the popular Soupsköl. Soupsköl was founded by local chef Reggie Barbour from Boogie’s Diner in 2004. He died in 2008, but the tradition carried on in various forms on and off until the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022 the beloved event returned to downtown Aspen. The tradition sees restaurants from across the Roaring Fork Valley come together to compete for the best soup and the first place “copper kettle.” Locals and visitors enjoy two hours of free soup tastings and then vote for their favorites. Last year, The Gant’s Pepperjack’s Cafe took the prize with a creamy tomato soup and mini grilled cheese, while Hominy in El Jebel earned second place with a Bayou Gumbo and Big Hoss Grill of Snowmass came in third with a clam chowder. The day ends with a family-friendly bonfire in Wagner Park and the Torchlight Parade and fireworks display on Aspen Mountain. The event will have a first come, first serve sign-up at the base of Nell Chair starting at 6:30 p.m. with the lift uploading from 7:30-7:45 p.m. Adults will be given flares to carry for the ski down, and kids have glowstick options. The parade, led by an Aspen Snowmass Ski Pro, will begin at 8 p.m. The fireworks display will immediately follow once skiers are off the hill. Event organizers suggest that participants wear clothing that they don’t mind getting burn marks from flares. Sunday Wintersköl overlaps with the kick-off of Aspen Gay Ski Week at Drag Bingo Brunch in the Grand Salon of The Little Nell. The Aspen Gay Ski Week (AGSW) and Wintersköl crossover brunch with Drag Queen Bingo, hosted by Ms. Mariam T. Brunch, will include morning eats and options of prosecco, mimosas, and Bloody Marys. This is a ticketed fundraising event presented by AGSW, The Little Nell, and ACRA to benefit the non-profit AspenOUT.

Sunday includes the World Pro Ski Tour Dual Super Slalom #2, Men’s Round 32, Men’s Round 16 to the finals, Women’s Round 16 to the finals, and a partnership free screening with Aspen Film of the animated film “Abominable” at the ISIS Theatre.

The Wintersköl Committee also announced this year’s community-nominated [Wintersköl Royalty](https://aspenchamber.org/events/winterskol/winterskol-royalty), Wendy Mitchell and Kaleb Cook. Mitchell is the former owner of local favorites Meat & Cheese Restaurant Farm Shop and Hooch Craft Cocktail Bar, which she sold to local restaurant group Infinite Hospitality so she could enjoy retirement.

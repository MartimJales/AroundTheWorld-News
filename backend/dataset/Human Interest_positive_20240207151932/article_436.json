    "text": "[PulteGroup](https://www.pulte.com/homes/texas/austin/georgetown/wolf-ranch-211180?cmp=BPS-_-GO-_-CTX-_-AUS-_-PUL-_-NA-_-ASM-_-NA-_-&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA-P-rBhBEEiwAQEXhH0WJbxaLsM-RDR07nEh0Mjlj4PfyyiMy5b2SFX7xJFuj64mjB6Yu-xoC2Z0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), a home construction company, has purchased limited home sites in the prestigious community and offers unbeatable pricing. Vice President of Sales Ashley Ellis said the Wolf Ranch community is sought after and highly regarded in Georgetown. “It’s really exciting for us to be able to offer a move-up buyer a home in the $400,000s in such an amazing community,” Ellis said. Lifestyle and community-building programs Ellis said PulteGroup is one of seven hand picked builders in the Wolf Ranch neighborhood. The community is known for its award-winning lifestyle program and boasts its own lifestyle director. Wolf Ranch’s reputation for community building has drawn interest in many buyers, from individuals with spouses, to young families. “Wolf Ranch excels at cultivating and fostering close knit communities that appeal to the diverse makeup of the residents. Activities and interest groups are led by both the lifestyle director and by the residents: from family movie nights to happy hour with live music and food trucks to book clubs and run groups, there is truly something for everyone.\" PulteGroup homesites In addition to a diverse community, buyers will also find diverse floor plans, each offering something different for clients. Ellis said PulteGroup offers plans from 1,800 square feet up to 2,700 square feet. One of the most notable floor plans is PulteGroup’s newest model, the Amherst, only available in Wolf Ranch. “One of the most exciting things about our Amherst plan is it has beautiful vaulted ceilings,” Ellis said. “It feels very prestigious, just like the community, so I would highly recommend going to see it.” PulteGroup has 42 homesites available that are going quickly.

For buyers who are interested in purchasing a home, Ellis said now is the perfect time to act, especially because interest rates are up, which means home prices are down. The opportunity to move into a brand new home in the $400,000s in this type of community is not something you want to miss. We have a multitude of financing options that help our buyer achieve a monthly payment they can afford today until rates drop and they can refinance. Development and location information Wolf Ranch is still in its development phase, but already has two amenity centers, as well as an onsite elementary school that is within walking distance: [Wolf Ranch Elementary School](https://www.georgetownisd.org/wolfranch). “It feels like you're in an established community, but it still has a lot of life,” Ellis said. “It’s really good for the value of your home, because if people are continuing to build, that value is just going to keep going up.” Georgetown is one of the fastest growing cities in the nation, and prospective clients will have plenty of shopping, dining and entertainment options nearby. Ellis said homeowners get the best of both worlds in the Wolf Ranch community because they have proximity to the interstate while still being tucked away in the hill country. The neighborhood has it all; the beauty of the hill country with resort-style amenities and nature trails and the convenience of being just minutes from Wolf Ranch shopping center and a brand new H-E-B.

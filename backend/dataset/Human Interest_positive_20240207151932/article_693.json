    "text": "2024-01-08 01:14:18 This is also the magic of the Coupe de France. After PSG’s demonstration against Revel (0-9) on the Castres pitch, the Parisians were very accessible with their opponents in the evening, after celebrating their qualification for the round of 16. Which resulted in some very beautiful images, such as the traditional exchange of jerseys, but also sincere discussions. Filmed by BeIn Sports cameras, the exchange in Spanish between the two coaches, Luis Enrique and Nicolas Giné, is the perfect example. “I’m a fan of yours,” begins the Revelois coach to challenge the Parisian technician. All with a smile, the Haut-Garonne technician told Luis Enrique that he had family between Perpignan and Barcelona to explain his ability with the Spanish language, before making the Parisian coach laugh with a funny anecdote: “I was at the Remontada! » “I really like you as a coach. (…) I wanted to give a good image of the club”, can we still hear from the mouth of Nicolas Giné facing a sincere Luis Enrique. “Above all, I told him that he was the right man for Paris” The Spanish coach also sent him some congratulations. “I congratulated him on the match they had,” Luis Enrique said before leaving Castres. They had a very serious match, I wish them a lot of success. I know they are first in their league and I hope they finish first at the end of the season. They had a very serious match. They played well, defended well. I think it will be a very good memory for them.” Nicolas Giné returned this encouragement. “Above all, I told him that he was the right man for Paris, for this game project,” the US Revel coach told BeIn Sports. He knows where he’s going. It may not be in the coming months… But I am convinced that he is the right person for this club. » Obviously, he did not hold it against the rigorous tactical organization put in place this Sunday, which earned him a nice spanking! #Coupe #France #Remontada #secrets #Revel #coach #Luis #Enrique",

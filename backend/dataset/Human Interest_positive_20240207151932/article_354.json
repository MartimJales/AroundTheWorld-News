    "text": "We're officially in the New Year, but we have to admit that mentally we're not ready for the cozy holiday season to end. That magical, restful time between December 25 and January 1 passes too quickly. Luckily, HGTV star [Erin Napier](https://www.countryliving.com/life/a45576520/home-town-star-erin-napier-best-seller/) took a moment to chronicle some special moments from her family's holiday, so we can reflect back on that cozy time. It is undoubtedly a busy time for Erin and [Ben Napier](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a45735348/hgtv-ben-napier-home-town-season-8-new-character/), as their popular [Home Town show](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a46054695/ben-erin-napier-home-town-season-7-interview/) returns to HGTV for its [seventh season](https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a45850766/ben-erin-napiers-home-town-hgtv-return/) on January 7. But, judging by the photos Erin [shared on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1abnIcpI0V), the parents of two young girls know how to embrace their downtime as a family. Erin's post included photos of her Christmas decorations, kids' toys on the kitchen counter, a handmade gingerbread house, and daughters Helen (who just turned 6!) and Mae (2) playing by the tree. Fans were quick to praise her for keeping it real on social media, as usual. They left comments like, \"I love to see a home that’s LIVED IN. ❤️ Thank you for sharing these shots,\" \"Absolutely my favorite time of the holidays!!! It’s peaceful and messy and perfect,\" and \"It’s all about the perfectly imperfect gingerbread house under the dome for me.❤️\" Of course, this is the spirit of Erin's best-selling book, [Heirloom Rooms](https://www.amazon.com/Heirloom-Rooms-Soulful-Stories-Home/dp/1982190434/ref=sr_1_1), which showcases the \"beautifully imperfect, lived-in spaces\" of Erin and her loved ones. To see more of Erin's style, tune in to Home Town on Sunday at 8 p.m. EST/7 p.m. CST on HGTV or stream episodes on [Max](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525072&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F). Katie Bowlby is Digital Director at Country Living, where she covers gift guides, product reviews, crafts, and TV shows like Yellowstone. She’s currently stitching up a cross-stitch pattern for the magazine’s next issue",

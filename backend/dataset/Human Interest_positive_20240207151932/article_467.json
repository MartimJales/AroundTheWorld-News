    "text": "Fans who’ve been patiently waiting for the upcoming remakes of two Konami classics in\nMetal Gear Solid 3 and Silent Hill 2 may finally have cause to be excited as both titles have been quietly confirmed as releasing at some point this year.\nIn a\nblog post outlining the big releases of 2024, PlayStation has nodded to both Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2, with a very clear disclaimer in the article saying that “All featured titles scheduled for release in 2024 at the time of publication,” which all but seals the deal. Of course, tentative release dates are always subject to change – especially ones that haven’t been otherwise revealed – but it’s hard to believe we won’t see these launch in the next 12 months.\nThe Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is coming from Konami and developer Virtuous and will seemingly be a faithful recreation of the PS2 classic, going as far as including the original voice work. Meanwhile, the remake Silent Hill 2 is being handled by Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team and will reportedly feature overhauled gameplay mechanics and reimagined story sequences among other updates.\nRELATED: PlayStation Has Revealed The Most-Played Games In Australia And The Rest Of The World In 2023\nHere’s how the\nPlayStation Blog post describes each of the games:\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nRe-discover the origin story of iconic military operative Snake and unravel the plot of the legendary METAL GEAR series. METAL GEAR SOLID DELTA: SNAKE EATER re-envisages the immersive stealth action gameplay of the PS2 classic with modern audio-visual design, returning players to the riveting world of METAL GEAR.\nSilent Hill 2\nExperience a master class in psychological horror – lauded as the best in the series – recreated for PlayStation 5 with chilling visuals and visceral audio.",

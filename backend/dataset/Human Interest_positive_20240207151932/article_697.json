    "text": "Weakest Link howler puts fans in tears! | 00:36 Kealan Hughes – The Sun from News.com.au January 8th, 2024 12:17 pm Fans were left in stitches by a response to a tennis question on the Weakest Link.\nComedian Romesh Ranganathan hosted a radio special of the TV quiz show with one contestant’s answer defying belief.\nStream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\nBBC Radio 1 host Vicky Hawkesworth featured alongside Fi Glover and Owain Wyn Evans but was left feeling red-faced after her bizarre answer.\nThe question that left fans watching on was a seemingly simple: “In sport the US-born tennis player who in the 1990s won all four Grand Slams and an Olympic gold medal is Andre who?”\nThe response was an all-time mix up of two men who share the same name.\nHawkesworth responded confidently with: “The giant”.\nThe correct Andre. (Photo by Mark Dadswell/Getty Images). Source: Supplied\nNot the right Andre. Source: Twitter\nThe radio host had confused eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi for the 223cm professional wrestler, Andre The Giant.\nFellow contestant Rick Edwards burst out laughing, as did many viewers watching from home.\nOne reacted saying: “Hahahahaha the single best answer in quiz show history.”\nAnother added: “Just saw this and spat my tea out.”\nA third wrote: “New balls for Andre The Giant!?!”\nAnd another commented: “Best answer for ages.”\nVicky took the teasing in good spirit and responded on social media saying: “Well I knew it couldn’t be Peter Andre so this was the next best guess!”\nShe added: “How do we know he didn’t play tennis in his spare time?!”\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced with permission.",

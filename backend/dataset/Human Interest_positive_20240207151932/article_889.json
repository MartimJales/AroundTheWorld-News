    "text": "Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Sunday praised the Sardardham Trust, an organisation of the Patidar community, saying that its pursuits — especially the Global Patidar Business Summits (GPBS) — were an example of joint efforts of government and community which can give an impetus to the speed of development.\n“As our Prime Minister has said, when the community efforts second government initiatives, the pace of development doubles. This grand exhibition and expo organised by Sardardham translate that idea into reality…The fourth Global Patidar Business Summit is the best example of joint efforts of government and community,” the Chief Minister, said while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the expo after inaugurating the exhibition virtually.\nGPBS 2024 is a four-day expo organised by the Sardardham Trust, an\nAhmedabad-based organisation of the Patidar community. It is headed by Gagji Sutariya. The expo in Rajkot is the fourth edition of the summit organised after two editions in Gandhinagar and one in Surat. The Chief Minister said that GPBS supports the government’s initiative of vocal for local and making the local global while supporting micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Bhupendra Patel is also one of the trustees of Sardardham.\nAddressing the ceremony, Sutariya thanked the government for giving subsidies to MSMEs for purchasing stalls in GPBS 2024, saying it has halved the cost of stalls for such enterprises and has helped them save to the tune of Rs 8 crore. He also thanked the government for allocating land worth more than Rs 100 crore to Sardardham in various cities of the state for constructing student hotels.\nSutariya said that hostel facilities for more than 3,500 students have been inaugurated and construction of hostels is going on in Vadodara. He added that the trust has plans to construct hostels in Vadodara, Surat, and Rajkot also. “Sardardham and government are two sides of the same coin” added Sutariya.",

    "text": "CHRIS OLAVE. You are insane ðŸ¤¯\nðŸ“º @NFLonCBS pic.twitter.com/DhuvvklaSK\nâ€” New Orleans Saints (@Saints) January 7, 2024\nWhew. Chris Olave made one of the plays of the day on this juggling touchdown catch against the Atlanta Falcons â€” somehow keeping his balance while sprinting into the end zone and tracking the football as it deflected from one hand to another.\nBut the New Orleans Saintsâ€™ star wideout secured the catch to score a go-ahead touchdown. Itâ€™s taken some time for Olave to get in sync with his new quarterback Derek Carr, but heâ€™s finished the year strong and is consistently coming through with tough catches when the team needs them.\nAnd heâ€™s still developing. Olave has made strides this year in fighting for contested catches and running for more yards after the catch. If he can take another step forward in 2024, thereâ€™s no telling how high his ceiling might be.\nArticles Dennis Allen had the least-respectable response to Arthur Smith's complaint Falcons head coach Arthur Smith unamused by Saints running up the score Bucs win the NFC South, here's how Saints can reach playoffs WATCH: Alontae Taylor comes in off the bench for his second career interception",

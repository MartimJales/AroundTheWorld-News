    "text": "Reprinted from the\nMiddle Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Inc.\nThe Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association voted unanimously to elect renowned nature photographer and videographer Michael Kinney as its new Board President and Williamsport-area business owner Katie Caputo was elected to the Board of Directors.\n\"Michael's dedication to our association's work is unmatched. He cherishes every moment spent in our aquatic ecosystem and loves sharing those moments with people through his photos and videos, hoping to inspire them to get involved and make a difference,\" said Riverkeeper John Zaktansky.\n\"He dedicates countless hours to our association and leads by example, listens to others and is passionate about expanding our reach and impact across the 11,000-square-mile watershed we serve.\"\nKinney replaces Marissa Crames, who stepped down to take the position of Program Supervisor for the Vernal School Environmental Education Partnership.\n\"Ever since I was approached by a wild hellbender in 2017, I felt connected to the creatures in my local watershed because as a photographer I was somewhat representing these aquatic creatures to the community I was active in. I discovered the Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association a few weeks later and have been following an important mission of protecting the Eastern hellbender,\" he said. \"Along the way, I discovered how passionate the group represents not only the creatures of the river but the river as a whole from the tiny molecules all the way up to the people that live here and connects it all together as a public service.\n\"Leading a voice for the Middle Susquehanna into 2024 will open my opportunity to protect and improve the watershed we live in, providing a better habitat for the creatures I represent.\"\nYou can contact Kinney via email by .\nBorn and raised in a riverfront community along the West Branch of the Susquehanna, Caputo developed her love for the river as a little girl, spending summers enjoying all the benefits the river has to offer.\nThese early experiences led her to launch\nRoambler.com, a web-based marketplace platform designed to connect adventure seekers with local guides and mentors in Pennsylvania. Caputo believes that providing better access to positive experiences in the outdoors can lead people to love the places they live while building a foundation for environmental stewardship. She is passionate about working to protect the Susquehanna River so it can be enjoyed for generations to come, involved specifically in spreading information about a local Superfund site and sits on the board for the Robert Porter Allen Natural Center.\nYou can contact Caputo via email by . Zaktansky can be contacted via email at or by calling or texting 570-768-6300.\nLearn more about our current Board of Directors at\nwww.middlesusquehannariverkeeper.org/board-of-directors.html.",

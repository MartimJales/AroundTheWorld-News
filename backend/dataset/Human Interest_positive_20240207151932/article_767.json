    "text": "WATCH: ‘Emotional’ CJ Stroud credits God for leading the Texans to playoffs in his rookie season, remembers late cousin who introduced him to football\nThe Houston Texans beat the Indianapolis Colts, 23-19.\nC.J Stroud emotional (Via X)\nThe\nHouston Texans fans had an emotional time as their beloved team made it to the playoffs after four years. They were at the playoff birth in 2019 and after that, they failed to make it to the playoffs every single season. Hence, the celebration peaked after the team made it this year.\nThe architect, who had a monumental impact on the success of the team, also seemed emotional after the victory. In the post-match presentation,\nCJ Stroud seemed to break into tears. He credited the almighty behind the success of himself. In the post-game interview, the rookie said:\nI can’t do nothing, just thank my Lord to save, Jesus Christ man. I’m sorry.CJ Stroud at the post-game interview\nCJ Stroud added as emotions piled up:\nI put a lot of work in my team. Everybody count us out from the start so man it’s just special to see the city of Houston come up again.CJ Stroud added\nNot only through his words but also he expressed his gratitude to the almighty through his actions. The QB played with a wristband that included a sign of a cross. He also had some other symbols that expressed his deep faith in the almighty.\nThe rookie QB was simply sensational against the Colts as he ended the game by covering 264 yards with two touchdowns. He also finished the game cleanly as he was not subjected to any interception.\nWATCH: Arnold Schwarzenegger feeding a donkey on ManningCast leaves Peyton and Eli Manning stunned\nCJ Stroud is the favorite for the OROY Award\nWith his brilliant performance on the gridiron, C.J. Stroud is the favorite for the Offensive Rookie of the Year Award. The quarterback has had a tough competition with the wide receiver of the Rams’ Puka Nacua. But Nacua seems to be left behind after the stellar performance on the turf.\nStroud has broken multiple records this season. Stroud became the fifth quarterback in history to\nsurpass more than 4,000 yards. He also ended up as the QB with the least number of interceptions this season. These statistics can help him to take over Puka Nacua.\nBetters have already settled high hopes for the quarterback after seeing the brilliant performance on the turf. It is to be seen now whether the QB manages to win the Award by beating Nacua.\nIn case you missed it:",

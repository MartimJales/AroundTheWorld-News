    "text": "Trevor Lawrence received a sweet game-day message Sunday from wife Marissa ahead of the Jagaurs’ critical regular-season finale against the Titans. In a post shared on her Instagram Stories, Marissa — who has been married to the Jaguars quarterback since April 2021 — posted a photo of Lawrence, 24, from what appeared to be a tarmac. “Happy game day baby @tlawrence16,” she captioned the snap. Lawrence was activated for Sunday’s game in Tennessee after missing last week’s 26-0 win over Carolina due to a shoulder injury. The Jaguars, currently 9-7 in the AFC South, could clinch the division in back-to-back seasons with a win on Sunday. Should Jacksonville lose, though, they would miss the playoffs and the Texans would take the AFC South crown following a 23-19 win over the Colts on Saturday night. The Jaguars trailed the Titans in the fourth quarter, 28-20. This is Lawrence’s third season with the Jaguars, who selected the former Clemson product with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. Through 15 games this season, Lawrence has thrown for 3,736 yards, 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He helped lead Jacksonville to the postseason last year before they were eliminated by the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs in the divisional round. Marissa has continued to support Lawrence and the Jaguars every step of the way. Shortly after Jacksonville’s playoff ouster last January, Marissa penned a heartfelt tribute to the star quarterback. “As always I am so proud of you Trev. I’m honored to be by your side through it all!! What a year.. so much to be thankful for!” she exclaimed on Instagram.",

    "text": "[Jamie Lee Curtis](https://doyouremember.com/196068/jamie-lee-curtis-john-carpenters-advice-halloween-role) has a cultural trend she wants thrust into the spotlight. On Saturday, Curtis attended the Independent Spirit [Awards](https://doyouremember.com/183955/elizabeth-taylor-cleopatra-turns-60-film-nearly-destroyed-studio). There, Curtis used the platform to issue a message through The Hollywood Reporter, calling for artists to do matinee concerts, the better to perform during the day and wrap up before bedtime. Matinees are popular in the world of theater – and in the case of stage productions, are usually performed on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Musical artists don’t usually perform at those hours, more often favoring starting at 8 pm at the earliest. But introducing matinee concerts is an idea Curtis is very passionate about and has discussed it on multiple occasions. Here’s her vision. Jamie Lee Curtis wants matinee concerts to become mainstream While speaking to THR, Curtis [urged](https://consequence.net/2023/03/jamie-lee-curtis-matinee-concerts/), “I am gonna just say this now as a taunt and as a suggestion: U2, do a matinee.” She went on, “Coldplay: do a matinee. What about a 12-noon concert, Coldplay? What about it?” She then called on Bruce Springsteen to do the same.

Curtis continued on to explain the reasoning behind this strategy, “You’re old! Why wouldn’t you [let me come see you, Bruce Springsteen](https://doyouremember.com/178723/bruce-springsteen-clears-the-air-sleeps-with-guitar), in your glory days — pun intended — and do it at noon or 1 o’clock? 2 o’clock! 2 o’clock matinee! Theatre in New York, 2 o’clock! I will come and hear your five-hour concert, Bruce, at 2 o’clock, and I’m gonna be home and in bed by 7:30 [p.m.].” Curtis’s call to action has gained national attention It didn’t take long for Curtis’s statements to go viral and they became a topic of conversation when Curtis appeared on Today on Tuesday, March 7. “Why are there no matinees?” she mused with co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie. “For instance, I love Coldplay. I would love to go see Coldplay. The problem is I’m not gonna go see Coldplay if they start their show at 9 o’clock and there’s an opening act. I want to hear Coldplay at 1:00 p.m. I think if we filled a stadium of people who want to see a matinee of Coldplay, I think we would start a trend.” Curtis admitted she prefers getting up early in the morning, so [anything that cuts too deep into her sleep](https://doyouremember.com/197747/jamie-lee-curtis-gym-body-post-thanksgiving-workout-photo) is something she tries to excise from her life as often as possible. In fact, she added, if a dinner starts after 5 pm, there’s a good chance she’ll turn down the invite, a policy Guthrie called “hardcore.” Would you attend a matinee concert as envisioned by Curtis?",

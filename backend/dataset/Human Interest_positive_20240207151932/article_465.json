    "text": "A connection problem at home? Acer showed off two routers that have some very cool technologies on paper. Acer Predator Connect X7 5G CPE, with a cubic design // Source: Acer At CES 2024, Acer presented its new PC screens and laptop PCs. But also routers, which are a little special. At the top of the list, the Predator Connect X7 5G CPE and the Predator Connect T7 Wi-Fi 7, two routers with an unprecedented technical sheet. 5G and Wi-Fi 7 The Predator Connect X7 5G CPE is a real novelty. This is’un routeur 5G CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) which, according to Acer, offers the possibility of creating a BE11000 tri-band Wi-Fi 7 connection from a 5G signal. A super-fast Wi-Fi 7 hotspot that requires no additional equipment. Acer Predator Connect X7 5G CPE // Source : Acer This innovation does not stop there: the router also supports dual connectivity, allowing users to choose between a 5G connection and an Ethernet connection (with ADSL, optical fiber or others behind) according to their needs. The Predator Connect X7 5G incorporates load balancing and failover mechanisms to ensure a stable and reliable internet connection. This remains a complete router with advanced features, like the Intel Killer prioritization engine. This means the router can prioritize network traffic for specific applications, ensuring optimal performance for gaming or video streaming. No 5G, but Qualcomm Multi-Link Mesh technology The Predator Connect T7 Wi-Fi 7 has the same characteristics, with a more sober design, and without 5G. This router has no visible antennas, and a reduced number of Ethernet ports for a more minimalist appearance. Despite a simpler aesthetic, the T7 is a concentrate of technology. It has a USB Type-C port, supports Qualcomm Multi-Link Mesh technology for extended network coverage, and integrates Hybrid QoS software working in tandem with Intel Killer. Acer Predator Connect T7 Wi-Fi 7 Mesh // Source : Acer Although details on pricing and availability remain to be confirmed, we can already certify that these are not “entry-level” routers. And for what performance? For the moment, we do not yet know the promised performances. However, Wi-Fi 7, known technically as 802.11be, is designed to deliver speeds of up to 30 Gbps, almost triple that of Wi-Fi 6, thanks to more efficient use of the 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz spectrum. This new standard also improves latency and increases capacity, allowing more devices to connect simultaneously without compromising performance. On the other hand, the 5Gwith its different frequency bands, offers download speeds which can theoretically reach 10 Gbps (and 3.5 Gbps on the Acer Predator Connect X7 5G CPE router), as well as reduced latency. For the moment, however, the 5G deployed in France makes it possible to reach 1 Gbps, under the best conditions.

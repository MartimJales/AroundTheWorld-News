    "text": "HOUSTON – This Tuesday is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.\nThe day falls on the 9th of January every year. It is a day where we honor those who have dedicated their lives to the safety and security of our communities.\nThe day was created in 2015 as a way to express gratitude for officers in the United States. It was created following a series of events in 2014, when a police officer was involved in a shooting in Missouri.\nThe backlash after the event led the national organization C.O.P.S. (Concerns of Police Survivors) to work to change the negative portrayal of police officers in the news to a positive one. The day also raises awareness about the difficult decisions police officers have to make\n“In light of recent negativity directed toward law enforcement nationally, there is a need to show law enforcement officers that our citizens recognize the difficult and sometimes impossible career they have chosen, in public service to us all,” the organization says.\nThere are several ways you can show your support for law enforcement on Tuesday.\n_\nThe organization C.O.P.S. shared different ways you can show your support.\nThey encourage people to wear blue in support of law enforcement. You can also send a card of support to your local police department or state agency.\nThe organization also encourages people to share a story about a positive law enforcement experience on social media.\nYou can find other ways to show your support for law enforcement here.\nIs your loved one a law enforcement officer? Share your pictures of them in uniform to Click2Pins.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

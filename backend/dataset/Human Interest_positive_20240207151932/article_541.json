    "text": "By Marius Payton\nClick here for updates on this story\nNASHVILLE, Tennessee ( WSMV ) -- It’s a place where an otherwise complex life is simplified. Heart of Mary House in Nashville walks hand in hand with terminally ill patients in their final days. It’s a loving and learning process for all involved. But as WSMV4&apos;s Marius Payton found, while some prepared to die, they’ve also finally found what was missing in their lives.\nA transition starts when patients enter through the blue door.\n“You can come here, and everything makes sense,” said Kim Derrick, the executive director and co-founder of Heart of Mary House. “There is no confusion. There is nothing contradicting itself. It’s just as pure as it seems from the outside.”\nPatients, like Butch Potts, know why he’s here and what’s next.\n“I’m having total heart failure. That’s going on,” Potts said. “I have 8 percent of my heart left now. I know I’m dying, but I’m at peace with it.”\nHeart of Mary House is a much-needed place for people who are at the end of their lives and have nowhere else to go. Whether it’s one week or three months, the care these patients get is all the same. So, what’s the cost?\n“Completely free,” Derrick said.\nHeart of Mary House uses donations to pay for the home care and needs of all its patients. No federal or state funding is used. No insurance either.\nThe House runs on the kindness of people’s hearts. The majority of volunteer staff teaches lessons about forgiveness, gratitude, and unconditional love — not with books, but with actions. A game of checkers or songs by the piano often brings a smile and sometimes tears of joy to some who are facing mortality and need a pick me up.\nYou can see in Butch’s eyes he has lived a rough life. After spending nearly three lonely decades in prison, he’s now dying but not alone.",

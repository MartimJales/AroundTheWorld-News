    "text": "San Francisco 49ers defensive star\nFred Warner and one-time reality dating show contestant Sydney Hightower Warner announced this week that they're expecting a baby boy.\nSydney, who grew up in Alabama, was cast on pilot Peter Weber's season of \"The Bachelor\" that aired in early 2020. Although she was eliminated in week six, the show still led to love for the then-retail marketing manager: Sydney said Warner hit her up on social media. “He actually sent me an emoji [because] he didn’t think I was gonna respond and that’s why he got really casual,\" she told\nUS Weekly, \"but it was sweet.\"\nThe pair began dating and got engaged in May 2021 —\ncomplete with a red rose a la \"The Bachelor.\" The Warners married about a year later in Vista, San Diego County. This is their first child together.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nOn Tuesday, the pair announced they're having a boy with an adorable video posted to Instagram. \"Can I look at it first?\" Sydney asks nervously as they wait to click on the news, presumably from their health care provider. \"Stop, let's go,\" Fred says. Then, spoiler for your ears, Fred lets out a joyful scream as they learn they're having a boy.\nIt's a busy time for the Warner family. On Sunday, the 49ers end the regular season at home against the Rams. Then, they're set for a first-round bye week after\nwrapping up the NFC's top seed last week. Baby Warner is due in March.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad",

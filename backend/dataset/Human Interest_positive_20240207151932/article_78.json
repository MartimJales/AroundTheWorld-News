    "text": "It was a year full of ups and downs, but now, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are NFC South champions.\nThe team clinched the division with a win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, and although it was a rough 9-0 victory, it was exactly what Tampa Bay needed to go to the playoffs. This is the fourth year in a row the Bucs are headed to the playoffs and the third year in a row they clinched the NFC South, and of course, Bucs fans had a lot to say about it ‚Äî and they brought receipts from the beginning of the year.\nHere is what Bucs fans and neutral observers had to say after the game:\nBucs were pretty bad today. Multiple dropped INTs by Panthers. Panthers fumble at inch yard line. Have Panthers TD called back by a formation penalty that had nothing to do with play. Missed Panthers FG.\nFound a way though. Back to the playoffs again. Happy for Bucs fans.\n‚Äî Jon Ledyard (@LedyardNFLDraft) January 7, 2024\n0-0 Go Bucs!\n‚Äî Dave Canales (@DcoachCanales) January 7, 2024\nWinfield has saved the Bucs 10 points today\n‚Äî Jon Ledyard (@LedyardNFLDraft) January 7, 2024\n‚ÄúYou must be on crack if you think the Bucs will somehow sneak into the Super Bowl and win it all‚Äù\nMe: pic.twitter.com/kJENa0bAPt\n‚Äî ùóóùóù (@DJBucsFan) January 7, 2024\nBaker Mayfield:\n‚Äì Browns dump him after winning a playoff game, trade him to Panthers\n‚Äì Panthers dump him after not even a full season on terrible roster, Rams claim him\n‚Äì Rams claim him, plays well in short run in LA\n‚Äì Bucs sign him, leads team to division title\nAmazing pic.twitter.com/ZkVCuj9fT4\n‚Äî Josh Callaway (@JoshMCallaway) January 7, 2024\nBaker took the Winless Browns to the playoffs and now the Brady-less Bucs to the playoffs.\nDude is a true competitor\n‚Äî Will Blackmon üç∑ (@WillBlackmon) January 7, 2024\nNFC SOUTH CHAMPS AGAIN BABY! pic.twitter.com/iQivavS6LY\n‚Äî ‚Ä¢ Christie ‚Ä¢ ‚ù§Ô∏è (@AllAboutBucs) January 7, 2024\nCongrats to Baker Mayfield for leading the Bucs to the playoffs replacing the GOAT.

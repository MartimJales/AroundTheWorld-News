    "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass — On a snowy first Sunday in January, Greg Zuerlein’s three field goals (21, 40, 32) and a late touchdown by Breece Hall were the difference in the Jets (7-10) 17-3 victory against the Patriots (4-13).\nGang Green snapped its 15-game losing streak against New England with the win. Before Sunday, the Jets’ last victory against the Patriots was on Dec. 27, 2015.\nZuerlein was huge for the Jets. He made 3-of-4 field goal attempts, including a 40-yarder in the second quarter to give the Jets the lead for good.\nThe Jets defense consistently pressured Patriots quarterback Bailey Zappe the entire game, finishing with six sacks and two turnovers.\nTrevor Siemian only completed 8-of-20 passes for 70 yards. Siemian started his third consecutive game for Zach Wilson, who has been in concussion protocol since the Jets 30-0 loss to the Dolphins in Week 15.\nThe Jets finished with 250 yards of total offense.\n A lot of Gang Green’s offense came from Hall. He finished with a career-high in rushing attempts with 36, along with 174 yards and a 50-yard touchdown run with 1:47 left in the game to put the game on ice.\nHall reached the 1,500 all-purpose yards mark for the season against New England. He is the fourth Jets running back to accomplish the feat.\nZappe started his sixth game of the season but struggled to get anything going. He completed 9-of-25 passes for 65 yards and and two interceptions. New England running back Ezekiel Elliott finished with 55 rushing yards on 13 carries.\nThe Jets and Patriots have been offensively challenged all season, and the season finale was no different, especially with the elements to deal with. The two teams combined to score nine points during the first two quarters. They also punted the ball a total of eight times during that span.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2024 New York Daily News. Visit at nydailynews.com. ",

    "text": "Jurgen Klopp was delighted with Liverpool's second half display against Arsenal Liverpool stepped up to prevail 2-0 and reach the fourth round of the FA Cup It's about survival! FA Cup replays must remain for the good of English football - It's All Kicking Off\nJurgen Klopp roared that he was ‘super proud’ of his Liverpool players as they marched in the FA Cup fourth round with victory over Arsenal.\nJakub Kiwior’s own goal and Luis Diaz’s late strike secured a euphoric 2-0 win for the Merseysiders at the Emirates.\nThe Anfield club were without a host of key players for the game and Klopp said: ‘I’m super proud. It’s a super difficult draw. Maybe the most difficult we could have got.\n‘With all the things we had to consider coming here, we scored the goals and brought the kids on. We fought for 95 minutes.’\nCaptain Virgil van Dijk missed the game through illness, but there is hope he will be available for Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final versus Fulham.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he is ‘super proud’ of his players after beating Arsenal\nLuis Diaz scored in the closing stages to make it 2-0 as Liverpool reached the fourth round\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nLiverpool are also still involved in the Carabao Cup and host Fulham on Wednesday in the first leg of their semi-final.\nKlopp admitted that it was difficult to enjoy Liverpool’s first half performance before they improved in the second period.\nKlopp said: ‘For tonight, great. Wednesday is the next game and then a few days off. We have to make steps if you want to be where we are and around that area then we have to make steps all of the time. It wasn’t an easy game to enjoy in the first half.’\nLiverpool are currently top of the Premier League and are also through to the round of 16 in the Europa League as Klopp’s team chase silverware, with the quadruple still in their sights.\nLiverpool are still involved in four competitions as Klopp’s team look to win silverware\nMohamed Salah, who is with Egypt ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, was missing for Liverpool\nLiverpool defender Virgil van Dijk was also unavailable against Arsenal because of illness\nThe Reds were without Mohamed Salah against Arsenal due to the winger being away with Egypt ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations.\nKlopp will hope that Liverpool will have enough resources to cope in Salah’s absence and will have taken heart from the spirit that his team showed in the second half against Arsenal.\nIn addition to van Dijk’s absence through illness, Dominik Szoboszlai and Andrew Robertson were amongst those missing through injury.",

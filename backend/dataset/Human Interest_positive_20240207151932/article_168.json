    "text": "BANGOR -- Bangor's Mansion Church is more than a place of worship.\nThe building provides a community, free clothing, warm meals and a safe place to sleep during the cold winter months.\nPastor Terry D inkins said that the church has helped those experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity.\n\"We open up every night. We started N ov. 1 and go until the end of March. We open up at 6 p.m. with a hot meal, they have opportunities for showers, clothes, handwarmers , jackets, [and] boots when they leave,\" he said.\nWhile the majority of the warming center guests are unhoused people, Pastor D inkins said that all are welcome.\nThe pastor shared that those who have lost power in storms are invited to sleep, eat, and shower at the church while staying warm.\n\"It's open to whoever shall come,\" he stated.\nIn addition to providing resources, Dinkins says the center also offers a sense of belonging for its staff members.\nOne staff member, David Turavani, shared his excitement to give back to the community after experiencing homelessness himself.\n\"It feels good to help people because I've been out there. I was homeless since I was 16 years old, too, and ended up in a shelter, and got my own place, that I've had now for over five years.\"\nTuravani credited Dinkins for helping him find a stable place to live. \"I felt like it was time to give back, so that's what I do...it's helped me change my life,\" he added.\nDarlene Ray-Green, a staff member responsible for organizing and laundering clothing donations, stated that she also appreciates the opportunity to give back to the community.\n\"I get to meet a lot of new people and do what I can. I love doing it, and now that I'm back in church, I really like it,\" she said.\nThe church accepts all kinds of donations, and is always seeking volunteers.\nFor donation information, contact the Mansion Church on Facebook .\n Cali Warren News Reporter\nAuthor email Follow Cali Warren ",

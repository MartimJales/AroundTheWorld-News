    "text": "[VO Vets](https://vovets.com/), families can trust their furry family members will be handled with love and care. VO Vets, and its managing owner, Dr. Miller, has a simple mission: to provide warm, friendly pet care with less stress to families in and around Fort Worth. VO Vets combines a highly qualified team of veterinarians and support staff, quality care, and leading-edge technology to ensure pets are getting the best care possible. In addition, the clinic is committed to offering hours that are accessible to all pet owners. VO Vets is open 8 a.m.- 7 p.m. seven days a week, so even busy pet owners balancing work, school or kids can make sure their pets are happy and healthy—at a time that is most convenient for them. Meet Dr. Russell Miller Dr. Miller grew up on a small farm in Indiana surrounded by horses, cattle, dogs and cats. In grade school, he found himself competing in Future Farmers of America (FFA) events and even won the high school state division as an eighth grader. In his undergraduate tenure, he leaned into his passion for science, math, animals, people and agriculture and continued to learn more about animal health and veterinary medicine. After graduating, he was accepted into Purdue University where he settled on a veterinary specialty and became interested in the business side of the industry. Before opening VO Vets, Dr. Miller spent years working at two 24-hour emergency pet hospitals. When he was offered the chance to start his own business in Fort Worth, he knew it was time to take things to the next level. “VO Vets stands for veterinary ownership,” he said. “The idea is we're providing quality care and allow for each pet to essentially be treated as family members. Giving back to the community Dr. Miller said his goal at VO Vets is to provide a high-quality veterinary experience for both pets and people in the community. To fulfill his mission, Dr. Miller is dedicated to giving back to the Fort Worth community and sponsors multiple school sports teams, including Byron Nelson High School and Timber Creek High School. The animal hospital also partners with Keller ISD and Northwest ISD on Career and Technical Education (CTE) programming initiatives. The partnership with the schools' technical CTE programs allows high school students to work paid shadowing hours at VO Vets so they can graduate with a Certificate of Veterinary Assistance (CVA). Outside of Fort Worth, Dr. Miller also volunteers his veterinary services at The Iditarod, an annual long-distance sled dog race in Alaska. Providing excellent care At the end of the day, Dr. Miller’s top priority is to provide top-notch veterinary care. VO Vets offers a number of services to help keep pets happy and healthy, including: - wellness care - pet vaccinations - pet dental care - spay and neuter - walk-in and urgent care - parasite prevention In addition to taking excellent care of clients’ pets, Dr. Miller and his team also treat people with respect and grace. “We understand that people are sometimes having a bad day or worried about their loved ones,” he said. “And we try to coach the reception team and just the team in general, so that we can help them have a better day.” Learn more about VO Vets Dr. Miller said there are several talented veterinarians in the Fort Worth area, which motivates him and his staff to continually improve upon their services and convenience. Some of the ways VO Vets does this is by offering online scheduling services as well as a mobile app where clients can view their pets’ needs and book appointments. Overall, Dr. Miller said what truly makes VO Vets successful is being human and personable. “[People] just want you to have the best intentions for their loved ones,” he said. VO Vets is located at 12650 N Beach St., Ste. 148, Fort Worth. For more information, call 682-350-8890 or visit the [website](https://vovets.com/).

    "text": "Dear Monty: Our contract called for the buyer to move in on the closing day. It is two weeks before closing, and they want to move the closing up five days. We scheduled the movers for the day before closing and could not move the date. Now, they are threatening to back out. Any advice would be appreciated. Monty: An attorney’s immediate counsel is required. The attorney will be able to advise you. Assuming you have a solid contract, the buyer may come to their senses when learning about the potential consequences. Whether you have numerous moves under your belt or this is your first home sale, signals can get crossed and something like this can happen. Minimize Risk with Rent After Closing It is an excellent practice for the seller to occupy after closing and pay daily rent for a short period. This negotiation is a conscious part of the offer to purchase. The closing often does not occur as scheduled. That condition may have made the buyer’s request doable. When the closing fails but the seller agreed to vacate on or before the day of closing, it will be frustrating and expensive for both parties unless they have protected themselves contractually. Moving Tips - Only take things you need; holding garage sales can help. - Label boxes by number and whether they contain fragile items. Keep a separate corresponding list by box number of the contents and the room to place it in for unpacking purposes. - Even if you left the old home spotless, your new home may not be. In the purchase agreement, insist on a clean, vacant house. Have cleaning supplies handy, just in case. - Avoid carrying heavy boxes alone or a stack of boxes tall enough to obstruct your vision. - Have a first aid kit on hand just in case of an accident. - Take an inventory of items and walk through the home for a final inspection of empty rooms, closets, the basement, cupboards and the attic. The purchase contract should contain a pre-closing inspection a day or two before the closing. - You should set aside essential tools like a screwdriver, pliers, tape measure and hammer, which are readily accessible. Checklist Check off the procedures and items below to ensure you are ready for a successful move. - If you previously rented, coordinate the move with your lease’s end and give your landlord proper notice. - Do a change of address at the post office. - Notify banks, insurance companies, friends, relatives and employers of your new address. - Be sure newspapers, magazines and other subscription services are aware of your new address. - Advise all utility companies of your moving date at the prior and new locations. - Reserve a tentative date with the moving company. - Plan care for pets and plants. - Get agreement on the date of occupancy. - Gather all your house keys, including from friends or relatives. Leave them with the new owner. - Go through the home after loading everything to ensure you did not leave anything behind. - Unhook appliances to be ready for moving. - Have a new address recorded on your driver’s license. - At the new home, check all the pilot lights and smoke detector batteries. Caution: Unmentioned items may fit individual circumstances not covered here.",

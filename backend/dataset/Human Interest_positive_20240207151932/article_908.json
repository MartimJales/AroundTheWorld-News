CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here .\nWhat you need to know today Hot jobs market\nThe U.S. labor market added 216,000 jobs in December. That's much more than the 170,000 expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones, and the downwardly revised 173,000 jobs added in November. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, defying estimates of a 10-basis-point rise. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 4.1% from a year earlier, higher than the 3.9% forecast.\nLosing week\nU.S. stocks inched up slightly Friday, but couldn't reverse a weekly decline. Treasury yields ticked up for the second day, with the 10-year yield closing at 4.051%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index retreated 0.27% . Retail stocks fell 1.1%, leading sector losses, after data showed German retail sales fell 2.5% for the month, much more than estimates of a 0.1% slide.\nGet San Diego local news, weather forecasts, sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC San Diego newsletters.\nGrounded airplanes\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has ordered a temporary grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, which means airlines won't be able to use those particular Boeing models for flying. The directive comes after a piece of the aircraft blew out in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole on the side of the plane.\nPotential Apple lawsuit\nApple just can't catch a break. Fresh off a downgrade to its shares by Barclays and Piper Sandler , the technology giant is potentially facing an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a report from The New York Times. The lawsuit could target how the Apple Watch works exclusively with the iPhone, as well as the company's iMessage service, which excludes non-Apple devices.\n[PRO] Numbers to watch\nThe U.S. consumer price index report comes out Thursday this week, and will be the major catalyst for markets as investors assess if the U.S. Federal Reserve is edging closer to its goal of keeping inflation at 2%. But don't neglect Friday, which is jam-packed with earnings reports from big banks such as JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Bank of America .",

    "text": "Salvation Army offers warm space to Sheringham residents published on 2 Jan 2024 People in Sheringham can benefit from a warm space this winter provided by The Salvation Army church in the town. The space in the church at Cremer Street will open on 11 January and every Thursday from 10am to 1pm, offering locals a safe place to stay warm, have a free hot drink or snack and meet new people. Visitors can join in with board games, read the papers, knit, use the Wifi, speak to church leaders or sit and have time to be quiet or reflect. There is no need to prebook. The warm space will add another layer of support for vulnerable individuals or those who have been affected by the ongoing cost of living crisis and will operate on Thursdays only concurrently with the established Community Drop-In Sessions and Food Club (Community Store). Simon Fenn, community manager, believes the warm space will strengthen The Salvation Armyâ€™s existing support for the community. He said: \"We are really pleased to be able to run a Warm Space from January as it will complement our existing community programme and offer a comprehensive, person-centred, approach to connecting with our local communities demonstrating God's unconditional love and compassion.\" If you would like more information, please contact Simon Fenn (Community Manager) on 01263 826059 or by emailing [simon.fenn@salvationarmy.org.uk](mailto:simon.fenn@salvationarmy.org.uk). This Warm Space is possible thanks to Norfolk Community Foundation, which is creating Community Warm Spaces all over the county. For more information, head to norfolkfoundation.com.",

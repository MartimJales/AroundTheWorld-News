Updated: 19 hours ago| There is some cold air behind the cold front. In fact, inland temperatures will be flirting with freezing tonight; closer to the coast, temps will be in the mid 30s. Wind chills will be even colder in the 20s! Bundle up as you head out tonight and in the morning. Tuesday will be drier and chilly with highs staying in the 50s. A gulf low will bring us high rain chances on Wednesday, and it will be a cold, winter rain which could drop one to three inches of rain. Updated: Jan. 1, 2024 at 5:41 AM CST| Happy New Year! Today brings some 60s in the afternoon. And then a cold front turns our weather chillier for tomorrow. Plus, Wednesday looks wet. Click and watch the forecast video for details. Updated: Dec. 31, 2023 at 5:30 PM CST| Happy New Year! If you’re heading out to celebrate tonight, the weather will be quiet and chilly. Temperatures will be dropping into the low and mid 40s by the sunrise. There is a chance for some patchy, dense fog overnight and in the morning. We’ll be a little warmer on New Year’s Day with highs in the mid 60s. A quick moving front will bring a few hit or miss showers around midday, but it looks like any rain will be light. Most of us will not see any rain, but we do expect more cloud cover. That front will drop temps to near freezing waking up on Tuesday morning. We will stay cool Tuesday afternoon with highs in only the mid to upper 50s.",

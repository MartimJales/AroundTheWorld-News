    "text": "Cold mornings, but a warmer weekend ahead The warming trend begins today for us, as skies will be sunny all day, and winds will be light. Our high temperature will make it to the upper 50s in most locations, and humidity will stay low. More changes are coming as we head into the New Year’s Eve. It will still be cold to start your day Sunday, with clear skies, light winds, and temperatures on the north shore in the low to mid 30s. In the New Orleans area, the temperature should be in the low 40s. Winds will start to shift and become more southerly by late in the day Sunday, which will be sunny and a high temperature in the mid 60s is expected. Ringing in the new year looks dry with a temperature in the 50s, and weather should be very nice. Clouds will increase overnight Monday into New Year’s Day and there’s a 50% chance for showers on Monday, with a high in the low 60s again. Rainfall amounts should generally be less than a quarter of an inch. Tuesday will be dry, but Wednesday looks to be the rain day of this week. Showers and thunderstorms will be numerous on Wednesday, and over an inch of rain as possible. As the cold front moves through late Wednesday afternoon temperatures will be back into the 50s by Thursday and Friday.",

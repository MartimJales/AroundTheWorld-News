    "text": "The Outlook: Is that snow in the forecast?\nHappy new year! With a new year comes a new weather pattern here in Utah. This is certainly welcome news. As the author of a column titled The Outlook, it is admittedly nice to have something to actually look out for.\nThe pattern is going to start to shift by Thursday of this week. The previous pattern was one in which storms were dropping down well off the California coast, stalling for several days, then slowly ejecting inland through the desert southwest in a much warmer, weakened state.\nThis has caused our snowpack in Park City (Thaynes Canyon) to fall to just 59% of median as of Jan. 1.\nNot only was this a sub-optimal pattern for snowfall in Utah, but it was also a poor pattern for snow anywhere in the western United States. As such, snowpacks across western North America have suffered.\nOver the next week, the storm track is going to gradually shift farther north. The first storm will still track to our south, but should be close enough for snow showers to reach the Wasatch mountains on Thursday. Accumulations should remain light, but we cannot rule out a few inches of high-elevation snowfall by Friday morning.\nA subsequent, stronger storm is going to track into the Great Basin of Nevada by this weekend. That will bring additional periods of snow showers to northern Utah mountains, including Park City, on Saturday and Sunday.\nThe other element of this new winter weather pattern will be cold air. Because our storms are coming more directly from the northwest, they will be able to pull in colder air into the region before it is moderated by the subtropics.\nTemperatures are going to drop through this weekend. We aren’t expecting anything overly frigid, but it’s going to feel like Summit County in mid-winter — which is more than we can say of much of the past few weeks.\nFrom a ski and snowboard perspective, each day will have the potential for a bit of fresh snow Thursday through the weekend. Right now, the highest likelihood for a true powder day is Sunday.\nThe good news is that this pattern of cold and active weather is likely to continue into next week. This is well-timed for ski conditions to improve just in time for the Sundance Film Festival. This is when Park City locals practice their other favorite pastime — watching festival goers struggle to navigate through snow.\nLet us hope that this favorable start to 2024 is a harbinger of good things to come for the rest of our winter season!\nFor up-to-date forecasts, you can subscribe to Evan’s Utah Daily Snow forecast on OpenSnow.com and the OpenSnow app.\nWay We Were: Overlapping lines and drawn pistols\nOn Feb. 20, 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes sent the name of New Yorker Michael Shaughnessy to the Senate for confirmation as the 11th U.S. marshal for Utah. His nomination was ratified on March 12. Shaughnessy, wife Eudora, daughters Eudora and Mary, and son Philip arrived March 21 in Salt Lake City, where he took office.\nSee more\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Park City and Summit County make the Park Record's work possible.

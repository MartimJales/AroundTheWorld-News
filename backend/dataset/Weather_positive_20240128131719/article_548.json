The Howth woman has been relaxing up north with husband Spencer Matthews and their three kids Theodore, Gigi and Otto over Christmas and New Year. The family-of-five are currently staying on the Glen Affric Estate in Inverness-shire, Scotland, which is owned by Mathews’ family. The estate is located in the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by an epic mountain range and series of lakes. Vogue posted on Instagram: “I despise cold water and do not like being cold, I even think the sea in Spain in the summer is cold. Saying that I’ve been getting into this with @spencermatthews who sits in there like a duck happy as Larry. \"Some days I was AWFUL, today I managed a minute, it definitely makes you feel so good!” Vogue captioned her swim. Vogue previously wrote about how much she was looking forward to having some down time to relax. “We have been looking forward to this time away with our family for so long.

    "text": "Fireball meteors are forecast to light up the UAE's skies this week in the first celestial display of 2024.\nStargazers are being urged not to miss out on the chance to catch the Quadrantids meteor shows, which are expected to be at peak visibility on Thursday evening and Friday morning.\nAs many as 200 meteors can be seen an hour in ideal conditions. Visibility depends on weather.\nQuadrantids are renowned for their bright fireball meteors, which are large explosions of light and colour.\nDubai Astronomy Group will host a viewing of the event at Al Qudra Desert from 11pm on Thursday.\nRead More The dazzling celestial events set to light up UAE skies in 2024 The gathering is expected to last until 4am on Friday.\n“The Quadrantids typically display activity from late December to the second week of January, with the peak occurring on January 4-5 in Dubai this year,” Dubai Astronomy Group said on its website.\n“Unlike other meteor shows that enjoy a more extended peak period, the Quadrantids peak for just a short burst of a few hours.”\nThe group said that the position of the Moon could interfere with this year's meteor shower.\n“This year, the Moon’s presence may impact the meteors’ clarity, making them less distinct compared to a moonless night. It won’t be as crystal clear as on a moonless night, so we’re presenting this as a casual stargazing event with the possibility of catching a glimpse of meteors.”\nTickets for the event cost between Dh80 and Dh140. Details can be found on the group's website.\nIn December, about 500 people gathered in Al Qudra desert to witness the Geminids meteor shower at an event staged by the group.\nDespite cloudy conditions being forecast , clear weather helped stargazers see the bright meteors that moved at speeds of 125,528kph.\nUAE star gazers – in pictures\nGeminids meteor About 500 people gathered at the Al Qudra desert to observe the Geminids meteor shower.

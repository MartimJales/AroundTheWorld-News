    "text": "WEST READING, Pa. – A local doctor is offering some safety tips in case you will be outside in the potential snow that is forecasted for this weekend.\n\"First off, I want people to enjoy the weather and do things outside,\" said Dr. Brian Lahmann, chair of emergency medicine at Tower Health.\nLahmann said there are a few things to think about.\n\"The first thing that comes to mind is if you're going outside, make sure that you're dressed appropriately so you don't result in cold injuries, such as frostbite to your hands or your feet,\" Lahmann said.\nHe also said to follow directions on equipment or devices.\nHe said there are typically two injuries that can happen.\n\"One, from the snow and debris being blown from the snow blowers, so wear eye protection, stay at a safe distance if there's others around you,\" Lahmann advised.\nHe said other injuries can happen when snow blowers get clogged with ice and snow.\n\"Do not put your hands or fingers into an active working snow blower to remove the debris,\" Lahmann said.\nIt is something he said you should not do even when the snow blower is off.\n\"What we find is when individuals do that, those blades can kick back, and we've seen injuries to fingers, including amputations,\" Lahmann explained.\nAlso, when it comes to shoveling snow, he said it requires a lot of physical exertion.\n\"So, we do see folks who present having a heart attack from removing snow,\" Lahmann said.\nHe said to stop and rest if you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing.\n\"If the pain doesn't resolve or you have any concerning symptoms, then call 911 and seek help,\" Lahmann instructed.\nHe also said if your toes and fingers start feeling numb and they are looking discolored, it is time to go inside and warm up.\nScroll down for comments if available\nWhat others are reading... ❄️ Weekend storm: Widespread accumulating snow likely for parts of the area 3:14",

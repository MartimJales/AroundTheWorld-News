He wrote: ‘What a way to start our spectacular New Year’s Eve fireworks show!’\nIn true British fashion, large parts of the country have welcomed 2024 in with a deluge of rain, but many who are out and about to celebrate the occasion will do their best not to let it dampen their spirits.\nThe iconic London fireworks were said to have soared as high as 200m into the air when they were launched from the London Eye on the stroke of midnight.\nIn Scotland, the 30th Hogmanay street party in Edinburgh will be headlined by rock band Pulp after their surprise reunion last year.\nEdinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said: ‘After the difficult years of the pandemic, I’m overjoyed that our festivals are back to their brilliant best and providing such high calibre cultural offerings for our residents and visitors.’\nElsewhere, there has already been an impressive firework show in Blackpool, as the explosives erupted into the sky with Blackpool Tower illuminated in the background.\nNEWCASTLE: A group of girls brave the horrible weather to see in the New Year together\nNEWCASTLE: A reveller covers her head from the rain with a piece of fabric as she heads out into town\nNEWCASTLE: A woman holds her coat aloft in a bid to keep dry ahead of New Year celebrations\nNEWCASTLE: Hardy revellers take cover under umbrellas, coats and even handbags to stay safe from the elements\nBLACKPOOL: Fireworks erupt over the water as a light show illuminates the Blackpool Tower\nEDINBURGH: Sisters Sophie (left) and Scarlett Strang (right) smile during Hogmanay celebrations\nEDINBURGH: University students from Japan pose with placards that spell out ‘2024’ in front of Edinburgh Castle\nPulp on stage in Princes Street Gardens as the world famous street party with 50,000 revellers attend Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Celebrations\nIn Newcastle’s Quayside crowds were treated to BAFTA award-winning artist Seb Lee-Delisle’s new Laser Light City laser show, which was projected onto the Baltic Flour Mills.\nRevellers also gathered in anticipation of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay firework display as musicians hyped the crowd up for an evening of entertainment.\nThousands of people are at the sold out Princes Garden Street Party and Concert in the Gardens in what mark’s the festival’s 30th anniversary.\nThe event, organised by UniqueAssembly and City of Edinburgh Council, will be headlined by Pulp, who have not played in the city in 20 years. Following their set, the fireworks will begin at midnight and will end at around 00.50am on Monday.\nAlex MacDonald, 26, said he is most excited for Pulp and the fireworks. He told the PA news agency: ‘I’m heavy looking forward to Pulp, like – it’s gonna be smashing. ‘The fireworks will be phenomenal man. It’ll be brilliant. We’ll have a heavy bevy to that, ken what I’m saying?’\nDave Reed, also 26, said he is ‘here for the tunes and everything else that’s happening’.\nHe added: ‘I’m well excited for the fireworks, it’s gonna be everything. ‘That’s what Edinburgh is all about, and that’s what Hogmanay is all about.’\nAhead of the main display, there were some small firework displays between different musical sets, much to the applause of the hyped-up crowd.\nCommenting on the news of a sell-out, Al Thomson, co-director of UniqueAssembly, said: ‘We’re in for one hell of a party now. Fifty thousand people in the streets of Edinburgh enjoying good music, good company, and one of the best fireworks displays in the world – there’s no better way to start the new year.\n‘We started things off right with the Torchlight Procession on Friday, where we saw 20,000 people come together to shine a light on homelessness, raising money for our charity partner Social Bite; and this is just the perfect end to the year and the best way to celebrate 30 years of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay.’\nHowever, not every planned event took place this evening, with Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland and a Devon town’s fireworks display both cancelled.\nA yellow weather warning for wind is in place for Britain’s entire southern coastline and south Wales.\nNEWCASTLE: Revellers brave the rain as they head for a night on the town in Newcastle\nNEWCASTLE: A pair of well-prepared revellers hold their umbrellas aloft as they walk through Newcastle city centre\nLEEDS: Two girls give a male reveller a peck on the cheek ahead of the last night out of the year\nLEEDS: A pair of ladies pose for the camera in Leeds city centre on New Year’s Eve\nLEEDS: A group of ladies take cover from the rain in Leeds under an umbrella as they head out to celebrate New Year\nBLACKPOOL: Spectacular fireworks erupt over the water next to Blackpool Tower as the iconic venue lights up for New Years\nLIVERPOOL: Revellers smile as they dart through the rain in a bid to reach the clubs and bars in Liverpool city centre\nLIVERPOOL: A pair of ladies cover their heads with jackets in a bid to stay dry this evening\nEDINBURGH: Brandon Fernandes and partner Tylo Verreynne embrace as they celebrate Hogmanay\nNEWCASTLE: A spectacular light show takes place at the Baltic Flour Mills in Newcastle’s Quayside\nNEWCASTLE: Crowds gather in front of the Baltic Flour Mills in Newcastle’s Quayside\nLONDON: Rain falls over the Houses of Parliament ahead of the New Year’s Eve fireworks\nNEWCASTLE: Revellers brave the rain and cold weather to enjoy the New Years Eve celebrations\nEDINBURGH: Visitors from Spain dress up in Santa hats ahead of Hogmanay New Year celebrations\nEDINBURGH: Partygoers get ready for a fun night ahead during the Hogmanay Street party celebrations\nEDINBURGH: A man and woman pose for the cameras after picking up some food during the Hogmanay New Year celebration\nEDINBURGH: Tourists from Brazil dress up in kilts for the Hogmanay New Year celebrations\nWhile the north west has been slapped with a rain warning with heavy downpours expected across Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Blackpool, Blackburn, and West Yorkshire.\nSaturday’s Eurostar cancellations hit one family who were hoping to make it back to Britain in time for New Years, after they were stranded in Brussels following a surprise trip for a Canadian relative.\nLuke Gibbs, 32, from Kenley, south London, travelled with his wife, Kyla, cousin Liam Eton and sister-in-law Brea Melanson, from Canada, and planned to arrive in London in time for New Year’s Eve celebrations on Sunday.\nMr Gibbs, a business development manager, paid £600 for a New Year’s Eve event in London Bridge, which is not refundable and now he cannot attend after his train from Brussels to St Pancras was cancelled. He described the communication with Eurostar as ‘appalling’.\n‘I think the way (Eurostar) dealt with it is pretty appalling in terms of not trying to say ‘this is how you rebook it, we’ll help you out with expenses’,’ Mr Gibbs told the PA news agency.\n‘They just said, ‘unfortunately, it’s cancelled, we’re sorry, get on with it’, which is shocking really.’\nOrganisers of Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland took the ‘very difficult decision’ to rip up its plans for New Year’s Eve tonight because of the expected stormy winds.\n‘As much as we are very disappointed and frustrated, your safety comes first, as well as ours, and we can’t possibly take the risk,’ they said as they confirmed those who had bought tickets will be fully refunded.\nElsewhere, Barnstaple, in Devon, cancelled its annual fireworks because of the ‘horrendous’ weather, reported Devon Live.\nBarnstaple Town Centre Management said it axed the display for safety reasons.\nWIGAN: Clubbers brave the cold and wet weather as they hit the city centre on New Year’s Eve\nLONDON: Met Police officers have descended on the capital ahead of New Year’s celebrations\nEDINBURGH: Fireworks explode during the New Year celebrations in Scotland\nEDINBURGH: Fireworks explode over Edinburgh Castle during the street party for Hogmanay New Year celebrations\nNEWCASTLE: A reveller gives his pal a piggyback as they enjoy the New Year’s Eve celebrations\nNEWCASTLE: Two friends strike a pose as they hit the town amid the cold and stormy conditions\nLEEDS: Partygoers did not let the grim weather dampen their spirits as they see in the New Year together\nThey said: ‘Unfortunately due to the weather conditions and the gusting winds we will be unable to do the fireworks this evening due to safety.\n‘We know this is disappointing, but safety is always the priority and we unfortunately can’t control the weather.’\nTemperatures are set to plummet on New Year’s Day and in January increasing the chance of sleet and snow on higher grounds in the north, with frosty mornings for many.\nWeather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: ‘There are growing signs of cold weather developing as we head through the first half of January.\n‘The chance of a significant cold spell is quite high.\n‘The highest risk of snow will probably be in the North and East. But if low pressure pushes up from the southwest, this would lead to the possibility of snow as weather fronts move northeast.’",

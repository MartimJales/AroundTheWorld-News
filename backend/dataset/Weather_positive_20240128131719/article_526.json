Organisers finished checks on the pyrotechnics with more than 10,000 fireworks shooting up into the night’s sky after the Big Ben countdown.The march of midnight from time zone to time zone brought the new year first to places like Australia, where more than 1 million people watched a pyrotechnic display centred around Sydney ’s famous Opera House and harbour bridge — a number of spectators equivalent to one in five of the city’s residents.Happy New Year from all at The Independent.

It was the strongest police presence Berlin witnessed in decades.On Sunday night, police banned the use of traditional firecrackers across the city.Both the city’s mayor and Germany’s interior minister had vowed a zero-tolerance strategy towards rioters, particularly any trying to attack officers.Berlin’s top security official, Iris Spanger, wrote on social media platform X, formerly Twitter: “It turned out that the many months of preparation by police and firefighters ... have paid off.”She condemned “every single act of violence”, saying “every injured colleague is one too many”.The New Year party in front of the landmark Brandenburg Gate in BerlinThe New Year party in front of the landmark Brandenburg Gate in BerlinThe Prime Minister has been criticised for using one of his first messages of 2024 to announce a ban on overseas students bringing their family to the UK.The Home Secretary said the ban, which affects all but those enrolling on postgraduate research courses and ones with Government-funded scholarships, will cut migration by tens of thousands.The measures were announced in May by his ousted predecessor Suella Braverman shortly before official figures showed net migration running at 672,000.The move could hit universities which rely on foreign student fees and could also harm the UK’s reputation as an international destination, experts have warned.It means that as of Monday, international students starting courses in Britain are no longer allowed to obtain visas for their dependants, unless they are on a postgraduate research programme or a Government-sponsored course.Watch live as Italians dive into the icy waters of the Tiber River in Rome to celebrate New Year on Monday, January 1.The tradition of jumping into the river on New Year’s Day dates back to 1946.It was started by an unemployed lifeguard who was trying to find work as a stuntman and decided to jump into the waters from the bridge to advertise his skills.The 31-year-old rapper took to the stage in Miami for the show at the Fontainebleau hotel as planned but told fans she had been struggling with illness.In a video on her Instagram story before the New Year’s Eve show, she said: “I am fighting for my life right now. I’m literally fighting for my life right now.“Soon as I landed in Miami bro… I’ve been telling people I am allergic to Miami. I’m allergic to Florida. I’m allergic to this state. Like I’m allergic to this state.“It doesn’t even make no sense. Like, as soon as I landed four hours later, I felt a little cough, my chest started getting tight.“Well, I’ve been fighting for three days and I have a huge performance later. Huge performance, like I get that it’s New Year’s but I have this huge performance. And I’m fighting, fighting.”The musician was joined on the bill for the US celebration of the new year by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who performed in New York.Also in the line-up were Ellie Goulding, Janelle Monae, 30 Seconds To Mars and Renee Rapp.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

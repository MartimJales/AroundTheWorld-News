    "text": "The Northern Lights could be visible in parts of the UK tonight\nStargazers and space enthusiasts in the UK will be pleased to know that tonight (January 2), they may be able to see the Northern Lights. Depending on where you live, you may catch a glimpse of the incredible night-time display.\nFor some areas, the colourful phenomena will likely be much more visible and easier to spot. Predominantly the northern lights are best witnessed in Scotland, North England, North Wales and Northern Ireland. However under severe space weather conditions, the lights can be seen throughout the UK.\nIt comes as, according to experts, this time of year is the best for seeing Aurora Borealis, with chances tonight being high thanks to a solar flare. As explained by the Met Office’s space weather centre, there is a chance of moderate and strong flares tonight – as well as the chance of a G1 minor storm – thanks to a hole in the surface of the sun.\nThe best conditions to view the lights are when the sky is dark and clear of any clouds. In general, the best times are between midnight and 2am, but geomagnetic activity can happen at any time. So in terms of where exactly the best possible places in Britain are, experts at LeaseCar.uk have shared the top seven locations.\n1. Isle of Anglesey, Wales The largest island in Wales will likely host the Northern Lights over winter as they’ve been consistently on display over the last few years. They’ve also been spotted in Gwynedd, Conwy and Denbighshire.\n2. Sandsend, Yorkshire Yorkshire was treated to the Northern Lights in early December with photos being taken from back gardens. The lack of street lights in Sandsend makes it easier to spot the colourful lights without them being covered by artificial lighting.\n3. Lake District, Cumbria The Northern Lights have been spotted in the heart of the Lake District. The clear skies over Cumbria will make it easier to spot the lights and witness a starry night. Grizedale Forest has been named one of the best spots to get a glimpse of the Aurora Borealis.\n4. Whitley Bay, North Tyneside The Northern Lights were not long spotted in Whitley Bay back in October 2023, with photos being taken near St Mary’s Lighthouse. They’ll likely make an appearance once again and will be easier to spot as the nights draw in earlier.\n5. Arthur’s Seat, Edinburgh Arthur’s Hill is an extinct volcano that’s located in Holyrood Park. It’s one of the most popular spots in Scotland for people to go hiking. Be prepared for a steep walk to the summit as it can take almost two hours to reach the peak. If you end up missing the Northern Lights, you’ll still get to witness a breathtaking view of Edinburgh.\n6. Shetland Islands, Scotland The greenish, purple glow is likely to be spotted in the Shetland Islands. It’s one of the most likely places to spot them throughout the whole of winter, but make sure to visit when it’s a clear night sky.\n7. Donegal, Ireland Donegal has been named one of the best places in Ireland to get a clear view of the Aurora Borealis. The chances of spotting them are better when there’s no rain and the moon is shining brightly.\nTips for seeing the aurora You need a clear night with no cloud cover Find a dark location with no light pollution Look toward the northern horizon Be cautious that geomagnetic activity can cause disturbances to satellite navigation (GNSS/GPS etc).",

    "text": "Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital adopted 53 baby egret birds after [wild storms on Australia's east coast](/story/8473399/) in late December destroyed their homes. $1/ (min cost $8) Login or signup to continue reading The chicks were roosting in a tree at Lake Alfred near [Gympie](/story/8472433/) in Queensland when torrential rain and damaging winds destroyed their nest causing the birds to fall with some sustaining \"severe injuries\". A passerby saw the stranded and injured birds while on a walk and contacted an animal rescue group. Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital doctor Tamsyn Stephenson said \"these chicks are amongst the cutest babies I have ever seen, and although it is very sad to think of what they have been through, we are so honoured to be able to give them a second chance at life\". \"The majority of these chicks are very fortunate to not sustain any life-threatening injuries, but they will still be closely monitored over the next 48 hours,\" she said. Australia Zoo said the birds were quickly rescued from Lake Alfred and \"the majority were lucky to survive\". Their ages ranged from \"just a few days old to a couple of months\" but were all too small to survive on their own, Australia Zoo said. \"When they are old enough, the chicks will be released in the same spot they were found. It is truly the best part of our jobs, seeing an animal get a second chance,\" Dr Stephenson said. More than 40 chicks were deemed healthy enough to be rehabilitated by local wildlife carers while a few \"require more love and care from the veterinarians and nurses and will remain at the hospital for the time being\".

The National Weather Service is also reporting 7” of snow from the last storm at 6,582 ft in Lovell Summit, 10” around 7,046 ft in Kyle Canyon & 11” totals at 8,626 ft, 8,890 ft and 7,860 ft in elevation on Mt. Charleston.{/p}{p}TODAY: We're waking up to a few clouds this morning with wall to wall sunshine anticipated this afternoon.

The strongest winds will happen in the northwest valley today.{/p}{p}Air quality is ranked 'good' and pollen levels remain low.{/p}{p}TONIGHT: Skies will go from clear this evening to partly cloudy overnight with valley low temperatures dropping to the mid and upper 30s. Winds will also gradually back down through the evening to northwest breezes 5-15 mph.{/p}{p}YOUR 7 DAY: A storm system will move in over the Intermountain West region with little impact expected locally. Breezes will pick up slightly on Friday afternoon in the valley around 5-15 mph with wind gusts up to around 20 mph.{/p}{p}Our next weathermaker is a much stronger storm diving south over the weekend. It looks like this storm will mostly be a wind event for our area. Weather models aren't completely in sync with the movement of the next storm but show the potential of more mountain snow on the way with an estimated 2\\\"-4\\\" additional inches of snow on the mountains.

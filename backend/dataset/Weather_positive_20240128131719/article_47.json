    "text": "If you’ve felt like this has been a historically mild December, you’d be right. Osoyoos set a new temperature record for Dec. 28, with a balmy 6.9 C. According to Environment Canada’s weather summaries, the old record for this day was 6.2 C, set in 1994. Records in this area have been kept since 1954. In Penticton, on Dec. 28, it’s sitting at 7 C. Every day of December hovered around 5 C. Last year, Okanagan Lake was frozen over at the shoreline. This year, it looks like spring. Even Kevin, the famous broken-winged goose is finding it balmy. Old School Penticton posted a picture of Kevin hanging out with some feathered friends and he captioned the photo, “The King & Queen have their very own island. It ain’t Hawaii, but we’ve all been invited to the Lūʻau. It’s B.Y.O.P. (Bring Your Own Pineapple).” Penticton Golf and Country Club is still open, with many members able to hit the greens every day of this month. According to the weather forecasts, the South Okanagan will finish out 2023 a little colder but it won’t dip below 0 C during the day. Jan. 1, New Year’s Day looks to be great weather to take the Polar Bear Dip. Daytime temperatures will be around 1 C. [READ MORE: Snow for Xmas Day?

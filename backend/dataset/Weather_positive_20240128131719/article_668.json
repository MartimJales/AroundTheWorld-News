    "text": "Arina Rodionova has claimed the scalp of one-time Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin in an energy-sapping 7-5 7-6 (9-7) win at the Brisbane International.\nThe 34-year-old Australian needed a wildcard to compete at the event but is through to the round of 16 after thwarting and frustrating world No.37 Kenin at every turn at Pat Rafter Arena on Tuesday.\nApologising to fans for clogging up the court and delaying their chance to see Rafael Nadal on his return from injury, the world No.113 outlasted an errant Kenin in a near two-and-a-half hour battle royale.\nRodionova – Australia’s highest-ranked female player – sounded a warning when she broke 2020 Australian Open Champion Kenin in the first set.\nDespite Kenin breaking back Rodionova was able to hang on to take the set.\nBut the ding-dong head to head was typified by the gripping seventh game of the second set which lasted 17 minutes.\nKenin had broken Rodionova’s serve and looked to be on her way to squaring the match and sending it to a third set.\nThe Australian gave Kenin a scare but was left to rue her failure to convert eight break points with her American opponent going 5-2 up.\nHowever, Kenin won the battle and Rodionova the war, with the Australian holding serve either side of a break to force a tiebreak where she calmly eked out victory.\nArina Rodionova thanked fans for their support but playfully said she won’t share her prize money. (Jono Searle/AAP PHOTOS)\n“I’m a little speechless,” Rodionova said before turning to the crowd in Brisbane.\n“I only won because of you guys … but if you think I’m going to share my prize money with you, it’s not happening.\n“It was a great match and I really enjoyed being there … I know you guys are waiting for Rafa tonight but I’m sorry you had to suffer with us.”\nRodionova will play the winner of Liudmila Samsonova and Mirra Andreeva.\nBad weather delayed the start to many of Tuesday’s matches in both the men’s and women’s draw in Brisbane, with former world No.1 Victoria Azarenka in action along with the all-Australian tie between Olivia Gadecki and Kimberly Birrell.",

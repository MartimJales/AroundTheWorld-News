    "text": "De’Aaron Fox scored 31 points, hitting seven 3-pointers in the second half, and Domantas Sabonis added 25 points to help the visiting Sacramento Kings overcome a 23-point deficit en route to a 117-110 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday.\nThe Kings took their first lead, 106-105, with 5:48 remaining on a 3-pointer by Fox. After the game was tied 110-110, Chris Duarte sank a 3-pointer, Sabonis made 1 of 2 free throws and Keegan Murray hit a jumper to give Sacramento a six-point lead with 49 seconds left. Atlanta did not score in the final 4 1/2 minutes.\nFox finished 10-for-20 from the field, 8-for-16 on 3-point attempts, and added six rebounds, eight assists and four steals. Sabonis was 12-for-17 from the field and had 10 rebounds and seven assists. Trey Lyles added 19 points and Malik Monk had 15 for the Kings, who had dropped three of their previous four games.\nAtlanta got 24 points and nine assists from Trae Young and 18 points from Dejounte Murray. Jalen Johnson had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and Saddiq Bey netted 15 points for the Hawks, who have lost four in a row.\nThe Kings ended their four-game losing streak to Atlanta. The teams meet again Jan. 22 in Sacramento.\nThe Hawks raced to a 31-8 lead on a Murray 3-pointer and led 36-23 at the end of the first quarter. But the Kings, who missed their first seven 3-pointers, began to find the range and cut the deficit to 48-43 on a 3-pointer by Keegan Murray midway through the second period.\nAtlanta finished the half on a 15-6 run and led 71-53 at the break.\nFox scored 13 in the third quarter and the Kings outscored the Hawks 33-20, cutting Atlanta’s lead to 91-86 entering the fourth quarter. Fox hit a 3-pointer to make a two-point game, only to have the Hawks go on an 11-2 run to restore an 11-point lead at 102-91.\nBoth teams play again on Sunday. The Hawks travel to Washington, and the Kings complete their three-game road trip in Memphis.\n–Field Level Media",

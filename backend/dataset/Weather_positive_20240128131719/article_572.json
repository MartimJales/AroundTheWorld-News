    "text": "December 31, 2023 at 10:49 AM\nBy Pam S\nPam S\nDecember weather in Michigan has been awesome, that is for Michigan weather standards. Got a number of rounds in for the month. Played yesterday (12/30/2023) with three guys. We were partnered and playing best ball match play. On #16, my partner dumped his shot into the water, the only water hole on the course. Feeling a slight bit of pressure, I took out my driver and my ball landed on the green. It was about a 155 yard drive from the #4 tees. My first thought was hoping to make a birdie putt so we could win the hole. The four of us were talking as we approached the green and as I started looking for my ball, I couldn't see it on the green. I thought, \"oh great, it rolled off into the rough.\" Then one of the guys said, \"I think it went into the hole!\" And.....sure enough.....there it was in the hole.\nThe course was Traverse City Golf and Country Club. Probably the only hole-in-one on the course in December. Of course, not many rounds are played in December in Traverse City.\nSign In\nHaven't registered for Team Titleist yet?\nSign Up\nWe've sent you an email with the information needed to reset your password.

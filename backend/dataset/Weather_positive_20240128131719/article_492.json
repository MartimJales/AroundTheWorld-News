Learn more .\nPhoto: amazon\nGrowing up, I used to get so upset when the weather would get cold enough that my mom would start pulling out the winter essentials . You know the ones: scratchy sweaters, itchy tights, thermal leggings, and, worst of all, constricting turtlenecks. It took many years post-childhood for me to realize that these winter must-haves can be just as comfortable as they are warm.\nSo when I discovered Kindcall’s Thermal Long-Sleeve Turtleneck Top had over 2,500 five-star ratings with raving reviews to match , it was an immediate add to cart. I haven’t stopped wearing the thermal since it came into my possession, and I plan to pick up a few colors while they’re nearly 60 percent off.\nThe thermal top comes in 17 colors, including black, orange, white, purple, and green, plus sizes XS through XXL. If you’re looking to stock up, there’s also the option of buying a pack of two for $24. It has a snug, close-to-the-body fit thanks to an immense amount of stretch in the lightweight fabric that has an internal fleece lining for added warmth. The turtleneck collar is tall enough to wear scrunched or folded without feeling constricting around the neck, while an elongated hemline falls right at the hip.\nKindcall Thermal Long-Sleeve Turtleneck Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $13 $12 What I love most about the Kindcall thermal turtleneck is its versatility and quality at such a great price. The inner fleece lining is unbelievably soft and makes you feel like you’re being wrapped in a warm blanket, but it’s still breathable enough that you won’t overheat. It has a ton of stretch, making it easy to pop the turtleneck over your head without constricting around the neck. The fabric smooths effortlessly around the body, so it’s super flattering, bulk-free, and holds its shape well after several washes.\nIt also makes for a great layerable staple on its own. I’ve styled it casually under crewnecks and flannels with leggings or mom jeans, and also dressed it up with a pair of black faux leather pants and boots. I’ve even worn it skiing under my suit and was able to stay warm in 20-degree temperatures. This is a non-negotiable in my closet, and I’m telling everyone who’ll listen about it.\nShop more colors of the Kindcall Thermal Long-Sleeve Turtleneck Top while it’s on sale for just $12 at Amazon.

    "text": "Business resumes as long awaited snowfall makes way at Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort Snow is finally piling on the trees and hills here at the Dodge Ridge Mountain Resort. Apryle Rivera, the marketing coordinator for the resort, described two different pictures. On Tuesday, there was dirt showing. On Wednesday: white and fluffy snow. After weeks of anticipation but no snow, staff say it’s the long-awaited snowfall that they needed to begin operations for the winter season. \"It's a little bit of a later winter than normal, but it's California and you never know what's going to happen,” staff member Ethan Sandberg said. “We're just excited to see some snow and be able to get out on the mountain.\" Justin Turner is a visitor from Florida who said he was also waiting for the snow to fall at Dodge Ridge. “We were concerned because when we showed up in Sacramento, there was no snow. I thought it was just going to be cold and rainy,” Turner said. On Wednesday, several families and children enjoyed playing in the powdery snow as they carried on with private ski and snowboarding lessons. With at least 15 inches of snow so far, staff say they’ll be able to open more activities the more snow they get starting on Friday. “We don’t know what’s going to be open exactly. We’re going to find out in the next day or so, but we are going to offer some skiing, snowboarding, probably have some private lessons and group lessons for the kids,” Sandberg said. “We’ll probably have some snow play and tubing going on, too.” The resort will be closed on Thursday as staff conduct preparations for their weekend opening. “This weekend, we hope to have the lifts spinning, and a good portion of the mountain open. Our mountain operations are assessing right now,” Rivera said. The resort will open Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Visitors are advised to check for weather and safety updates before making the drive over.

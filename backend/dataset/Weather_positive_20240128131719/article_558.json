    "text": "Brandon Weatherz: Easing nicely into 2024\nThe weather is taking it easy on us as we turn the corner into a new year. Our Monday starts off with mostly cloudy skies and temps in teens to low 20s. Early clouds give way to sunshine today and a breezy southwest wind sends milder air our way with highs topping off in upper 20s and low 30s. Temperatures remain above average tonight with lows mostly in the 20s. Clouds gradually increase overnight with grayer conditions settling in on Tuesday. Highs manage upper 20s to low 30s once more, then a passing cold front brings a breezy northwest wind and introduces cooler air that hangs around the rest of the week. Even so, temps will consistently be near to a touch above average.\nOur Monday stays dry. We look along the international border for light snow late Monday night into Tuesday morning with little to no accumulation expected. Tuesday evening and overnight brings another round of scattered light snow showers moving in from Canada staying mostly north of Duluth. Accumulation in these northern areas remains minimal, under an inch. We look to the South Shore Tuesday night and Wednesday for lake effect snow. Widespread accumulation here is also under an inch, with a localized 1-3â€³ found in northern Iron County and Gogebic County. This minimal round of snow is all we have until a stretch of low snow chances arrive Friday night and continue each day through the weekend.\nToday: Mostly cloudy in the morning, then becoming mostly sunny in the afternoon. Breezy. High 31. SW wind 10-15 mph.\nTonight: Mostly clear to start with increasing clouds late. Breezy. Low 23. WSW wind 10-15 mph.\nTomorrow: Cloudy and breezy. High 31. WNW wind 10-15 mph.\nTomorrow night: Cloudy with a slight chance for snow. Low 18. WNW wind 5-15 mph.\nWednesday: Mostly sunny and breezy. High 24. NNW wind 10-15 mph.\nThursday: Partly cloudy. High 25. SW wind 5-15 mph.\nFriday: Mostly cloudy. High 26. S wind becoming N 5-10 mph.\nSaturday: Cloudy with a chance for snow. High 27. SE wind 5-10 mph. Chance of snow: 30%\nSunday: Cloudy with a chance for snow. High 26. E wind 5-10 mph. Chance of snow: 30%",

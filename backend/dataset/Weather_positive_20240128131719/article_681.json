    "text": "Many of us wish for warm and sunny weather on days off\nEight bank holidays are in store for the people of England and Wales in 2024. Many people like to take advantage and organise their time off work around the bank holidays that come throughout the year, so you may want to take note of the dates.\nIf a bank holiday falls on a weekend, a “substitute” weekday then assumes bank holiday status. This is usually the first Monday that precedes the bank holiday.\nNot everyone gets to enjoy bank holidays, though, as employers do not have to give their employees paid leave on bank or public holidays. Bank holidays may also affect how and when your benefits are paid, as reported by the Liverpool Echo.\nFull list of bank holidays in 2024 in England and Wales: Monday, January 1 – New Year’s Day Friday, March 29 – Good Friday Monday, April 1 – Easter Monday Monday, May 6 – Early May bank holiday Monday, May 27 – Spring bank holiday Monday, August 26 – Summer bank holiday Wednesday, December 25 – Christmas Day Thursday, December 26 – Boxing Day Click here for more employment news from BristolLive.",

    "text": "Yahoo News UK Heroic dad who saved mum and child from sinking car during Storm Henk acted on ‘instinct’ Liam Stych, 28, leapt into the raging water in Birmingham after hearing the woman screaming. Read full article Jimmy Nsubuga 3 January 2024 at 6:41 pm · 4-min read\nWatch: Hero dad describes saving woman and girl, three, from trapped sinking car\nA dad who helped save a woman and her three-year-old daughter from a sinking car during Storm Henk has said he acted on “instinct” after being hailed a “local hero”.\nLiam Stych, 28, leapt into the raging torrent after hearing the woman screaming: “Help me, help me, please save my baby.\" Dramatic video shows the woman’s Fiat Punto being dragged under a footbridge as floods surged through Hall Green in Birmingham on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe fearless dad dangled off the bridge, smashed the rear passenger window and used ratchet straps to attach the woman’s car to railings to stop it sinking. Incredibly, he saved the little girl by \"hurling\" her into the lap of his pregnant partner Tia Draper, 27, who was standing on the bridge.\nWest Midlands Police hailed Liam a “local hero”, but the modest dad-of-two played down the incident.\nStych said: “It was pure luck that we were there when it happened. I didn't think about what I was doing, I just acted on instinct. The poor lady has lost her car and her shopping which was in the back but she and her daughter could have lost their lives.”\nLiam Stych and his partner Tia Draper. (SWNS) Stych, who has two children from a previous relationship, said he wanted people to understand the lethal danger of floods. He added: “I think if I hadn’t done what I did the car would have been dragged under the bridge and there would have been no way of getting them out.”\nHe continued: “I just managed to stay calm and thought clearly about what needed to be done. I didn’t want to make the situation worse by panicking and sinking the car with my weight. My only thought was to get them both out safely.”\nThe rescue While taking a walk over a bridge with his partner, Stych had heard a woman screaming from inside a car. The woman was shouting for help, asking him to save her baby who was in the backseat.\nThe front of her car was pointing downwards into the water, so he carefully dangled off the bridge without putting any more weight on the car to avoid any chances of sinking. He then advised the woman to remain calm, unwind her window and to hand over her child to him.\nStory continues Sytch added: “She was shouting ‘Help me, help me, please save my baby she’s in the back!’\nHe said: \"The woman could only get her window half-way down so I took the babbie and literally hurled her behind me and into the lap of Tia who was on the bridge.”\nMore West Mids stories - click above Liam Stych saves a woman and her child from a submerged car. (SWNS) The roadworks engineer and traffic manager then sprinted back to his work van and grabbed a set of 3.5 tonne ratchet straps, climbed back to the car and smashed the back passenger window. He secured the car to the bridge with the ratchet straps so it wouldn’t drift any further and then told the woman to climb into the back and get out the window.\nShe managed to get out and the two then held hands and just jumped together into the water after a count of three. Sytch added. He then dragged her out of the 5ft water which had a strong current and waited for the ambulance crew to arrive to check her over.\nLiam Stych leapt into the raging torrent after hearing the woman screaming. (SWNS) How long is Storm Henk going to last? While Storm Henk has passed, many areas in the UK are still struggling to cope with its aftermath. The storm caused extensive flooding and destruction, with gusts of over 90mph. As the first named storm of 2024, it brought down trees and scaffolding and caused power outages.\nNetwork Rail said transport delays would continue as train services get back on track. More than 300 flood warnings were in place across England and Wales on Wednesday morning. A severe flood alert, meaning danger to life, was in place for the River Nene in Northampton, which warned of deep and fast-flowing water at the Billing Aquadrome holiday park and nearby business parks.\nTransport delays were ongoing as commuters attempted to make their way to work on the first week back after Christmas. More rain is expected in many areas throughout the day, prompting National Highways to warn of road closures that could last for several hours\nRecommended reading Wind rips London Eye pod hatch open while 400ft in air with family inside (The Guardian)\nMotorist killed by falling tree as Storm Henk batters UK with 90mph winds (PA)\nResidents ‘fear the worst’ after being evacuated due to Storm Henk flooding (PA)\nTRENDING Kanye West slammed for explicit snaps of Bianca Censori after 'shaming' ex Kim Kardashian for 'showing body' Evening Standard · 3-min read Brendan O’Carroll shares vow with fans after Mrs Brown’s Boys backlash The Independent · 3-min read Strictly’s Dan Walker announces \"massive\" career move Digital Spy · 2-min read Turkey blocks Royal Navy minehunters going to Ukraine The Telegraph · 3-min read Convicted killer admits to more murders on his death bed The Independent · 2-min read",

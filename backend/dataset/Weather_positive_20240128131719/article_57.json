    "text": "Jupiter outside hitter Sarah Brodner enjoyed an impressive senior season and led the Warriors to the Class 7A state semifinal. Brodner, a University of Virginia signee, was selected as the Sun Sentinel’s Palm Beach County girls volleyball 7A-6A player of the year.\nThe team captain led the Warriors to a 25-4 record as they captured a district and regional championship. Brodner led the team in kills and was a top performer throughout the season. She recorded 10 kills during a regional final victory in three sets. She also stepped up with 15 kills in the state semifinal.\nBrodner said her high school career was memorable, which included an undefeated run during the regular season and playoffs prior to a state semifinal loss during her sophomore season.\n“It definitely felt great to make it back to states,” Brodner said. “It was our entire goal all season. We did not get too ahead of ourselves. We were focused on each game. It was great to win the regional on our home court. I wanted to be a great leader to the younger girls throughout the season. It’s been great the last four years. It’s a family to me.”\nBrodner also has competed at the club level for several years, including with Jupiter Elite.\n“I was able to develop my skills playing against older girls who were stronger and faster and it has helped me a lot,” she said. “I was playing against Division I players.”\nBrodner said she enjoys the opportunity to compete and scrimmage against her sister at club practice. Ella is sophomore standout outside hitter at Jupiter Christian. Brodner said she will also be able to help her younger sister navigate the recruiting process in high school.\nBrodner, who is ranked fifth in the state in her class by Prep Dig, is looking forward to the opportunity to play at the University of Virginia.\n“I had to be really dedicated to get to the next level,” she said. “There is no skipping practice, workouts and tournaments. One of my biggest strengths is my mental game. I am super excited to be able to go to college and take a bigger step. I love the girls, coaches and the campus. It’s a great academic school. I found my home there.”\nSarah Brodner Jupiter High School Volleyball player of the year photographed on Wednesday November 15, 2023. (Mike Stocker/South ",

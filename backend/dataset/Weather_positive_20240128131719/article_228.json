    "text": "With temperatures expected to hover to freezing levels, MUST Ministries has opened its winter warming shelter through Jan. 4. The Hope House Shelter is located at 1297 Bells Ferry Road in Marietta, just off Cobb Parkway. The Cobb County government is partnering with MUST to provide transportation to the shelter. People needing to utilize the shelter can be picked up at Reflections of Trinity, located at 4037 Austell-Powder Springs Road in Powder Springs. Pick up times are 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Bus vouchers for the shelter are available from 1-3 p.m. at three different locations in Cobb County – the HOPE Family Resource Center, 6108 Mableton Parkway, Suite 116 in Mableton; Family Life Restoration Center, 6105 Mableton Parkway in Mableton; and Bethany United Methodist Church, 760 Hurt Rd. SW in Smyrna. According to the National Weather Service, low temperatures Friday night until Wednesday night will hover around freezing levels. Forecasters with the National Weather Service have predicted Friday's low temperature to be 32 degrees, Saturday's low is 29, Sunday's low is 36, the low for Monday and Tuesday is 30 and Wednesday's low is 35.

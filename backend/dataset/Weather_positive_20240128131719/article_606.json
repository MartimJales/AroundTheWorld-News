    "text": "New Mexico is a beautiful state. Its landscapes will leave you breathless everywhere you look. It just makes sense why the state is called The Land of Enchantment . The indigenous culture and history, the colorful gemstones, the cactus-filled deserts, the deep caverns, the stunning snowy mountains in winter — everything about New Mexico is enchanting. But does it snow in New Mexico? Yes, it does snow in New Mexico. Usually, the snowy season starts in November and ends in March. The northern and central parts of the state get the most amounts of snowfall, but anywhere in the state where the elevation is higher will get snow. The snowiest place in New Mexico is Red River. Let’s take a look at where most of the snow in New Mexico takes place, the average amounts, temperatures, and more. Believe it or not, the place in New Mexico that got snow at the earliest time was in Estancia on September 24, 1913. ©Roschetzky Photography/Shutterstock.com The average amount of snow that New Mexico gets depends on the region you are in. For example, the northern, mountainous regions of New Mexico will get snow often. In the south, like the desert areas and the plains of the state, you can expect to get about 3 inches per year. In the mountainous areas of New Mexico, you can expect to see somewhere between 100 to 300 inches of snow every year. The table shows the average amount of snow for Red River, NM, during the colder months between November and March. As you can see, February, on average, gets the most snow per year. During winter, New Mexico isn’t too cold, but it isn’t warm either. Winters can get to around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. But in the northern and central parts of the state, the temperatures can go way down and some parts can even experience freezing temperatures. The months of December, January, and February are usually the coldest of the year — with an average of 18 degrees to 43 degrees. When it comes to records, the city of Gavilan recorded -50 degrees on February 1, 1951. The snowiest place in New Mexico is Red River, which is located in Northern New Mexico. ©Roschetzky Photography/Shutterstock.com Usually, the snowiest places in New Mexico are located in the northern part of the state, as well as the central part of the state. The snowiest place in New Mexico is Red River , located above Taos, NM. It snows an average of 62 days every year with over 40 inches of snow. Other snowy places in the state include Santa Fe , which snows about 22 inches every year, and Taos, and the areas surrounding the city. The biggest snowstorm in New Mexico’s history was recorded in Socorro County with a whopping 41 inches. ©Jeff Kingma/iStock via Getty Images Like all Southwestern states, New Mexico is a very biodiverse state . There are deserts, mountains, and everything that you can imagine in this land of enchantment. You can also find a variety of animals that can be unique to New Mexico. The animals that you can spot in the state include Bighorn sheep, cougars, deer, and ibexes. If you look up, you may be able to see Eurasian collared doves and other birds. New Mexico’s winter animals include many species of geese, more than you would ever imagine like Arctic snow geese and even sandhill cranes. And there you have it, it does snow in New Mexico. The snow that occurs in New Mexico is usually centralized in the northern part of the state. However even though it is unlikely, there has been snow reported in other parts of New Mexico. Usually where the elevation is higher and the temperatures are lower is where you will find the most snow. As you drive down the highway to go to the snowiest place in New Mexico, look around you and see the beauty of the state. The post Does It Snow in New Mexico?

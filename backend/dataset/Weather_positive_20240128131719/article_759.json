For the first time, the Pro Gast Tourismus association offered a fire show at the Ammergauer Haus. In principle, this was well received, but there is room for improvement.\nOberammergau – Sparks fly from a guitar. Men juggle torches while flaming fountains shoot into the air. Film music blares out of the speakers, as well as classics like \"We will rock you\" by Queen. The main thing is that the piece has bums. In keeping with the dull thud, Philgor's team takes the audience into the world of fire. Impresses with artistically hot choreographies and LED interludes on the truss scaffolding.\nBut there is a shadow over the luminous, half-hour performance on Monday evening. Many of the onlookers can hardly see them or not at all, so some leave them early.\nVery good response For the first time, the tourist office Pro Gast organized a fire show. As a replacement for the popular professional fireworks. Since 2012, this had attracted numerous guests and locals to the sports grounds on New Year's Day. With Corona, the event died, but mainly for noise and environmental reasons. An alternative was needed. With Philgor from Munich, the association landed fire professionals. \"The response was very good,\" says Thomas Knöpfle, the second chairman, when asked by Tagblatt. Despite minimal advertising.\nIn advance, the association could not estimate how many people would make a pilgrimage to the spa gardens. In the end, there were around 800, Knöpfle estimates. More than expected. \"It was jam-packed.\" On the one hand, this speaks in favor of the event, but on the other hand, it raised a problem. People were glued to each other to catch a glimpse of the flaming spectacle. This was primarily reserved for the front rows. What was going on in front of the stage of the pavilion could only be guessed at by those at the back. The result: disgruntled visitors.\nImprove your concept Knöpfle considers the event, which was supported by sponsors and the municipality, to be a success in principle, but absolutely understands the criticism. Especially for children, most of whom stood close to the stage or took a box seat on the shoulders of their parents, the fire show was a \"great experience\". In any case, it had fulfilled the ideas of the association. However, he also disliked the cramped space and limited visibility. An experience for next time.\nHe currently assumes that an event will take place there again in 2025. But then with an improved concept. Pro Gast will deal with how this could be optimized. Knöpfle's first thought experiments: install two large screens and move the stalls from the \"Ammergau Winter Magic\" so that they do not block the view additionally. He actually considers the location per se to be optimal because there are toilets, it is centrally located and within walking distance and the effort in terms of rescue services is lower.\n\"Ammergau Winter Magic\" to be continued Regardless of how and whether the club sets up an offer in the future, one thing is already certain for Maximilian Kasseckert: The \"Ammergau Winter Magic\" is to be continued. \"We definitely want to do it again,\" emphasizes the tenant of the Ammergau house. The new Christmas market in Oberammergau was well received. Apart from the fact that the stalls had to remain closed on a weekend due to the strong wind, \"we can't complain\".\nSimilar news: Garbage can in Peißenberg burns on New Year's Day 8 hours",

    "text": "- China experiences a spike in down jacket sales due to a cold wave, with high-end goose down jackets gaining popularity; Skypeople’s jacket sells for 7,000 yuan, and Bosideng’s hiking series averages over 6,000 yuan. - The market for goose down apparel surged, with sales representing 18% of total related apparel in 2022-2023, and the down jacket sector grew 34% year-on-year; the overall market reached 169.2 billion yuan in 2022. - Guvet leads the market with a 28% share in the 1,500-2,999 yuan range on Douyin and plans expansion with offline stores in partnership with Luxemporium, tapping into the trend of outdoor sports driving market growth. “` The down jacket market in China is experiencing a boom, particularly in the high-end segment, as consumers brace for the chilly weather. This surge is largely attributed to the increased spending power of Chinese consumers and their growing preference for quality and luxury in winter apparel. Price Surge in Domestic Down Clothing With the onset of winter, the demand for warm clothing has led to a spike in the prices of down jackets. A notable example is the domestic brand Skypeople, whose goose down jacket now retails for an astonishing 7,000 yuan ($979), triggering debates among netizens. Premium Brands Lead the Market Brands such as Bosideng are at the forefront of this upward trend. Their hiking series outerwear, for instance, has an average price point exceeding 6,000 yuan. Customers like Linda Yuan, who recently purchased a Bosideng down jacket for 2,800 yuan, are drawn to features such as the jacket’s lightness and quick warming capabilities. Increasing Market Share for Goose Down Jackets Goose down jackets have carved out a significant place in the market, now making up a larger percentage of total down jacket sales. This expansion reflects the rising disposable incomes and the ever-evolving tastes of Chinese consumers. - The proportion of goose down sales has jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent between 2022 and 2023. - Market growth is outpacing the general clothing industry, with the down jacket sector valued at approximately 169.2 billion yuan in 2022. Segment Growth and Market Dominance Interestingly, the sector’s growth is particularly strong in the higher-priced segments, with products over 800 yuan witnessing a 70 percent growth in sales, according to Douyin. Guvet is one brand that has capitalized on this trend, dominating sales on Douyin and planning an expansion into physical retail spaces. - Guvet leads with nearly 28 percent market share in the 1,500-2,999 yuan price range. - The brand’s Black Pearl series, priced above 2,000 yuan, tops the sales charts on Douyin. - Guvet also commands 18 percent of the market share in the 3,000 yuan price bracket. Targeting the Affluent and Plans for Expansion Guvet’s founder, Wu Kunming, states that their brand targets affluent women between the ages of 30 and 40, focusing on quality and service. With an increase in average purchase price and a loyal customer base, the brand has opened its inaugural offline pop-up store in Beijing and has plans for further expansion across China. Influence of Outdoor Sports and Competition The increased popularity of outdoor sports among the youth has also propelled the down jacket market forward, with a staggering year-on-year sales increase reported in the first three quarters. Despite facing stiff competition from international luxury brands, sportswear labels, and fast fashion outlets, domestic down jacket manufacturers are holding their ground. Changing Consumer Preferences Today’s younger Chinese consumers are well-informed and culturally savvy. They are moving away from a focus on price alone, seeking out products that offer quality and value. Wu emphasizes that in a competitive market like China’s, focusing on the product, values, and the consumer experience is key to success.",

    "text": "Another day of temperatures that are a good deal above average, despite some cooling compared to yesterday. Highs in a near-50 to mid-50s zone compare to averages in the mid-40s. If you are a fan of the mild side of seasonable, the weather ahead is for you. The pattern is a bit stagnant through the holiday weekend, though, which means there’s not a whole lot of change in day-to-day weather. Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options Through Tonight: Other than a quick sprinkle possible this evening, nothing much to think about out there overnight. Skies trend partly to mainly clear after midnight. Lows are mostly around freezing to the mid-30s. View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Saturday): Partly cloudy and pretty decent for late December. Breezy conditions are probably the main negative. Upper 40s to around 50 most spots for afternoon maximums. West winds around 10 mph gust near 20 mph. Sunday: Mostly sunny skies are a good bet much of the day. Like Saturday, mainly upper 40s to near 50 for highs. Temperatures are likely about mid-30s to near 40 for the ball drop at midnight. Monday (New Year’s Day): Partly sunny, which might be mostly sunny in the morning and mostly cloudy later on. Probably a touch cooler, with highs mainly in the mid- and upper 40s. A quick flurry or shower is possible. Winds should blow from the south and southwest. See Camden Walker’s forecast through the beginning of next week . And if you haven’t already, join us on Twitter and Gridlock . Where’s winter? Among the many warm records in recent days, Washington snagged a new one for the warm low on Thursday. It only got down to 51, which beat the old record of 50 on the date in 2008. The average high? 46. Want our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox? Subscribe here .",

    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — A widespread rain will move into Central Texas for Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday evening. There could be pockets of heavy rain and embedded storms, but we are not anticipating any issues with severe weather. This is just the first round of rain for the week, and it will likely bring a widespread quarter-inch to 1 inch of beneficial rainfall. The second round of rain will move in on Friday. Models remain in strong agreement that another system will produce widespread showers and a few embedded storms, but we won't know the exact timing for another couple of days. As a result of both of these system, we're expecting most of the KVUE area to pick up a half-inch to one and a half inches of beneficial rain over the next seven days. This pattern is looking much more typical of an El Niño winter, and we hope it continues into the back half of January to improve our ongoing drought. The KVUE Weather Team will continue to monitor this developing forecast. In the meantime, the extended forecast can be found below:",

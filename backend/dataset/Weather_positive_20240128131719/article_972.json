    "text": "The Sunday Mail Online Reporter WATER levels in Lake Kariba had by Tuesday this week had risen above last year’s levels owing to increased rainfall activity in the catchment area, raising prospects for increased allocation for power generation for both Zimbabwe and Zambia. In a post on its X handle on Wednesday, the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), which manages water in the river on behalf of the two riparian states, said the water level was measured at 477,35 metres on January 2, compared to 475,6 metres in the same period a year ago. “The lake level is rising due to increased rainfall activity on the lake and immediate catchment, closing the period under review at 477,25m (12,11 percent usable storage) on 2nd January 2024, compared to 475,63m (0,97 percent usable storage) recorded during the same date last year,” said ZRA. Last week, the authority announced that the Zimbabwe Power Company and Zambia’s ZESCO Limited would equally share 16-billion cubic metres (BCM), down from the revised 30 BCM in 2023, because of anticipated poor inflows from the lake’s catchment area.",

    "text": "With the warm, dry winter we’ve had so far this winter, I’ve taken several walks in the woods in past weeks. It’s rather a monochrome landscape, with the brown grasses, dull green pines and the craggy granite rock facings. The grasses lie drab and spent, the dead timber is exposed, and the spikes of white are the ghostly remains of wildflowers that flourished not so many months ago. The year is approaching its end.\nYet as I trudge through the matted residue, hidden in the soil underneath my feet is a living world silently preparing for the eternal rebirth of our beautiful green surface. While the world we know sleeps, underground life is busy at work, carrying out its purpose to replenish the foundational systems of our planet.\nIn fact, according to the Soil Science Society of America, more organisms live in the soil than live aboveground. Just a handful of soil contains millions of living things, all doing their part to make our environment clean, healthy and vibrant. From tiny bacteria and microorganisms to earthworms and bugs and on to underground mammals like moles and gophers, millions of organisms and thousands of species play their part in aerating the soil, decomposing dead plants and animals and creating the nutrients on which our above-ground world draws its sustenance.\nAs I take my walks, I often reflect on how timeless it all is – these living processes we think so little about that underlie our very existence. Long before we are born and long after we die, life never falters no matter how it changes course or reinvents itself. As I look up at the rock cliffs or walk around the outcroppings at my feet, I think about how even these supposedly lifeless objects have existed eons before I was born and will continue to do so eons into the future.\nPeople are also reading…\nI was joined by my husband on our latest walk in the woods as we searched and found this year’s Christmas tree. We cut it down and decorated it, so now this dead tree symbolizes the birth of Jesus and of the religion that promises eternal life to its believers. As the New Year begins, we all celebrate the rebirth of the cycle of life, even as we prepare for months of living in the depths of winter.\nFor those of us who dwell across the Northern Plains, that means at least three months before the earliest signs of spring begin to appear. Yet, as the cold and dark descend, we renew our hopes for what lies ahead. We reaffirm our ties with family and friends with holiday celebrations and we make resolutions on how to improve ourselves. We address loved ones and strangers alike with Happy New Year greetings – affirming our common aspirations for better days ahead. Whatever our differences, we all want life to be good.\nI will celebrate my 70th birthday on New Year’s Day. It’s not too unusual for someone to remark upon this accident of birth, yet I don’t recall ever being particularly impressed with it myself. However, I have been thinking about it more than usual as I enter those years that generally define actually being “old” instead of “getting old.”\nI certainly hold to the expectation of being around for a reasonable number of future springs, but I cannot deny that I am in the winter of my life. No matter, my hopes do not falter – they have simply changed course and reinvented themselves as happens to all who arrive in this living world.\nWriting this column for the past two years has been a gift. It has been a discipline – a way to gather my thoughts and consider the order of my life. I have been gratified by those who contacted me and expressed their appreciation of my bi-weekly meanderings. As I write this final column, it is clear that living a country life has been the right choice for me. Indeed, the natural world has showed me time and again that every season is a growing season and our winter celebrations are an affirmation of the eternal promise of life. Happy New Year!\nLaura Tonkyn has spent 40 years becoming as self-sufficient as possible with her jack-of-all-trades husband, Art, on their eight-acre homestead in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

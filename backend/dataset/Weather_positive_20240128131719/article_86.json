    "text": "CHENNAI: The city has set a rare rain record this year, having received above normal rainfall both in the southwest and northeast monsoon seasons for the fourth time in 40 years. Nungambakkam observatory, which covers the city's core localities, recorded 74cm during the July-September southwest monsoon and 127cm in the October-December northeast monsoon that has another three days to go. The average rainfall during the two rain seasons at the weather station is 44cm and 85cm. The observatory previously recorded excess rain during the two monsoon seasons in 2011, 1996 and 1983. This year, weather trackers said, the city and its suburbs received above normal rainfall during the two monsoons. While favourable conditions such as northwesterly winds pushing rain clouds over the city during the southwest monsoon left 74cm and 95cm in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam, cyclone Michaung drove the rain records during the northeast monsoon leaving 127cm and 120cm in the observatories.\\\"During the southwest monsoon, north Tamil Nadu including Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpet received large excess rainfall. The western ghats region, which normally gets good rainfall during the June-September season, received below normal rain. During the northeast monsoon, except for one or two occasions of heavy rainfall, it was the torrential rains brought by cyclone Michaung which pushed the rainfall records in Chennai,\\\" said N Senthamarai Kannan, director, regional weather forecasting centre. Blogger Pradeep John said records show Nungambakkam registered excess rain in the two seasons in 1976, 1966, 1847, 1826 and 1818. \\\"During El Nino years like 2023 and 1976, there were more break periods during the southwest monsoon over other parts of the country, when we received rainfall in the city. This year, we crossed 200mm in June, August and September and recorded 565mm in November and 595mm in December,\\\" he said. \\\"The next round of rainfall may be in January first or second week when there may be light spells,\\\" he added.",

Many camped out on sidewalks overnight, staking out their spots in the afternoon on New Year’s Eve.\nThe parade was briefly interrupted by about 50 pro-Palestinian protesters carrying a banner demanding a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. They blocked the route before peacefully dispersing under police orders, said city spokesperson Lisa Derderian.\nMcDonald was set to toss the coin before the 110th Rose Bowl college football game between Alabama and Michigan.",

    "text": "BY - Fri, 29 Dec 2023 - 03:00 GMT BY Fri, 29 Dec 2023 - 03:00 GMT CAIRO – 29 December 2023: It is sunny today! Many areas across Egypt, including Greater Cairo, have witnessed light to moderate rainfall over the past 48 hours. However, nice weather is expected to continue over the coming few days in most areas nationwide. Water pools have spread across the streets in Cairo until northern Upper Egypt on Thursday, causing traffic congestions amid efforts by state’s relevant authorities to remove rain water from roads. Despite the nice weather, the northern coast can experience light to moderate rain on Saturday and Sunday, according to the Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA). Therefore, residents of Alexandria and Matrouh should carefully prepare their outdoor plans this week. The EMA expects moderate weather during daytime in Greater Cairo, Nile Delta, the northern coast, and northern Upper Egypt, while warm weather continues in South Sinai and southern Upper Egypt. People across the nation should expect cold weather during nighttime. Average temperatures based on the EMA expectations next week: - Cairo and Lower Egypt – Highs: 21 – lows: 14 - Northern coasts – Highs: 21 – lows: 13 - South Sinai – Highs: 25 – lows: 16 - Northern Upper Egypt – Highs: 22 – lows: 9 - Southern Upper Egypt – Highs: 25 – lows: 12 Comments Leave a Comment",

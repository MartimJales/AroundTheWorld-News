    "text": "The rain did not succeed in dispersing the citizens from Independence Square who were determined to feel and repeat the New Year's Eve in Podgorica. Some visitors were happy to close their umbrellas and indulge in the music and the rain, while the restaurateurs from the cottages thought of those in need of shelter. Thus, they spread umbrellas, under which visitors gathered drinks and food. The first evening of the new year was marked by the performance of musician Tina Džankić, after which the Highway band performed, playing foreign, domestic and regional hits. After them, Bane Nedović performed, who started and ended the two-hour performance with the national anthem of Podgorica. \"The impressions are wonderful, we enjoyed ourselves on stage. Our city is the most beautiful in the world and we have to love it. When five, ten or 15 people come to the concert, a thousand people, it's irrelevant. The important thing is that they enjoy themselves as they did tonight,\" says Nedović for Media Bureau. The citizens point out that it was worth coming, and that it is important to support Montenegrin music creators. Even on the first evening of January, there were foreigners at Trg Nezavisnosti, who said that they were comfortable in Podgorica and that they were impressed by the music program. The capital has also prepared a full-day program for today. Apart from the Independence Square, the houses and the music stage are on the squares of Bećir-bey Osmanagić in the Old Town and St. Petar Cetinjski. Bonus video:",

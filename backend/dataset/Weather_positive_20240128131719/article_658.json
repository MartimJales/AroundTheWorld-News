    "text": "Written by Muhammad Ayman Tuesday, January 2, 2024 04:00 AM\nReceive the company’s\nweather app Apple A major design overhaul, thanks in part to a number of features brought over from the popular weather app Dark Sky, which Apple acquired in 2020, according to macrumors.com.\nThese features made the\nweather app’s interface more detailed and expanded existing sections to include things like Weather maps Precipitation, air pressure and more.\nApple has also redesigned the 10-day\nweather forecast to include more at-a-glance information, and if you’re wondering what the horizontal bars mean, they simply provide a view of the likely temperature range over the course of each day.\nThe longer the horizontal bar for any given day, the greater the temperature change over the 24-day period, and you can get a better idea of this when looking at today’s temperature at the top of a 10-day\nweather forecast. The white dot on the bar is where the temperature fits Current with expected range.\nWhat do the colors of the temperature range mean?\nDark blue: extremely cold (below 0°C)\nLight blue: cool (0°C to 15°C)\nGreen: slightly cool (15°C to 20°C)\nYellow: slightly warm (20°C to 25°C)\nOrange: warm (25°C to 30°C)\nRed: extremely hot (30°C and above)\nA legend for these color codes can also be found when opening the temperature index map for the location.\nIn Apple’s revamped\nWeather app, you can also sign up for next-hour precipitation notifications that will alert you when rain, snow, or hail falls in the next hour at your current location, or at another location you’ve added to the Weather app.",

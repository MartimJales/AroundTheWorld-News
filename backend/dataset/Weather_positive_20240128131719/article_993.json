    "text": "Driving experts have said you should always carry a potato in severe weather conditions.\nStorm Henk brought deadly flooding and fierce 94mph winds to parts of the UK this week, and travel chaos is expected to continue as the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain that runs until 3am on Friday and covers parts of the south and the east. Driving in these weather conditions can be dangerous and care should be taken to ensure you're safe on the roads - and now motoring experts have encouraged all drivers to keep a potato in their vehicle at all times.\nIt is always recommended to stay indoors and off the roads during severe weather conditions, but that isn't always viable and sometimes you have no choice but to get in your car. And to keep yourself safe, experts at John Clarke Motor Group have shared some handy hacks that can keep you protected.\nFirst on their list was ensuring every driver keeps a potato stashed in their car for emergencies. And no, it's not for eating! According to the experts, rubbing the cut side of a potato against the outer surface of your windscreen can make a difference when it comes to driving in extreme weather, as it will stop it from fogging up in the cold.\nThey said: \"Not only can it stop your windscreen from freezing in the winter, but it can also be a huge help when driving in the rain. The starch in the potato acts as a barrier between the glass and the air and can help with that all too common issue of your windscreen fogging up, making it hard to see.\"\nExperts also urged drivers to \"keep a safe distance\" from others on the road, meaning that during heavy rain, you should maintain double the normal distance between yourself and the car in front of you. This is because sudden downpours can \"panic drivers\" and cause them to slow down quickly.\nAn emergency kit was deemed a vital tool to have in your car at all times too, as it's important to have the right equipment on hand to keep you safe if your car should break down in the middle of a storm. Some things you should keep in your car in case of emergencies include:\nA power bank for your phone Warning triangle in case of breakdowns Non-perishable food Water Torches Thermal blanket or clothing High vis vest The experts recommend you avoid using cruise control in severe weather if your car has it, as you need to have full control of your vehicle at all times. They also said you should familiarise yourself with how sensitive or heavy your brakes are before driving anywhere so that you can have \"better reaction times\" while out on the road, and told all motorists to \"drive slow\" and avoid large puddles, as they could cause your tyres to \"lose traction\".\nDo you have a story to sell?

    "text": "A “settled weather” forecast spells good news for Northlanders who wish to go fishing, travelling and swimming this week.\nMetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said the temperatures throughout the week would average about 22C with a mix of cloud cover, sunshine and mild afternoon showers.\nTowards the weekend, an approaching “frontal system” would bring in bouts of rain on Saturday.\n“The good news is that the system will improve by Sunday, which is expected to be sunnier and more pleasant.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. “Upcoming weeks will also have a settled and comfortable weather averaging about 25C, which presents a good opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities these holidays,” Makgabutlane said.\nFor those going freshwater fishing, Northland Fish & Game regional manager Craig Deal felt the good weather forecast provided the perfect opportunity for licensed anglers to go trout fishing this season.\n“It’s an open season, so the regulations are quite relaxed. But having said that, people should catch no more than three trout per day, and they should measure no more than 30cm in size,” Deal said.\nFor people aiming to go saltwater fishing, fish such as marlin, tuna and mahi mahi were the common ones found during this “gaming season”, according to founder of Snap Fishing Ventures Nik Key.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. With over 40 years of experience in the sea, Key teaches and guides people who want to learn how to fish – using lures only.\nHe highly advises beginners to either go through a safety course or read the rules of being on the sea before taking to the water.\n“We encounter several people on the water who have no idea what they are doing and either end up putting their life or others at risk.”\nOnce prepared, he insists beginners check tide times, along with the moon and bite times – which is usually during early morning or at dusk.\nUsing fresh baits and kabura lures were some of the tips he offered for those wanting to improve their fishing aproach and catch rates.",

    "text": "Updated: 17 hours ago| Happy New Year! If you’re heading out to celebrate tonight, the weather will be quiet and chilly. Temperatures will be dropping into the low and mid 40s by the sunrise. There is a chance for some patchy, dense fog overnight and in the morning. We’ll be a little warmer on New Year’s Day with highs in the mid 60s. A quick moving front will bring a few hit or miss showers around midday, but it looks like any rain will be light. Most of us will not see any rain, but we do expect more cloud cover. That front will drop temps to near freezing waking up on Tuesday morning. We will stay cool Tuesday afternoon with highs in only the mid to upper 50s. Updated: 17 hours ago| Happy New Year’s Eve!

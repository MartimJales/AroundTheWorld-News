The festival brings thousands of people to Parkes and through the Central West, and is one of the [best and most unique events on the calendar. ](/whats-on/) From January 10 to January 14, the region will come alive to celebrate Elvis Presley and all things Rock 'n' Roll in what is [the festival's 31st year](/story/8038472/). There'll be hundreds of Elvis, Jailhouse Rock and Rock 'n' Roll themed events across five days. Here are the [details](/whats-on/): This year's theme is an Elvis classic: Get along to Parkes and be sure to wrap yourself in everything Elvis' musical drama, Jailhouse Rock. In the 1957 classic, The King of rock 'n' roll plays Vince Everett and is serving a one-year jail sentence for manslaughter. While in the big house, his cellmate, a former country singer, introduces him to the record business. As the movie goes, Everett takes to it so well that he decides to become a singer when he gets out. However, he is quickly disillusioned by the record business. Then, with the help of a new friend, he decides to form his own label, and soon becomes an overnight sensation. Jailhouse Rock is Elvis' third film that captures early Elvis in all his leg-quivering, nostril-flaring, lip-snarling teen idol glory.

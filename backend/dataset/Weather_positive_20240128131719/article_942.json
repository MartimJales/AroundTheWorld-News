That’s why finding the right footwear for winter weather is essential.\nYou can find plenty of winter boots, but if you want truly waterproof shoes, duck boots are the way to go, especially if you plan to be active outdoors this winter.\nIf you want to keep your feet dry and comfortable all winter, here are the best women’s duck boots for every price point.\nWhat are duck boots? If you’re not sure how duck boots differ from other winter boots, it helps to understand their origins. The shoes started as hunting boots designed to keep the feet warm and dry when active outdoors. They have a waterproof construction (hence them being called duck boots) with a rubber section across the toes and top of the foot and a leather upper to prevent rain and snow from getting inside and wetting your socks.\nMost duck boots hit at the ankle, but you can find some longer pairs that hit at mid-calf. Many pairs feature laces, but you can find some duck boots in a pull-on style. They all have a rubber sole that provides effective traction in slick conditions, though.\nWhile duck boots are traditionally used for rain, some pairs are lined with flannel or other materials to provide warmth, making them ideal for snow.

    "text": "The Audi Q5 has been one of the most popular compact luxury SUVs of the year, beating out longtime rivals from BMW and Mercedes-Benz . A few years ago, following Mercedes' lead it added a second coupe-like bodystyle to the lineup, which broadened the appeal to fans of a sportier look.\nThe German automaker's S models, as in S6 as opposed to A6, or SQ5 as opposed to Q5, is the equivalent of BMW's M line of sporty vehicles in that they come with bigger, more powerful engines, sportier suspension and styling.\nFor 2024 there are a few additions including standard Audi active lane assist, heated steering wheel with Hands on Detection (HoD), and remote start with the myAudi app (except for PHEV models). Premium Plus trims are offered with navigation including a trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus. Interior material packages have also changed with new Black Optic trim packages and Arkona White paint replaces Ibis White.\nThe Audi SQ5 Sportback comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder delivering 349 horsepower (hp) and 369 pound-feet (lb-ft) of torque. It has a fast-acting eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters that feel like they're actually shifting on command. In some vehicles the time between pressing the paddle and the shift feels like a full second. In the SQ5 it's fractional. At full tilt it can get to 60 miles per hour (mph) in 4.7 seconds.\n2023 Audi SQ5 Sportback driving on road. The 2023 Audi SQ5 Sportback has an automatic transmission with paddle shifters. Audi of America\n2023 Audi SQ5 Sportback rear view on road. The 2023 Audi SQ5 Sportback has driving modes for Sport and Off-Road. Audi of America The SQ5 sounds grumbly during a cold startup, but in a cool way. It this, the highest-performance version of the Q5 line, the six-cylinder engine is snappy off the line and in traffic. The eight-speed automatic is excellent in Sport mode where shifts rival that of a dual-clutch transmission. During high-speed travel the engine is mostly quiet, as is wind and road noise.\nThe SQ5 Sportback also comes standard-equipped with adaptive dampers and this one had the optional air suspension that allows for adjustment of the ride height in addition to the firmness of the suspension. Dynamic steering is also available and offers a variable steering ratio that adjusts based on vehicle speed. That means the already small SQ5 is even easier to park while still being stable at high speed.\nIt also has Allroad and Off-Road settings, perfect for taking dirt roads to an early Christmas dinner. It was smooth and controllable in the slop, only slamming over one chuckhole that was exceptionally deep. With Audi's refined all-wheel drive system, it's a breeze to power through turns even if the weather is bad.\nThe cabin of this SQ5 was covered in red leather with diamond stitching on the seats. Those seats are firm but surprisingly comfortable over a few hours' drive. They also have great adjustments for a low, cocooned driving position.\n2023 Audi SQ5 Sportback interior. The 2023 SQ5 comes with a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Audi of America\n2023 Audi SQ5 Sportback rear seats. The 2023 SQ5 has seating for five passengers. Audi of America The rest of the interior is typical Audi with a giant sunroof letting light in and brushed metal and carbon fiber trim. The knobs are excellent and clicky and easy to use while driving. It comes standard with a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . The screen is high on the dashboard so it doesn't look as clean as more integrated setups.\nThe 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster has viewing modes for classic, sport and dynamic. On SQ5 models an S Performance mode is added with a speedometer and tachometer. A Bang & Olufsen sound system with 705 watts is optional.\nThe technology all works well and the multitude of cameras are great for parking and moving through small spaces. They do need to be clean though. After a few hours on dirt roads they became next to useless.\nThe SQ5 and other Audi's also have vehicle-to-X (V2X) capability meaning they can talk to traffic lights, among other things. This means it can tell you how long until a red light, or how long until a green light when you're stopped. It also suggests taking your foot off the accelerator when an upcoming light is changing.\nThe SQ5 looks small from the outside but feels spacious inside, even with two booster seats in the second row. It's only down about one cubic foot of cargo space from the non-Sportback SQ5.\nRead more from Newsweek The new Chevrolet Blazer EV has abundant power and options New, top-notch Toyota Crown is definitely not a Lexus The Hyundai Ioniq 6 is a near-perfect all-electric commuter car The SQ5 Sportback comes with blind spot monitors, lane departure warning, emergency braking front and rear, parking sensors and rear cross traffic assist standard. Adaptive cruise control with Traffic Jam assist, which steers, accelerates and brakes automatically at speeds up to 40 mph is optional, as is the top-view camera.\nThe Audi SQ5 Sportback competes with the sportier versions of the BMW X3, Lexus NX and Mercedes-Benz GLC . The Mercedes is the only one with a coupe-shaped version, however. The AMG GLC 43 Coupe starts at $68,200 with 416 hp. The Audi has a base price of $60,400. The BMW X3 M40i with 382 hp is $61,900 and the mid-range Lexus NX350 has a 275-hp turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and starts at $43,965.\nThe Audi outsells the rest for a reason, it has the right combination of sportiness and comfort, all-wheel control and technology. The BMW has a sportier feel all around, but a harsher ride. The Mercedes AMG GLC is faster, and more luxurious, but also more expensive. Either of the German three are fine choices, the NX doesn't feel as put together as the bigger RX, which is an excellent choice in the midsize segment. But here in compact luxury land, stick to the Germans.\nUncommon Knowledge Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial Guidelines About the writer Jake Lingeman\nFOLLOW Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Jake Lingeman is the Managing Editor for the Autos team at Newsweek.

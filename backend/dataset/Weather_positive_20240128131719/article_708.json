    "text": "Monty Don has been flooded with support atfer his home appeared to be on the verge of being flooded amid the UK downturn in weather. [BBC](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/bbc) Gardeners World star Monty shared a bleak update with his fans and followers on January 2. Taking to Twitter, now known as X, TV star Monty informed fans of the blow and typed: \"Occasionally I happen to mention on GW - usually on a lovely summers day -how wet Longmeadow can be, especially in winter when we dont film. I rest my case.\" Twitter follower Mark Beresford replied: \"The last few day have been exceptional wet here too..We have a new lake and island in the park behind our house.\" Staples said: \"Advantages and disadvantages I'm sure... it would be interesting to quantify these... from a gardeners point of view, enriching the soil, micro plastic pollution etc etc ...\" [READ MORE Met Office speaks out over UK snow bomb set to start 'next Monday'](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/met-office-speaks-out-over-28375208) \"We are in Lincolnshire and our ground is pretty much feet of clay. We have horses and our fields are lakes. It is horrendous. 2 weeks into spring with no rain and the ground will be cracked\" another fan wrote back. Witter said: \"You’ve posted pictures of the part of your garden down by a gate next to a field before where you planted some water tolerant plants but not from outside the window. Looking pretty damp.\" Witter said: \"Hope you’re safe. Sending kind thoughts.\" Kerri said: \"Wow that’s pretty close to the building your in, get your waders at the ready\" Dammers said: \"No gardening for you for a while. I was trying to do some yesterday but my lawns is boggy and I’m it’s turning it to mud.\" Cathy said: \"Feels like it has been raining for months here. The only gap was Boxing Day when we managed a lovely walk and saw yellow berried holly.\" Siobhan said: \"Heavy clay? We could throw pots with our soil. Hubby gifted me your new book in my [Christmas](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/christmas) stocking and I’m looking forward to settling down with it and a nice cuppa to forget the rain.\"",

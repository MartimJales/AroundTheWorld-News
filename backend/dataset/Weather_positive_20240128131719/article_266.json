    "text": "[Greta Cross](/staff/6563683001/greta-cross/) Following a few days of frigid weather and light snowfall, the holiday weekend is looking to be a bit more cheery. Springfield National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Lindenberg said the weather will continue clearing out Friday evening, with sunny skies expected through Monday, Jan. 1. No precipitation is expected before the new year. More sun means higher temperatures. The high for Saturday is predicted to be in the upper 40s, close to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, Lindenberg said. Temperatures will drop slightly, into the lower 40s on Sunday and Monday. As for New Year's Eve, the low is expected to be around 21 degrees Fahrenheit with a north wind around 9 mph.

    "text": "CARTER COUNTY, Tenn. — Going out on the lake may seem like the last thing you'd want to do in 30-degree weather, but for area sailors, the Frostbite Race has become one of their favorite traditions. New Year's Day and sailing have pretty much become synonymous on Carter County's Watauga Lake. Dozens of people came together to race just for fun. “We're a bunch of sailors. It's just a way to start the year off with what we love to do the most, so here we are, as crazy as it is,” Adair Murdoch said. Some members of the Watauga Lake Sailing Club have participated in the Frostbite Race every year. Others joined the club just before the race. “People really like to just be part of nature,” club treasurer Dean Isham said. “Because it's all about the wind. As soon as you turn the motors off, then you just hear the wind and the boat going through the water, so it's unlike a power boat. It's a slower pace. It's more relaxed.” More than a dozen boats of every size are on the water. The shape, types of sails, weight and more all require different skills. Many years, the title 'Frostbite Race' is a bit of a misnomer, but in 2024, it was certainly not one of those days, with some spitting snow and quite a bit of wind. “The last couple of years though, it's been 60 degrees,” Isham said. “Around here, you just don't know. I've heard stories from old-timers, saying yeah, they've shoveled snow off their boat.” Organizers said bad weather is actually a good thing for them. Strong winds are key to a good race. “We have generations, we have two, three generations with us, just fun for everybody,” Murdoch said.",

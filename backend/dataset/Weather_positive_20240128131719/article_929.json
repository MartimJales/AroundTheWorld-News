From the looks of what’s coming, Utah could see relief for the next seven to 10 days, according to\nKSL Meteorologist Matt Johnson.\nJohnson said with a storm building and clouds rolling in and eroding the inversion, the air should continue to improve.\nDevin Oldroyd contributed to this story.\nRelated stories\nUtah’s air quality: haze rolling in but a potential storm on the way Great Salt Lake managers holding out hope following slow start to winter snowfall Here’s what Utah’s snowpack looks like at the start of 2024 Project conducted on fog could help to improve future fog forecasts\n ",

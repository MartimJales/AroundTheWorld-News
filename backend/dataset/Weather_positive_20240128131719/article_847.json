    "text": "YORK'S floods have been caught on camera by members of our Press Camera Club. Most striking is the shot of a lone cyclist crossing Millennium Bridge by Adrian Mosses. Other shots show the Ouse spilling out across the riverside, including a stunning image by Gill Bradley taken this morning. Simon Boyle captured the scene at St Peter's Field with York Minster in the background. While David King caught the classic shot of a flooded Kings Arms pub. And thanks to David Johnson for his image of a flooded Rowntree Park. WOULD you like to see your photographs in The Press and online?

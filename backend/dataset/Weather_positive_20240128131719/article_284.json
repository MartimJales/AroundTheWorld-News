    "text": "TEXAS, USA â€” East Texans are preparing to ring in the new year with fireworks across East Texas. Before you begin to pop fireworks, make sure you understand the responsibility that comes with fireworks. Texas Firework Laws According to [Texas Department of Insurance](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/fire/fmfireworksell.html), retail fireworks permit holders are promited to sell fireworks for New Year from December 20 to January 1. To purcase fireworks, you have to be 16-years-old or older. In several East Texas cities it is prohibited to use fireworks within city limits such as - Jacksonville - Longview - Marshal - Tyler - White Oak In the city of Tyler, if you're caught setting off fireworks within the city limits it's a Class C Misdemeanor, which is a fine up to $500. In several counties, fireworks are allowed outside city limits such as - Gregg - Harrison - Rusk - Upshur - Panola However, even in these areas, it is still illegal to: - Shoot fireworks from or toward a vehicle and boat - Shoot fireworks from a public road, public land, park or lake - Shoot fireworks within 600 feet of a church, hospital, child-care facility, primary or high school without written permission The Texas Department of Insurance gives tips on how to safely use fireworks: - Always buy fireworks from an established retail outlet. - Only ignite fireworks outdoors in cleared areas away from houses, buildings, dry leaves, and flammable materials - Keep water handy for fires and emergencies. - Never experiment or attempt to make homemade fireworks. - Light only one firework at a time. - Never re-ignite malfunctioning fireworks; soak them in water and throw away. - Never give fireworks to small children. - Store fireworks in a cool, dry place. - Never throw fireworks at another person. - Never carry fireworks in your pocket. - Never shoot fireworks in metal or glass containers. - Wear eye protection when shooting fireworks. - After shooting them, soak fireworks in water before putting them in the trash. In addition to firework safety, officials are reminding locals celebratory gunfire is illegal and could cause seriously bodily harm or death. \"Make sure you get eye protection. Hands are protected and that you're not in an area that's dry, water down the area where you're at and having a extinguishment source,\" said Paul Findley, Jacksonville Fire Chief. Another safe option Findley mentioned is going to watch a professional fireworks display instead.

    "text": "Several\ncelebrities have jetted out of the UK on post-Christmas getaways, with many opting to see in the New Year in sunny locations such as the Maldives and Thailand.\nAmong those escaping the UK's chilly temperatures is\nMolly-Mae Hague, who headed to the Maldives shortly after Christmas Day with her fianc√© Tommy Fury and their 11 month old daughter Bambi.\nThe family-of-three have been residing at the\nluxurious The Ritz Carlton Maldives, which boasts several overwater villas complete with infinity pools.\nDespite hoping to catch a winter tan, Molly, 24, has revealed that it has \"rained every day\" since she arrived in the Maldives.\nThe mum-of-one posted a mirror selfie on her Instagram Stories, which showed her modelling a white bikini top and matching linen trousers, along with an open shirt.\nShe told her fans: \"You know it's a good holiday when it's rained every single day torrentially...and you're still having the best time,\" with a heart emoji. Molly then posted a clip of the rain to show her fans, writing: \"The. Entire. Time,\" with a laughing emoji.\nDespite the weather conditions, Molly and professional boxer Tommy, 24, appear to be having a great time with their daughter, who will turn one in January 2024.\nMolly shared sweet photos of Bambi tucking into a slice of toast in their villa, alongside an adorable clip of doting dad Tommy playing with her as she shared her snack with him.\n\"When your cheeks are that big they rest on your piece of toast,\" Molly joked alongside a photo of Bambi eating. She then said her daughter is \"learning to share\" as she showed Bambi feeding Tommy some toast.\nThe ex-Love Islander also unveiled her favourite evening outfit to wear on holiday when heading out with her boyfriend and daughter for dinner. She shared a clip showing her modelling a black body con maxi dress from Kim Kardashian's brand SKIMS with a thin gold chain necklace and a Celine mini bag.\nMolly kept her blonde locks neatly slicked back in a bun and went barefoot in the video. She wrote: \"Go to holiday dinner fit,\" as she blew a kiss at her followers.\nFans were loving her simple look, with one writing: \"Literally perfection,\" while a second said: \"You look UNREAL omg\".\nA third commented: \"Obsessed with you!!!!!!!\" and a fourth added: \"SO STUNNING\".",

However, they left the rainy conditions of the UK only to be met with torrential rain on the gorgeous South Asian island.\nTaking to her\nREAD MORE:\nMolly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury put on united front as they share sweet snap with baby Bambi\nShe then shared a video from the hotel pool area to showcase the heavy rainfall. \"Every. Single. Day,\" Molly-Mae added and posted a laughing face emoji.\nMolly-Mae has been sharing glimpses into her\nluxurious holiday with her fiancé and baby. The couple, who met during Love Island 2019, jet off on the luxurious trip on Boxing Day. They originally planned the trip just for the two of them but made a last-minute decision to bring their 11-month-old daughter Bambi with them so they could share her first New Year's Eve together.\nIn a recent YouTube video, the reality star admitted the idea of leaving their daughter at home with relatives was 'breaking their hearts'. The model and influencer explained: \"To be completely honest and 100% real with you, originally it was meant to be just Tommy and me going for a romantic holiday and our present to each other for\nChristmas.\n\"As it got closer and the holiday came around, we were both saying we didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of spending New Year’s away from Bambi. That was breaking both of our hearts.\"\nThe duo shared many posts about their holiday, including their first-class flight as well as their lavish resort as they enjoyed the island with a water villa at\nThe Ritz-Carlton on Fari Islands which comes with a private sun deck, infinity swimming pool, and steps that take them directly into the Indian Ocean.\nThe suite didn't come cheap either, with an eye-watering €2,700 per night price tag. A swanky goody bag includes a bottle of Whispering Angel wine, a fan and a wash bag with the hotel's luxury logo. Molly-Mae also shared a few gorgeous outfit ideas for the lavish dinners.\nFollow Mirror Celebs on\n Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

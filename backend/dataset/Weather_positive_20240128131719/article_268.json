    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas â€” Happy New Year! A cold front moved through Central Texas to kick off 2024, but it didn't bring any rain to dampen your New Year's festivities. We are tracking patchy to dense fog along and east of I-35. We just want to make sure that everybody is especially safe on the roads if you'll be driving late tonight with visibilities possibly dropping under a quarter mile for some spots. We're also keeping an eye on the potential for patchy 'super fog' tonight. 'Super fog' is when smoke and fog mix to produce extremely low visibility values. Lingering smoke from fireworks displays has been known to produce 'super fog', so again please drive carefully. New Year's Day will be breezy and chilly. The morning will start in the 30s and 40s, and the afternoon will only reach the mid to upper 50s with a brisk north wind. This dry, breezy cold front will likely keep cedar levels sky high. So temperatures will stay chilly through most of the upcoming week, but we're also tracking a much wetter weather pattern. A widespread rain will move into Central Texas for Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday evening. There could be pockets of heavy rain and embedded storms, but we are not anticipating any issues with severe weather. This is just the first round of rain for the week, and it will likely bring a widespread quarter inch to one inch of beneficial rainfall. The second round of rain will move in on Friday. Models remain in strong agreement that another system will produce widespread showers and a few embedded storms, but we won't know the exact timing for another couple of days. As a result of both of these system, we're expecting most of the KVUE area to pick up 0.5 to 1.5 inches of beneficial rain over the next 7 days. This pattern is looking much more typical of an El Nino winter, and we hope it continues into the back half of January to improve our ongoing drought. The KVUE Weather Team will continue to monitor this developing forecast. In the meantime, the extended forecast can be found below:",

    "text": "Around this time of the year, much of the country is covered with rain and snow making riding very hard. If riders can get out, they are often limited in trail selection. There are very few places to ride Downhill bikes in the winter. Windrock Bike Park is one. Watch Jordan Bouldin take advantage of some stellar winter conditions below. In this video, Bouldin goes absolutely enormous on a side hit before showing his prowess in tight turns. The dirt he is riding is incredible and the cool and dry conditions look perfect for riding. Windrock is a special place. It is no secret that most of the best American Downhill Racers like Dak Norton, Neko Mulally, and Aaron Gwinn spend their winters there. The trails are incredibly technical but fast, the perfect place to open it up on a downhill bike. This fall, Aaron Gwinn purchased the bike park and has big plans for it. Read more about Aaron's plans below. For an avid Downhill racer like Jordan, Windrock is the perfect place to ride all year. Don't miss another headline from Bike Mag!

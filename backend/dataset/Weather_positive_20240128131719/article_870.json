    "text": "While it certainly isn't sunbathing weather at the moment, these Norfolk beaches are perfect for a winter walk. We asked our social media followers where their favourite beaches are for a stroll and these were the most popular responses. 1. Holkham The Holkham National Nature Reserve boasts a diverse range of habitats, but it is best known for its beach with unspoilt stretches of golden sand. The beach is also a popular site for ground-nesting birds and it has featured in films such as Shakespeare in Love and Annihilation.

Winterton In this seaside village, you will find a sandy beach and dunes, with the latter a designated national nature reserve. It is a popular spot for seal watching, so make sure to check the latest guidance if visiting there or nearby Horsey during the breeding season - typically from November to January. Make sure to pop into the Seal View Café next to the car park for refreshments, [which was recently visited by Hollywood actor Tom Hiddleston.](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23720549.tom-hiddleston-spotted-seal-view-cafe-winterton/) 3. Wells Start at The Quay, home to fabulous fish and chip shops, cafés and more, and then take a stroll up the long path towards Wells Beach, which runs alongside the harbour. Step out into a vast expanse of golden sand lined with immaculately kept colourful beach huts. 4. Gorleston The beach in Gorleston was [named the best in the UK by Tripadvisor in their Travellers' Choice Awards for 2023. ](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23351778.gorleston-on-sea-tripadvisors-top-25-beaches-europe/) It boasts golden sands and you can make a day of it after going for a walk by visiting the town's attractions, including arcades, restaurants and its charming theatre.

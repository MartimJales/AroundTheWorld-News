    "text": "It’s a common winter scene: tree branches, powerlines, and fences coated in ice and snow.\nThese picturesque displays are often the result of ice rime or hoarfrost, winter phenomena that occur in very specific conditions.\nCaptured by Michelle Young in Western Bay, NL, on March 9, 2010.\n“Rime ice forms on cold days and nights when the atmosphere is calm,” explains Kelly Sonnenburg, a meteorologist at The Weather Network. “Water droplets freeze on surfaces, creating needle-like structures that can sometimes grow in strange ways, depending on the wind direction.”\nRime ice captured in Fort Frances, Ont., on Dec. 29, 2023 (Anika Beaudry, The Weather Network)\n“Hoarfrost forms in a somewhat similar way but doesn’t require as much moisture. Water vapour molecules contact a sub-freezing surface and bypass the liquid stage, forming fluffy, light, solid ice crystals on the surface.”\n(Graphic displays how hoarfrost develops)\nWhile the accumulation of ice and snow can be beautiful, it can also lead to some damage as it weighs down branches and powerlines.\nMultiple days of fog and freezing fog on the central Prairies in early December 2018 resulted in more than 30,000 calls from Saskatchewan residents, reporting power outages.\nRime ice captured on Dec. 29, 2023, in Fort Frances, Ont. (Anika Beaudry/The Weather Network)\nCaptured by Jeff Wizniak in Saskatoon, Sask. on Dec. 31, 2014.\nCaptured by Carole-Anne Oikawa in Lethbridge, Alta., on Jan. 9, 2018.\nGo to theweathernetwork.com/upload to share your photos and videos with us.

    "text": "When the mercury drops and we're faced with freezing temperatures outside, the last thing any of us want is for our heating to fail.

And a considerate plumber has shared the advice which could sort many people's broken boilers this winter as the UK shivers its way into spring, report the [Derby Telegraph](https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/). Martin Broer has been telling customers they may not need a call-out if they try his money-saving advice.

Now, because there's such a small amount, it can get frozen up inside. \"What you do is boil your trusty kettle and just pour it all over the pipe. Once you've done that it should defrost. Go inside, reset your boiler, and everyone's happy!\" Mr Broer shared a video of the advice on his company's Facebook page and many of his customers thanked him for the trick.",

    "text": "Hobart Hurricanes opener Ben McDermott has lodged a ball in the roof at Marvel Stadium with a massive strike in the BBL clash against the Melbourne Renegades.\nMcDermott catapulted a loose delivery from Tom Rogers so high over mid-wicket that the ball became stuck among the rafters of the closed roof, rather than falling back to ground on Thursday night.\nThe umpire signalled a six for the lofty strike, although batters are no longer automatically awarded maximum runs for hitting the roof under changes to Cricket Australia's playing conditions this season.\nMcDermott's rocket shot had to be adjudged to be on its way over the boundary for the umpire to award six runs.\nThe Renegades had earlier overcome a slow start to compile a competitive 4-147 as Jordan Cox led the recovery.\nThe Renegades had crawled to only 56 runs from their opening 12 overs until Cox kickstarted their innings with a huge six in the power surge.\nThe hard-hitting England batter was the main aggressor in a critical 66-run stand with Jonathan Wells for the fourth wicket, until lofting a quicker ball from Riley Meredith (1-34) to Chris Jordan at mid-on.\nWells (38 not out) put his foot down from there to steer the under-fire Renegades to a total they will hope to defend against a side that tends to struggle on the road.\nThe Hurricanes had the hosts on the ropes from the opening over when Tim David dismissed Shaun Marsh caught behind for a duck to complete a wicket maiden.\nSouth Africa star Quinton de Kock (20) looked set to reignite the Gades' innings in his final BBL match this season, until giving up his wicket with a timid slice to deep point.\nRising star Jake Fraser-McGurk (26) was next to make a solid start, but after smacking a powerful boundary he was out next ball after picking out Jordan at long on.\nHobart left-arm spinner Patrick Dooley (0-16) was a key to restricting the Renegades' top order, delivering 15 dot balls in four tight overs.\nDavid was not called on to bowl a second over, despite claiming one scalp without giving up a run to start the match.\nThe Gades entered the clash without captain Nic Maddinson, with Will Sutherland instead taking the reins.\nFormer Australian one-ball skipper Aaron Finch was also left out of the XI.\nFinch revealed before the match that this season will be his last in the BBL, as the second-highest run-scorer in the history of the competition winds down his career.\nThe Hurricanes are four points behind the Sydney Sixers (third) and the Melbourne Stars (fourth), but had two matches in hand ahead of their clash with the Renegades, as they look to keep pace with the top four.\n ",

    "text": "Scotland residents were recently treated to a rare and enchanting natural light display featuring shimmering rainbow clouds gracing the sky. This phenomenon, identified as Nacreous or Mother of Pearl clouds, occurred near Nairn Beach on Christmas Eve, casting a vibrant spectacle shortly after sunrise around 9 am. A 29 year old photographer Joshua Earle captured this extraordinary event and shared a video on his Instagram account. Earle in the caption expressed his awe, stating, These incredible clouds have been appearing across the UK this week. This video was taken near Nairn Beach at around 9:00 am this morning. I still can't wrap my head around what I'm seeing! Nature is simply amazing. He explained that the phenomenon also known as Polar Stratospheric Clouds occurs due to high arctic clouds containing tiny ice crystals that refract sunlight. It's worth keeping an eye out at sunrise and sunset this weekend if you're in the UK. You might just spot a rainbow cloud! Earle added, encouraging others to witness this rare celestial spectacle. The photographer noted that the vibrant clouds adorned the horizon, creating shimmering rainbows within the clouds. Although it was his first encounter with these clouds, they had appeared three or four times in the week leading up to Christmas Eve.The Instagram video gained immense popularity, reaching over 3.8 million views and 272,000 likes. Users shared their fascination, offering scientific explanations and personal stories.",

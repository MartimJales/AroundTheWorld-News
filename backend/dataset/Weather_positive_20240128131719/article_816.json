    "text": "NORTHSTATE, Calif. — The Department of Water Resources (DWR) shared their first snowpack survey of 2024 on Tuesday. Last year's snowpack was one of the largest ever in California, with a [fifth survey](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/May-2023/May-2023-Snow-Survey) [last May reading as 254% above-average. But early in this new year, that number is much different.](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/May-2023/May-2023-Snow-Survey) Below is the [first comparison](https://krcrtv.com/news/local/gallery/california-department-of-water-releases-first-snowpack-survey-of-2024?photo=2) between last year and this year, courtesy of the DWR. Phillips is the main survey station, near Lake Tahoe. Those numbers are on the top, with state-wide numbers on the bottom. In both cases, the yearly difference is drastic. A big change this winter is the fact we're in an [ El Nino](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/december-2023-el-nino-update-adventure) year—the first since 2018/2019—which means, in simple terms, that the jet streams are switched and conditions are thrown out of whack. But El Ninos are not a perfect indicator of what’s to come during winter. The DWR says there has been extreme annual variances in recent winters. In terms of last winter, officials told KRCR it was truly an outlier. \"I would definitely classify last year as an extreme anomaly,\" said Michael Anderson, State Climatologist for the DWR. \"We really had some unusual events line up that created those windows where we had a lot of really extreme activity, and then we had these windows where absolutely nothing was happening. And this period of really wet, really dry, really wet.\" \"What we're seeing this year more [is] not quite the strength of either wet or dry, but everything kind of being a little bit subdued,\" Anderson continued. Anderson and Andrew Schwartz of the [UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/research-unit/central-sierra-snow-lab) each said it is too soon to know how the state's snow pack/water supply will look in 2024. In regards to [this week's storms](https://twitter.com/NWSSacramento/status/1742283967490048241?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), both men said the outlook likely won't change much, although many ski parks are expected to get a needed boost. The DWR will conduct several other snowpack surveys between now and the spring, with their peak data coming in April. One early positive is that experts believe our precipitation levels across California will ultimately finish above-average. -- To report errors or issues with this article please",

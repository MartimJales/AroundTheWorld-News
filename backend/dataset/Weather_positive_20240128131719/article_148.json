    "text": "A man has claimed a pint saved his life during the \"pure carnage\" of Storm Gerrit , which has left homes in the UK completely destroyed. Frightful scenes were seen of houses in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester of an \"absolute disaster\" which left property owners reeling from terrible damages. A \"localised tornado\" brought on by the storm is believed to have been the cause. Despite the strong gusts of wind and property damage, the tornado lasted just 15 seconds, with local Andy Turner describing the tragic damages as \"pure carnage\".

He has since spoken out on what he believed was a \" hurricane \" which has left his wife's car beyond repair while his own vehicle was bashed by a tree. Speaking to The Sun , Andy said: \"At 11.30pm last night, there was - all I can describe - is a hurricane came through. It lasted for about 15 seconds. Cars were parked outside the house. My wife's car is a write-off. My car took a bit of the brunt of the tree. \"It's just lucky that nobody was hurt. It was pure carnage.\" Fellow resident Euan Walsh, 21, has credited popping out for a pint as having saved his life after a last-minute change of plans. The Cherry Grove resident said: \"I was in Wetherspoons when it happened. The windows from the Bistro next to it came in. I just finished work and I was going to walk home when I decided to go to the pub - so a pint saved my life possibly.\" Dad Kevin Welsh, 57, added: \"I was watching the Woman in Black when I heard all this noise outside. I've lived here for 36 years and never experienced anything like this – we do get strong winds but only in one direction, this came from every direction and lasted all of one minute.\" Other residents were spooked, not by the Daniel Radcliffe-starring horror flick but by longer-term damage from the \"25 to 30 seconds storm\". Resident Matthew Marsland said the whole incident lasted just half a minute, but the impact was brutal. He said: \"I heard extreme noise at my back window. I was stood at my patio door and there was just basically a crazy sounding noise and then vibrations through the glass. I looked out of the window and saw a bit of debris so I thought I'd go out and pick a few bits up. \"Then I saw a piece of tree next to my neighbour's car, then I looked further along the street and saw a gutter in the middle of the street so I thought I'd go and pick that up, and then I saw my neighbour had had half his house torn off.\" Crushed cars, battered houses and in some instances whole rooftops blown off and away by the storm, were seen in gnarly pictures procured from the street. Lyndsey Moody, another resident on the street, believes her son's life was saved by his love of video games. She said: \"We were lucky that no one was killed. \"The chimney took out an internal wall and my son's bedroom. If he hadn't been on his computer chair with wheels it probably would have killed him. Half of the roof is hanging over the pavement so we are trying not make that safe.\" Insurance company ABI spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: \"Insurers expect and are ready for any type of bad weather, such as tornado-force winds. Anyone who has suffered damage should contact their insurer for advice.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking https://www.dailystar.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/.",

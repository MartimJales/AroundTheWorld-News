    "text": "Soy futures recover from June low as rains benefit Brazil crops January 03, 2024 at 05:24 pm Share CHICAGO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures edged higher on Wednesday, after favorable rains in dry areas of top-exporter Brazil sent the market to its lowest levels since June.\nCorn futures also rose slightly after setting a contract low in earlier trading, while wheat extended losses to a one-month low.\nRains should continue to benefit soybean and corn crops in northern Brazil this week, analysts said, after hot, dry weather has prompted analysts to slash their production estimates.\n\"The better weather in South America and the lack of any new export sales announcements make it difficult to be a buyer in the short run,\" said Tomm Pfitzenmaier, analyst for Summit Commodity Brokerage in Iowa.\nCBOT March soybean futures were up 4-1/2 cents at $12.78 a bushel by 11:10 a.m. CST (1710 GMT) after the contract fell earlier to its lowest price since June 28 at $12.65-3/4.\nThe market saw some short-term buying after its sell-off, brokers said.\nHigher supplies from other South American producers are likely to offset crop losses in Brazil, said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for StoneX.\n\"Buyers have not yet seen the need to increase imports of U.S. soybeans to compensate for a 'short' Brazil crop,\" Suderman said.\n\"Part of the reason for that has been expectations for the Argentine crop to nearly double this year to close to 50 million metric tons, while increased production is also expected in Paraguay and Uruguay.\"\nStrength in the U.S. dollar also hung over agricultural markets, analysts said. The dollar rose to a two-week high, underpinned by elevated U.S. Treasury yields.\nCBOT March wheat dropped 6-1/4 cents to $6.00-1/2 a bushel and hit its lowest price since Dec. 1. March corn was up 1-1/4 cents at $4.65 a bushel after setting a contract low of $4.61-3/4.\nSpeculators have entered 2024 with some of their most bearish-ever views towards CBOT corn, but in past years, that positioning has rarely proven sustainable.

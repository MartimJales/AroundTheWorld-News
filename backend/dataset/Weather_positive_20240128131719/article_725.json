    "text": "Good Tuesday morning and Happy New Year! Today, we’ve got morning lake-effect clouds and temperatures in the 20s so a huge difference compared to last week! This afternoon, lake-effect clouds shift north and highs reach the low to mid 30s so we could get some peeks of sun if we’re lucky before sunset. Highest chance of that happening will be in the Southern Valleys farthest from the lake-effect cloud band.\nSpeaking of lake-effect, lake-effect snow showers begin to set up over the next day or so, but this event looks to mostly impact Tug Hill regarding accumulations. In the lowest elevations, barely any snow accumulation is expected as wind direction shifts south from a cold front pushing scattered snow showers into most of CNY early Thursday morning.\nRegarding the noise of a snowstorm next weekend, again with it being just over 5 days out, long range model guidance is only able to fine tune the track of the system which has since shifted a little south in the latest data. We will keep you informed of this as it develops.",

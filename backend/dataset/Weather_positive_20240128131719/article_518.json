    "text": "The beginning of 2024, the “first sunrise” heralding the new year (\nWeather Forecaster, Chief Weather Officer, January 1, 2024) – Japan Weather Association tenki.jp\nThe beginning of 2024: the first sunrise of the new year\nJanuary 1, 2024 07:18\nIt is the start of 2024. On January 1st (New Year’s Day), a beautiful “first sunrise” could be seen from Ikebukuro Sunshine 60 in Toshima Ward, Tokyo. I sincerely hope that this year will be a wonderful year for all of you.\n“First sunrise” of 2024 Mt. Fuji will also be dyed red\n2024 has started. The morning of January 1st (New Year’s Day) has a winter-like atmospheric pressure pattern, so it is sunny in many places, especially on the Pacific side.\nFrom the 54th floor of Ikebukuro Sunshine 60 in Toshima Ward, Tokyo, we could see the beautiful “first sunrise” at around 6:55. The first sunrise in central Tokyo was 6:51 a.m., but because there were many clouds over the sea to the east of Kanto, the sun appeared a little later than sunrise. We could also clearly see the snow-covered Mt. Fuji illuminated by the morning sun.\nNew Year’s Day The wind is cold in the morning\nThe\nweather today (New Year’s Day) is likely to be snowy and rainy in many places along the Sea of Japan. It will be sunny in most places on the Pacific side, but it will be windy and quite cold in the morning. Please be sure to protect yourself from the cold when going out during New Year’s holidays such as New Year’s visit.\nAs the strong winds subside in the afternoon, the cold will ease from the Kanto region to the west. The snow and rain on the Sea of Japan side is likely to stop in the afternoon in many places.\nLatest articles (weather forecaster)\nRelated Links\n2023-12-31 22:18:06\n#beginning #sunrise #heralding #year #\nWeather #forecaster #Chief # weather #forecaster #January #tenki.jp",

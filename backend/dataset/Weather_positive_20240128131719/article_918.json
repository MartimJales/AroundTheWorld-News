By the [start of January 2023](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-snowpack-well-above-normal-early-more-needed-for-good-water-year), the state's snow levels were already [off to a good start](https://kutv.com/news/local/active-start-to-weather-season-helps-utah-build-strong-snowpack-holiday-weekend-ski-utah-active-storm-track); one year later, and Utah is [not nearly as white](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-low-snowpack-raises-concerns-despite-reservoirs-remaining-mostly-full-winter-snow-weber-basin-water-conservancy-district). Many Utahns remember the [massive piles of snow ](https://kutv.com/news/local/cache-county-residents-digging-out-piles-of-snow-after-weekend-storm-wellsville-winter-weather-plow)that covered cars, signs and mailboxes throughout communities.

By Jan. 12, 2023, statewide snowpack was at [189% of normal](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-snowpack-snow-survey-usda-governor-spencer-cox-water-conservation-great-salt-lake-rain) for that time of year.

Despite the crowds that flocked to resorts, avalanches in the canyons were also a major concern for officials.

This winter has been a different story thus far, with low statewide snowpack levels as of Jan. 3. Despite this, experts said reservoirs [remain mostly full ](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-low-snowpack-raises-concerns-despite-reservoirs-remaining-mostly-full-winter-snow-weber-basin-water-conservancy-district)because of snowpack from 2022-2023.",

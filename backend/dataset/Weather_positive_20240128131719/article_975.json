    "text": "MIAMI - A comfortably cool start to Thursday with temperatures mostly in the low to mid-60s across Broward and Miami-Dade , a few inland areas saw the upper 50s. It was milder in the Keys with the low 70s. Some areas were five to 10 degrees warmer than Wednesday.\nAfternoon highs will be warmer with the upper 70s. A few showers will be possible due to a weak front moving through. This front will not have a lot of moisture so the rain chance is low.\nFriday we'll enjoy a cooler start with low 60s and highs will be seasonable in the upper 70s with mainly dry conditions.\nThis weekend will be warmer with lows near 70 degrees and highs around 80 degrees. Saturday will turn windy with the potential for scattered showers and storms. We remain unsettled on Sunday with the chance for some showers and storms. Early next week the rain chance decreases but we stay warm with spotty showers possible.\nMore from CBS News After chilly start, warming trend begins Wednesday afternoon Chilly start to 2024, plenty of sun in the afternoon After chilly start, a gorgeous afternoon with highs in the low 70s Sunrise police officer, attempted murder suspect injured in Fort Lauderdale shooting Family of beaten, mentally ill Broward Jail inmate seeks answers after deadly jail attack In: Fort Lauderdale Miami Lissette Gonzalez Lissette Gonzalez has served as the morning and noon meteorologist for CBS4 News since 2007.

    "text": "Power now restored to all homes in Scotland affected by Storm Gerrit All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through ‚Äúparticularly challenging conditions‚Äù to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution‚Äôs operations director, said the storm had brought ‚Äúserious disruption‚Äù with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland. We have restored power to all 48,000 customers who lost supply due to the impacts of [#StormGerrit] We thank customers for their patience and understanding while our teams worked to restore supplies in challenging conditions.

Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.",

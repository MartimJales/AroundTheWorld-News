    "text": "Cold weather greetings and Happy New Year from all of us at WCCB-TV Chilly days and cold nights ahead Hello 2024 and cold temperatures A great way to start the New Year with chilly weather Comfortable and near normal conditions for the next few days Our next chance of rain will not be until mid week. It will likely be Wednesday overnight as the next weather system comes through and grabs up some moisture from the Gulf Of Mexico. Look for quiet weather to prevail until Wednesday. Our overnight temperatures will remain on the cold side as we slide down to the upper 20s almost all week long with daytime highs in the lower 50s. This is right on track for early January as 52 is the average high right now. Snow lovers hang in there. We still have a long way to go this season. Some long range models suggest that we could possibly see some snow later this month or into February. Tonight: Becoming Mostly Cloudy and cold 35. New Years Day: Decreasing Clouds and seasonable High: 50 Tuesday: Sunny High: 51",

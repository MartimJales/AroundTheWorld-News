    "text": "The past 24 hours have been a flurry up here in Tahoe... literally! Resorts across the area delighted skiers with significant snowfall totals. Starting off strong, Palisades Tahoe reported 7-9 inches overnight, which is a much-needed dump after a dry couple of weeks! Nearby, Northstar Resort reported 5 inches over the last 24 hours. Further South, Heavenly received 3 inches over the last day, and Kirkwood got 11 inches ! Sugar Bowl also saw 11 inches overnight, and Homewood saw 4 inches at its base, with 6 at the summit. To say this is exciting is an understatement. Call it the end of Shark Week, because trails have been bony. Siberia Express recently opened at Palisades, and it was some of the funnest terrain open right now (without hiking) until you hit a rock, which, unfortunately, is almost completely unavoidable on the ungroomed stuff! Still fun, but man, is it putting your skis (and finesse) to the test! Shout out to the Big Mountain groms sending the cliffs to looker's right of Siberia. That is gnarly, and all of us chair-riders salute you for the stoke! Tahoe Daily Snow announced that this was all according to plan, as \"the storm performed almost exactly as expected Wednesday night, with 24-hour reports from the ski areas of 3-10 inches around the lake and 10-15 inches to the south!\" Mount Rose also saw 6-7 inches of reported fresh pow. Basically, no one's suffering out here. We don't want to beat a dead horse here, but always remember to put those chains on (if you don't already have 4WD). No one got to the mountain first getting in an accident on the way there! See you out there! Don't miss another headline from POWDER!

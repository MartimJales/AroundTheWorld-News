The teams will meet again at Marvel Stadium on January 13.\nMaxwell, the first player to reach 100 games for the Stars, won the toss and everything flowed for him from there.\nHe managed the Stars bowlers superbly, claimed 1-8 from his three overs and took two catches.\nMaxwell then combined with opening batsman Tom Rogers, who top-scored with 42no, to close out the match with a typically entertaining knock.\nHe scored 32 from 15 deliveries, including three successive sixes off Australian white-ball teammate Adam Zampa.\nRogers, who posted his best BBL score this season, said it was fun watching Maxwell’s innings from the other end.\n“I will never get used to being at the other end to Glenn Maxwell,” Rogers said.\n“That’s pretty ridiculous. The things he can do, I can’t do them and a lot of people can’t do them.\n“He’s box-office, that guy. A great captain and a great man.”\nThe start of the Stars innings featured Renegades paceman Tom Rogers bowling to opening batsman Tom Rogers.\n“He’s an absolute beauty, Tommy Rogers – he’s got me out a few times now, so I was a bit nervous for those first couple,” the Stars’ Tom Rogers said.\nThe Renegades could not score a boundary from the fifth to the 11th overs.\nAdding to the Renegades’ woes, FoxSports reported batter Joe Clarke is out for the rest of the tournament with the quad injury he suffered in Friday’s win over the Sixers.\nThey also had to leave out in-form spin bowler Mujeeb Ur Rahman because of a contract dispute with the Afghan cricket board.\nStand-in captain Will Sutherland strongly doubts Mujeeb will play for the Renegades again this season.\nIn-form Renegades No.3 Jake Fraser-McGurk only made 14 from 19 balls before he skied a catch to Maxwell off Beau Webster’s bowling.\nThey started brightly enough, scoring 33 from their first 2.5 overs, but once Jordan Cox was dismissed for nine they lost momentum quickly.\nFellow opener Quinton de Kock top-scored with 23 from 16 balls before Maxwell dismissed him.\nSpinner Dan Lawrence claimed 2-8 from his two overs.\nCox was brought in for his first BBL game of the season and Kane Richardson returned, while the Stars dropped Corey Rocchiccioli for Jono Merlo.\nOut-of-form Renegades captain Nic Maddinson remains sidelined.\nThe late-afternoon rain, which delayed the game by more than an hour, prompted a cheeky post on X from the Marvel Stadium-based Renegades. “Bit wet, but likely to clear. This wouldn’t have happened if there was a roof, btw,” they posted.\n© AAP",

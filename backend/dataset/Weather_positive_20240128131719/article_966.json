    "text": "The famous French resort of Les Deux Alpes\nA young Irish woman had a ‘miracle escape’ after leaving a nightclub in the French Alps in shorts and a T-shirt and getting lost in sub-zero temperatures.\nThe 19-year-old, who has not been named, had been on a ski holiday in Les Deux Alps resort.\n‘She left a club at around 4am on Wednesday morning,’ said a local police spokesman. ‘She was only wearing shorts and a T-shirt and had no idea where she was going.’\nExperiencing temperatures of -1C, the woman wandered through the Combe de Venosc mountain forest before managing to dial 112 – the number for the emergency services in France.\nBut she could not remember personal details, including her own phone number, which was blocked from showing. An operator finally managed to establish her father’s number back in Ireland, however, and he was alerted.\nThis finally led to the police sending the woman a message containing the Genloc geolocation app, which allows the authorities to locate lost people the moment they make a call.\nAfter GPS beacons picked the woman’s position up, patrols were despatched, and she was found ‘suffering from hypothermia,’ in the woods, at around 7am – three hours after leaving the nightclub.\nCommander Ludovic Saint Bonnet, of the CRS (Republican Security Companies) police unit in the Alps, said: ‘When we recovered her, she was suffering from some bruises, because she must have fallen while trying to find her way back and she was suffering from slight hypothermia.\n‘We can say that she is a miracle, because alone, so little dressed, she would not have been able to resist the cold for long.\n‘It was a real relief when the teams found her,’ said Commander Saint Bonnet, saying people had died in the past after ‘while wandering in this part of the mountains.’\nCommander Saint Bonnet called for better regulation, saying: ‘Just because we go out to nightclubs shouldn’t mean that we should forget to dress in accordance with the environment what surrounds us.’\nThe young woman was transported by helicopter to the Emergency Department of Grenoble University Hospital, where she continued to recover on Thursday. She was expected to make a full recovery, before returning home to Ireland.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

    "text": "Visitors and locals spend the first day of the new year at the beach The weather was perfect and the sea was calm. Many were grateful to enjoy the first day of 2024 on the beach. The weather was perfect and the sea was calm. Many were grateful to enjoy the first day of 2024 on the beach. The weather was perfect and the sea was calm. Many were grateful to enjoy the first day of 2024 on the beach. As the New Year begins, many people have resolutions, but a \"Monday reset\" at the beach was at the top of many people's lists. Charlie Mucciolo went out to Flagler Beach with his family. \"There's not many waves,\" said Mucciolo. \"...we're just going to paddle out on New Year's Day just to start the year off properly.\" It's a new year with new goals for Mucciolo. He's eating right and keeping himself healthy, so he can have even more days like today at the beach. \"We can keep paddling into and to our eighties and nineties. that's the whole point,\" he added Down in Daytona Beach, locals like Sharon Dacey also took advantage of the new day and new year to take a walk and reflect on all the good the last year brought. \"I'm very grateful,\" said Dacey. \"I should have more of a plan for my life, but I'm retired. I'm like 66, and just to be able to walk the beaches, is an accomplishment for me.\" Others like Scott Dally came in from quite far away. \"Newmarket, Ontario, Canada,\" he said. He's enjoying the beach but is mostly grateful for the nice weather. \"This is the warmest day,\" said Dally. \"We even had to scrape our car off a couple of days ago... it's first day of sun, actually. So it's been good.\" While they all have their reasons for being here, one thing they can all agree, spending New Year's Day on the beach was restorative.",

By the end of the quarter, F-series truck sales totaled 573,370, surpassing General Motors Co ‘s Silverado by a substantial margin of 169,949 trucks.\nThis positive trend in F-series sales is pivotal, marking the first instance of year-on-year growth since 2018. F-series sales have been dropping rapidly over the last few years.\nHowever, this success comes amid challenges, including a historic six-week labor union strike that impacted all of Detroit’s “Big Three” automakers. Ford, despite reaching an agreement, incurred significant costs.\nFurthermore, Ford’s decision to slash production of the F-150 Lightning, despite record sales in November, underscores the challenges in navigating changing market demands.\nAdditionally, reports indicate that about 400 Ford dealers, who initially joined the EV program announced last year, are now opting out due to stringent investment criteria and other membership conditions.\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\nRead More: ‘Wrong Frame Of Reference:' Elon Musk Rebuts Tesla Bear For Saying EV Stock Is ‘Egregiously Overvalued' Through Toyota Lens\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

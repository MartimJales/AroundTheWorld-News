    "text": "(Gray News) - 2023 ended with an incredible light show from space.\nNASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory captured a spectacular image of a strong solar flare erupting from the sun Sunday afternoon.\nThe close-up image of the sun shows a mix of yellow, orange, brown and black colors.\nA bright white flash that appears on the left side of the photo is the solar flare, which peaked at 4:55 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday.\nNASA said the flare is classified as an X5.0 flare, with X-class being flares of the highest intensity.\nSolar flares are powerful bursts of energy made of extremely hot solar material.\nFlares and solar eruptions, while beautiful, can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals and even pose a risk to spacecraft and astronauts.\nThe space agency said it constantly monitors the sun and space, studying solar activity, the solar atmosphere, particles and the Earth’s magnetic field.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc.

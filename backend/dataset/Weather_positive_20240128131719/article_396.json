    "text": "Colorado Springs is forecast for a sunny and bright Saturday, according to Meteorologist Alan Rose with Gazette news partner KOAA.\n\"A ridge of high pressure will deliver an exceptionally nice day of weather to Southern Colorado on this final Saturday of 2023,\" Rose said.\nThe high is expected to be in the low 50s with temperature dropping to around 23 in the evening, according to the National Weather Service in Pueblo.\nClouds will increase in the evening, making for mostly cloudy skies. This is expected to continue into Sunday, according to Rose.\nLooking ahead\n\"The first in a series of disturbances will roll into the state on Sunday,\" Rose said. \"This storm won't do much precipitation wise, with only a few light snow showers in the mountains. In the Pikes Peak Region, Sunday will be cooler and cloudier, with our daytime high only warming into the lower 40s.\"\nMonday is expected to warm up to the upper 40s and have more sunshine, Rose said.\nTuesday will likely bring colder weather and a light dusting of snow in the mountains and possibly Teller County.\n\"Looking at the big picture, no significant storms appear to be on the horizon over the next five to seven days,\" Rose said.",

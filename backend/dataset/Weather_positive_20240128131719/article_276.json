    "text": "A mega swell continued to batter California with big waves on Friday, Dec. 29, drawing surfers and spectators to the coastline to soak in nature’s spectacle.\nThe swell had dropped slightly\n following the previous day of massive waves that made headlines across the state. While the Southern California region fared better than the northern and central coast, which saw waves upward 25 feet, there was plenty of water moving around Friday creating hazardous conditions at local beaches.\nAnd it’s not over, with an even bigger swell expected to fill in on Saturday, which could mean waves close to 20 feet in some areas. Combined with a morning high tide, flooding in low-lying areas could cause trouble for streets, structures and parking lots that line the coast.\nBecause of the potential of larger waves, officials plan to close Bolsa Chica State Beach on Saturday until noon, following the lead of other State Parks shorelines, including Ventura and San Lois Obispo, said State Parks Superintendent Kevin Pearsall.\nWaves and the high tide were so strong Friday morning, beachgoers scrambled to get out of the ocean’s path as the water reached up to the bike path. Waves on Saturday are expected to be double the size, said Pearsall.\nWorkers stayed busy Friday reinforcing a 7-foot sand berm to keep the ocean from damaging the beach’s parking lots and reaching into Pacific Coast Highway.\nLast January a winter swell damaged the pathway and parking lots and they remained closed for months for repairs.\nIn the South Bay, the water reached the beach pathway at Torrance Beach. Beach erosion has caused escarpments along a number of beaches and the tide was running up to restrooms on narrower stretches like Redondo Beach, said Carol Baker, deputy director for Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors.\nAt one point along Will Rogers State Beach, erosion had made the sand impassible for maintenance vehicles, she said.\nThe big swell also delayed the start of a 5-month-long, $7.18 million sand dredging project in Marina del Rey’s harbor until Monday, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors.\nLos Angeles Fire Department Lifeguard spokesperson Pono Barnes said waves were 8 to 12 feet in the South Bay on Friday, but are expected to be 15 to 18 feet on Saturday in areas like Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach.\nA boat near Dockweiler beach washed ashore and was broken into pieces, Barnes said.\n“One of the reasons we are closing is because of safety reasons,” Pearsall said of the morning closure at Bolsa Chica, quipping that it’s a good time to go to the mountains. “It’s going to be a large one and safety is the first concern and people need to make that their priority when they want to come watch Mother Nature.”\nSome had to learn the hard way.\nMatt Wiehl was standing on a picnic table when a big wave crashed on him, giving him a salt-water shower. He threw his fists in the air with glee, happy he wasn’t knocked down by the force.\n“I wasn’t expecting that,” he said. “I thought I was at a safe distance, but I still got some rain showers from the ocean. I just love to see the power of the waves.”\nSurfer Eric McCreery was taking a break after a brutal paddle, he said. “This is great, you wait all year for days like this.”\nNovice should stay clear of the ocean, lifeguards warn, saying conditions are for expert wave riders only.\nA kayaker off Huntington Beach found himself in trouble late Thursday as the swell filled in near Dog Beach, his vessel tipping over, said Marine Safety Battalion Chief Trevor McDonald.\nThough the man needed lifeguard rescue, he was unharmed, McDonald said.\nHuntington Beach also suffered from severe erosion, especially on the north side of the pier, and lifeguard towers had to be pulled away from the ocean’s threat.\nIn Long Beach, a small waves sneaked in past the breakwater, a rare sight for the region that only sees surf when the swell direction is just right.\nJanet Robertson, a 35-year Torrance resident who walks the lower bike path regularly, got a wet reminder of the “don’t turn your back on the ocean” rule.\nSpotting some sea glass on what was left of the sand near a volleyball net, the water sneaked up behind her and she got wet up to her calves.\n“I turned my back to it and I was just shocked that it came that hard, ” she said. “It could have knocked me down. I’m just glad I got away from it.”\nA woman next to her had to jump onto the nearby hillside to escape getting wet.\nLifeguards are recommending people stay out of the water because the large surf and rip currents can be life threatening.\nAlso, stay off of all coastal jetties, piers, rocky shoreline and other waterside infrastructure.\nA High Surf Warning by the National Weather Service is expected to be in place until 10 p.m. Saturday.",

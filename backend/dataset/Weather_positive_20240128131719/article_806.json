    "text": "SEATTLE — On a rainy day, the only rain on top of mind is Purple Reign coming back to the University of Washington campus Tuesday afternoon. The [University of Washington football team](/huskies) arrived at Husky Stadium around 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after a thrilling Sugar Bowl win. Star Husky quarterback Michael Penix Jr. was seen getting off the bus with some new hardware -- the MVP trophy from the game. It's been a wild ride for him and this team heading to the national championship in less than a week. With a couple of fans showing their appreciation, congratulating, and welcoming the Dawgs on their historic season when they arrived back home. \"It was crazy I got to dap up some of the football players, walk by and congratulate them,” said Cedric Wykoff. “I saw Rome Odunze, that was probably the best moment for me, since I started working here he's just been a big name around here. It was great to meet here because I have a big poster on the front door.\" Meanwhile, Husky fans at the nearby University Book Store are still chomping at the bit, ready to bow down and talk about Monday night’s dawg fight. “I was sweating,” said Autumn Rainwater. “I kind of put deodorant on before it started, but we were on the edge of our seat the whole time. It was a tough game to watch. But it was a fun game to watch. It was very engaging.” She was just one of hundreds of shoppers packing the store Tuesday afternoon. Eager to buy anything purple and gold to represent this school championship bound. “We're shopping for some gear for the boys,” said Nassim Chrisman, “They go to preschool here at UW and they were really excited for the win, and they needed some more purple-colored clothes.” Officials with the University Book Store said tens of thousands of Husky merchandise were sold last month, setting a new record. It was the most since Washington was heading to the 2019 Rose Bowl.",

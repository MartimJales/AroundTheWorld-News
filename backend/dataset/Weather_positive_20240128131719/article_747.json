    "text": "Wilmington, NC based\nBryter Restoration of Wilmington is reaching out to local homeowners to share some tips that can help them prepare for the winter months. The locally owned business is dedicated to providing the community high quality services. This includes 24-hour availability for quality water damage restoration services in Wilmington and all surrounding areas of New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender Counties.\nBryter Restoration says, “Winter and the holiday season that comes along with it can be very beautiful, but like everything else in life, there are things you are going to have to look out for during winter months. For homeowners, a key concern is going to be preventing unexpected damage to their home from a burst water pipe or a leaky roof. Should something go wrong during the holiday season, it's going to put a damper on the mood and ruin what should otherwise be a fun time. The good thing is that there are preventative measures any homeowner can take.”\nBefore considering any specific actions, the company says maintaining an adequate temperature inside the home can go a long way in preventing unnecessary damage. Bryter Restoration recommends keeping the temperature in the house above freezing, especially in areas where pipes are located. This can be done by maintaining a constant indoor temperature or using additional heating devices (like space heaters).\nIn fact, burst pipes are one of the biggest risks homes face during the winter season. As the temperature drops, the risk of burst water pipes increases. When water freezes, it expands, putting pressure on pipes and potentially causing them to burst. A burst water pipe can lead to flooding, water damage and a completely unnecessary headache.\nHomeowners looking to prevent this should take care to insulate critical areas, as this provides protection against the freezing and expansion of water within the pipes. Bryter Restoration of Wilmington shares that homeowners should pay extra attention to colder rooms and areas such as the attic, basement and so on. They should do the same for certain outdoor spaces, such as garages.\nThe company recommends the use of polyethylene pipe lagging material, a flexible foam specifically designed for water pipe insulation. This insulation should be slid onto the pipes, covering them completely, with no gaps left at bends, fittings or valves.\nThe company also shares that homeowners should disconnect and drain outdoor hoses — and shut off the water supply to outdoor taps. This prevents water from freezing and expanding within the pipes, reducing the risk of bursts. However, even with careful preparation, the worst can still happen. Should there be an unpreventable burst water pipe, homeowners should immediately turn off the water supply at the main stopcock, shut off the central heating and then open taps to drain the system.\nHomeowners will also want to possibly get their roofs inspected, which can be a critically important step when preparing a house for winter. Winter storms, including heavy rain and especially hail, can end up wreaking havoc on a roof, so it is important that they take the initiative to repair any damage before their roof is exposed to the worst of winter weather. Homeowners who cannot access their roof can and should have it inspected by a contractor. Contractors will also be able to take care of any minor repairs that are needed. While this might be an unexpected expense, it will be far more affordable than dealing with any damages caused by a leaky roof over the winter.\nBryter Restoration was formed after many years of\nwater damage restoration work in the Carolinas. The members of the team have undertaken numerous projects following storms and hurricanes over the last 15 years, and they boast decades of combined experience serving the families of Wilmington and the Carolinas. In addition to providing their services to the city of Wilmington, Bryter Restoration of Wilmington’s service areas also include the surrounding cities, such as Wrightsville Beach, Myrtle Beach, Moorehead City, Carolina Beach and more.\nAnyone looking for water damage cleanup services in Wilmington or who simply wants to learn more about the services provided by Bryter Restoration of Wilmington should visit the company’s website to get started. The company encourages interested parties to directly get in touch via email or phone.

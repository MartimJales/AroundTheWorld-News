    "text": "By Jocelyn Garcia December 29, 2023 — 9.16am articles for later Add articles Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement As the year comes to an end, people are shifting their focus from Christmas lights to finding the best spot to view the New Year’s Eve fireworks to welcome 2024 with a bang.\nTwo firework shows, at 8.30pm and again at midnight, will light the sky over the Brisbane River on Sunday. Some 80,000 fireworks will make for one of the biggest displays in the city’s history.\nThousands of people are expected to converge on South Bank to watch the New Year’s Eve fireworks. Credit: Glenn Hunt\nDespite storms and a heatwave heralding the end of 2023, with rain forecast for New Year’s Eve in Brisbane, thousands of people are expected to make their way to South Bank, inner-city reaches and high spots for the fireworks.\nThe best viewing locations at South Bank include Clem Jones Promenade, the Cultural Forecourt, Riverside Green and River Quay.\nThe fireworks display will be set to music broadcast on radio.\nSouth Bank Parklands will be fenced, with bag checks from 10am. It will be an alcohol-free site on the day except for licensed premises. Metal cutlery, other sharp items, drink bottles with unsealed lids, scooters, bikes, pets, glass and marquees will not be permitted.\nOn-site operators will remain open during the day, while takeaway food and beverages will also be available from pop-up vendors in the Cultural Forecourt.\nThere will be more security and a visible police presence throughout the city to maintain public safety.\nAdvertisement Public transport Public transport is the best way to travel to South Bank Parklands for the fireworks, with free travel on Translink buses, trains and ferries from 8pm on Sunday to 5.30am on Monday.\nHowever, Cross River Rail work will impact the Beenleigh and Gold Coast train lines during this time.\nRoad closures will occur around South Bank Parklands, South Brisbane and the CBD.\nPolice have advised people to plan ahead and take advantage of public transport, taxis and ride-sharing options if drinking.\nCar parks Loading With street parking rules set to change from 4pm on Sunday until 2am on Monday along major inner-city thoroughfares, public car parks will be in hot demand.\nThe South Bank Parklands car park will be accessible via Glenelg Street for both entry and exit, and exit only via Tribune Street towards Vulture Street.\nThe Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre car park will be accessible via Merivale Street only.\nWeather forecast Loading Brisbane: Queensland’s capital is set for a maximum of 30 degrees, with a partly cloudy day and a high chance of showers, most likely in the afternoon and evening and a potential for a thunderstorm. Up to 8 millimetres of rain possible.\nFor the latest forecasts, including any weather warnings, check the Bureau of Meteorology website .\nGet the inside word on the news, sport, food, people and places Brisbane is talking about.

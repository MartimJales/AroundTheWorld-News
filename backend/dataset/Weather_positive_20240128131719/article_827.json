    "text": "Meteorologists expect that Aspen will receive much-needed snow in January after two months of relatively dry conditions mixed with some precipitation. Megan Sanders, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Grand Junction, said an “unsettled pattern” is due to develop in the western United States this week, which will place Aspen in the most likely path for storms. Sanders said Aspen could get around 1 to 3 inches of snow on Thursday and potentially more than that on Saturday, with the possibility for yet another storm on Sunday or Monday. Though Aspen will see precipitation, she said the storms will likely be more favorable for areas south of the Roaring Fork Valley. She said the NWS predicts that the system will continue to bring precipitation to western Colorado for the following week as well. Cory Gates, meteorologist for local weather service [aspenweather.net](http://aspenweather.net), said he is generally looking forward to an uptick in snowfall this month. Gates said the highest likelihood for solid snowfall will come after Jan. 12, when low-pressure systems are expected to arrive as U-shaped troughs conducive to broad regional snowfall. January snowfall could cap off a two-month slow spell for Aspen ski areas. Gates, who calculates historical snowfall averages for each month at three Aspen ski mountains (all but Buttermilk), said the mountains saw roughly 70% of their combined average snowfall last December and November. Typically, the mountains each receive around 50 inches of snow in December, which dipped to around 37 inches last month. Sanders called the last two months “slow” in terms of precipitation. For Gates, the biggest factor behind the dry period is “closed lows” — low-pressure systems with abnormal circular shapes that have often missed the Roaring Fork Valley in recent months. Gates said most low-pressure systems have U-shaped troughs and extend across the intermountain west, distributing snowstorms over large areas. Closed lows, on the other hand, cover a much smaller geographic area and often track to the west and south of Aspen. Gates said he is confident about the days following Jan. 12 because that is when some low-pressure systems traveling through Aspen will arrive in their typical U-shaped figure. “When we get toward the 12th and onward, we have a few normal-looking troughs, which is a good sign,“ Gates said. Gates said he’s hoping for 2 feet at the three ski areas from Jan. 6-20, adding that he realistically hopes for 60 inches through the whole month. If Aspen ski areas get around 80 inches in January, it would return the whole November-through-January period to its historical average for snowfall. Gates said an 80-inch January may be a tall order, but it’s possible. In general, he said the three Aspen ski areas have seen average snowfall this winter, although that average was boosted by a huge storm in October before the mountains were open. Without October, he said it will take a 60-inch January and average monthly snowfall for the rest of the season to deliver an average snow year at Aspen ski areas. Across the Western Slope, Sanders said this winter started dry, with this year’s snowpack failing to keep up with last year’s numbers. Data included in a Dec. 28 snowpack report from Basalt-based nonprofit the Roaring Fork Conservancy showed snowpack at 88% of normal throughout the Roaring Fork River basin and 69% of normal for the Colorado River basin above Lake Powell. Gates said it’s far too early to tell how the whole winter will shake out. He noted that huge, season-defining storms often roll in as late as March and April. “It's a long winter here. Just remember that,” he said.",

    "text": "Blankets donated to Central Florida families as temperatures drop With this cold snap in Central Florida, we can't forget about our neighbors who have no place to sleep at night. The Christian Service Center in Parramore has given out more than 500 blankets this week to people who are homeless. Officials say they had only seven blankets left last night. The center is usually closed on Saturdays but says it was crucial to open the doors to prepare for the chilly holiday weekend. The community stepped up Saturday by donating items to keep families in need safe and warm. \"Just with the cold tonight and people asking last night and I didn't have anything to give them. We just had to come out and just distribute blankets today,\" said Eric Gray, the executive director for Christian Service Center for the Homeless. \"Far too many adults and children will be on the streets tonight. Far too many adults over the age of 75. Far too many children under the age of 12.\" The center will be back open in Parramore Sunday to collect and distribute blankets. People can stop by with their donations any time between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Top headlines:",

    "text": "GEORGE TOWN: Penang's Chingay Festival parade kicks off with over 40 teams participating despite a sudden rain which came pattering in the evening.\nShowcasing the state's rich tapestry of multicultural heritage, the members from various associations and groups gathered at 7pm next to Padang Brown in Jalan Johor before forming a long line as they paraded through the city.\nThey passed Jalan Penang, Jalan Burma, Jalan Transfer, Jalan Sri Bahari, Jalan Penang, Jalan Chulia and Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling before ending at Lebuh Light, about four hours later.\nThroughout the parade, the Chingay teams performed stunts of balancing giant flag poles on their foreheads and chin, while others complimented the celebration with dragon and lion dance, stilt walking, as well as performances by school bands.\nAt about 11pm, when the rain had stopped, the event culminated with a fireworks show at Lebuh Light, in front of the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce building.\nAmong those present were Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow and Penang tourism and creative economy committee chairman Wong Hon Wai.\nThe name “Chingay” is derived from the Mandarin term for “the art of costume” and “masquerade” in Hokkien.\nIt was reported that the Chinese in Penang first performed Chingay in 1919 in celebration of the birthday of the Goddess of Mercy organised by market traders and other Chinese communities in the city.\nThey carried the idol of the goddess and 12m flags around George Town to eliminate the disease plaguing the area then. The procession has since transformed from its original purpose to the promotion of tourism and was recognised as an intangible cultural heritage by the National Heritage Department in 2012.\nOpen Modal ×",

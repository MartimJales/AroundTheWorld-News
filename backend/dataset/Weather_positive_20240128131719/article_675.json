    "text": "Last updated: 02.01.2024, 10:00 a.m.\nBy: Nico Bauer\nCommentsPrint Share\n3, 2, 1 – go! With a jump into the six-degree cold lake, these four die-hards started their new year. © Farmer\n86 brave people jumped into the six-degree cold water at the Moosburg bathing - including some mayors.\nMoosburg – For many people, New Year's Eve is boozy and joyful, and for some, New Year's Eve is wet and frothy. This year, 86 brave people ventured into the water at the Moosburg bathing at the Aquapark. Most of them came out at record speed.\nFor the 22nd time, the Moosburg Water Rescue Service invited to a bathing day on the first day of the new year. And once again, the big goal has been postponed once again, because the most exciting question of the first event of the year is whether you will make it to 100 bathers. Once, at 98, they were close. With 86 brave people, there was not much missing to reach the sound barrier. Once again, there was a group from Poland.\nMore spectators and 86 swimmers at the swim in Moosburg \"This time there were significantly more spectators than in previous years,\" said Stefan Aigner, chairman of the Moosburg Water Rescue Service. The Moosburg campaign once again had the highest density of mayors with Josef Dollinger (Moosburg) and Gerhard Betz (Nandlstadt). While Dollinger swam a lap in a relaxed manner, Betz – traditionally in a Wacken shirt – was back on land quite quickly. \"I actually wanted to swim a bit,\" Betz said later, \"but this time it was just too cold.\"\nOutside temperatures that are too warm The conditions with an air temperature of six degrees, a water temperature of six degrees and an icy wind were a violent combination. Stefan Aigner, head of the water rescue service, was also able to easily explain the pitfall of the higher temperature: \"When it's minus ten degrees outside and four degrees in the water, going in feels like a bathtub.\"\nHigh water level, closed jetty This time, by the way, the bathtub was overflowing. The water level at the water park is about one and a half meters above normal. This is due to the increased groundwater and a water level that has never been seen before. That's why the bathers ran across a meadow into the water and were already so deep at the gravel area that you could hardly stand. Therefore, the partially submerged jetty of the water rescue service was closed this time.\nBathing fun in a Wacken shirt: Nandlstadt's mayor Gerhard Betz ventured into the cold water like 85 others. © Nico Bauer",

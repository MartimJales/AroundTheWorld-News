    "text": "Sunday River in Maine has one of the best snowmaking systems in the country. Why shouldn't they, it's the east coast, they may need it! Jokes aside, Sunday River has \"the most powerful and technically advanced snowmaking system on the planet and a dedicated team of snowmakers who commit to producing the best conditions around-all season, every season.\" In the last 10 years, they have spent millions of dollars on new snowguns, and apparently, they are going to good use. With over 2,000 snow guns, 80 miles of pipe, 30 miles of hose, and 2,200 hydrant stations, Sunday River has its snowmaking dialed. In a post to Instagram just today, officials at Sunday River reminded everyone to \"thank a snowmaker\" because \"with 255 acres open, and more trails coming online daily, [Sunday River] is currently home to the most open terrain in New England.\" Sunday River was also the first ski area in Maine to use snow guns to make snow without relying on Mother Nature. At the time, the snowmakers found that \"the guns on the market were not producing enough snow to meet the demand, so in the early 80s, the SR 7 was invented in-house.\" While this model is no longer cutting-edge technology, and the HKD Method snowgun heads are the new norm, Sunday River strives to stay on top of making snow! With the storm on the way to drench the East Coast with that fresh pow, will Sunday River still be blowin'? Guess you have to load up the truck and find out. Either way, there's powder in store for East Coasters, and we're pretty dang stoked for you! Don't miss another headline from POWDER!

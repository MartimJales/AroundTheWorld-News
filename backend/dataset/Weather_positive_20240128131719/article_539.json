    "text": "'Pleasant' temperatures expected as South Canterbury welcomes new year The new year will bring nice weather, following a cracker last Friday of the year when temperatures hit the mid-20s in South Canterbury. While people flocked to Caroline Bay during the afternoon to cool off and enjoy the sun and the water, MetService meteorologist John Law said the forecast for New Year’s Day and beyond would mean cooler weather for the region. “They will be cooler days, but the daytime temperatures will still be pleasant,’’ Law said. The forecast for January 1 was a high of 22C with showers clearing to fine in the evening, while the following day it would be fine again with a few showers developing later in the day. A high of 20C was expected. Wednesday’s temperature was expected to reach 19C with showers, while Thursday it was expected to get to 22C, with a few showers. Law said the overnight temperatures were expected to drop following warmer nights over the weekend, and that would be a welcome relief to many residents. The Caroline Bay Association will also be hoping for good weather for the second week of its annual carnival, with the Boxing Day opening delayed because of heavy rain. Carnival activities this week include the Big Dig, on Monday at 12.30pm, and the children’s pet parade, on Tuesday at 11.30m. Egg and spoon races will begin at 11am the following day. The 13-day carnival finishes on January 7 with a 90-minute show from 2pm at the Caroline Bay Soundshell.",

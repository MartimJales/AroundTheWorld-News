    "text": "At the end of 2023, the earth is cold and snowy, and a new page on the time scroll is being turned at an accelerated pace without the slightest delay. Looking back on the old years, the surging memories in the depths stretch for thousands of miles... This year, \"the light boat has crossed the Ten Thousand Mountains\". From January 2023, 1, the new coronavirus infection will be adjusted to \"Category B and B Tube\", and the Shenzhen Port will resume normal personnel exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong in an orderly manner. \"The Bay Area is back buried\", the longing turned into a long-lost meeting, and it was a spring full of hope. After the baptism of fighting the new crown epidemic, China has been reborn in the flow. A large number of Mainland visitors come to Hong Kong by XRL. (File picture) photo by Li Zhihua This year, the fireworks in the world were restored. A video, a barbecue, an event, a music festival...\"just go\" and \"special forces\" travel mode is emerging, and more and more \"Internet celebrity\" cities are emerging. Familiar and friendly bustling, the domestic consumer market is full of vitality and urban governance is constantly advancing. Aerial photography of Zibo's \"barbecue rivers and lakes\". Photo by Liang Ben This year, the spirit of the Chinese nation was engraved. Affected by Typhoon \"Dusuri\", the flood in Zhuozhou, Hebei Province was raging, and the streets of Zhuozhou at that time had license plates from various provinces, including Anhui, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong... When one side is in trouble, the support of all parties is staged again; Four months later, after the Jishi Mountain earthquake in Gansu Province, a rescue team from Zhuozhou, Hebei Province, rushed to the earthquake area, \"just wanting to repay this love\". In August 2023, a number of fire and rescue forces rescued and evacuated people in Wharf Town, Zhuozhou City, Hebei Province. Photo by Cui Nan This year, the world has experienced a baptism of wind and rain. The historical smoke of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been rekindled, Japan has brazenly discharged nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, the farce of the United States has been staged in turn, and the second harsh winter after the full-scale escalation of the Ukraine crisis, the outlook is still unpredictable... It may not be a peaceful time, but we are fortunate to be in a peaceful and strong motherland. On October 10, local time, in the Palestinian Gaza Strip, after Khan Younis was bombed by Israel, people inspected the wreckage of the destroyed building, and the dove representing peace stood on the rubble. This year, we are striding even higher. The Chengdu Universiade and the Hangzhou Asian Games, the spirit of youth rises on the world stage, and digital intelligence treads the waves, reflecting China's sharpness; The Belt and Road Initiative ushered in the 10th anniversary of the important node, and the heavy achievements benefited the world and demonstrated China's demeanor; The proposal of the \"Global Civilization Initiative\", another international public good, further conveys China's answer to the question of the century and demonstrates China's magnanimity. The picture shows the opening ceremony of the Chengdu Universiade. Photo by China News Service reporter Mao Jianjun \"It seems to be the most ordinary and strange, but it is easy but hard.\" In the era of great change, we still watch the \"unchanged\" in our hearts. So, we saw the takeaway brother running around the city, jumping into the river to save people with an ordinary body; In the snowy season in various places, I saw the security uncle who wrote the word \"Fu\" on a sleigh on the snow; In the race against time for earthquake rescue, I saw medical staff risking their lives to welcome the birth of the \"earthquake baby\"... This year, there are thousands of encounters and thousands of partings, but what remains unchanged is that those moments of love and touching will meet you again in the next bright morning. In 2024: May your dreams be illuminated by light; May your road ahead be long and windy; May your harvest shine brightly. Don't worry about the wind and snow ahead, spring is just around the corner, stride forward! Facing the wind and snow, the spring is clear. Wishing you, me, and us, 2024, Happy New Year!

    "text": "The BREC park on Church Street in Zachary holds a special place in the hearts of many residents. Take Mayor David McDavid and Police Chief Darryl Lawrence, for example. Both played basketball in the park’s gym in their younger days. McDavid grew up participating in other activities at the park, including a program taught by his mother, who is still involved with BREC today at 82 years old. As elected officials, McDavid and Lawrence value the park as a space providing much-needed recreational and educational opportunities for Zachary residents. “This facility means a lot,” McDavid said. But the 7-acre complex, which BREC purchased from the Zachary Lions Club in 1977, has endured challenge upon challenge in recent years. BREC was in the early stages of a $1.5 million project to update the park when heavy rains struck the area in August 2016, filling the recreational center with 2 feet of water that damaged the basketball court, floors, walls and electrical system. BREC spent the next couple of years working with FEMA and got the facility back up and running in 2020. It briefly reopened — only to be shut down at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Then, later that year, a rainstorm flooded the building again, and BREC had to replace flooring and remediate mold. With all repairs and upgrades finally complete, BREC and local elected officials celebrated the revamped Church Street Park at a ceremony Dec. 27. The park actually has been open for about a year, but scheduling difficulties delayed the ribbon-cutting event. “It’s wonderful to see the rebirth, the rebirth and the rebirth of it,” said state Rep. Barbara West Carpenter, D-Baton Rouge. “You have a beautiful facility now — one that the residents of Zachary can be proud of.” In addition to the updated gym with its new basketball court, amenities include meeting and activity rooms, storage space, a pavilion, a playground, an outdoor basketball court and a lighted, multipurpose field. Perhaps most significantly, several people at the ceremony said, the gym now has air conditioning — something that many BREC recreation centers do not have. Lawrence recalled playing basketball in sweltering conditions during visits to the facility when he was younger. “This air conditioning will be a big help,” he said. Leaders noted the important role that BREC parks play in the community. “A successful parks system and recreation amenities are the cornerstone to a successful community,” said Ambre DeVirgilio, a member of the Zachary City Council whose district includes the Church Street Park. “So many kids in this community have benefitted from BREC. … It means a lot to see this facility come back,” McDavid added. The Church Street Park project is just one of several that BREC is wrapping up in the northern part of East Baton Rouge Parish, said Reed Richard, assistant superintendent of BREC. The agency is continuing highly anticipated renovations at the Greenwood Community Park and Baton Rouge Zoo near Baker. It also is catching up on repairs and making upgrades to other parks that sustained flood damage in 2016, including Baton Rouge’s Howell Community Park and, in Central, the Lovett Road Park and Frenchtown Road Conservation Area. Richard is looking forward to welcoming residents to new and updated facilities in 2024. “This is going to be a year of ribbon-cuttings,” he said.",

    "text": "MOBILE, Ala. (WTKR) â€” Old Dominion women's basketball began Sun Belt play on the right foot with a 62-56 win over South Alabama on the road Saturday afternoon. Trailing by four at halftime, the Monarchs surged in the third quarter with a couple of threes by Brenda Fontana, tying the game up at 34-34 just 1:23 into the second half. From that point, ODU outscored South Alabama 15-8 the rest of the quarter with an Ivi Nikolova three at the 2:50 mark giving the silver a 41-39 lead. Delisha Milton-Jones' group continued to grow the lead in the final ten minutes of the game, with a Jordan McLaughlin layup extending the advantage to 53-44 with 7:24 left to play. A comeback attempt by the Jaguars was thwarted time and time again by the Monarchs, who also handed Delisha Milton-Jones her 100th career win. McLaughlin finished the game with 12 points to lead ODU, while En'Dya Buford and Kaye Clark chipped in ten a piece. ODU gets out to a 1-0 start in the Sun Belt and improves to 9-2 on the season. They'll return to Norfolk with a game against Louisiana on Thursday.",

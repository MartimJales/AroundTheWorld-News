    "text": "A man was arrested after fleeing an attempted carjacking that was thwarted by a good samaritan with a hammer, police said.\nOn Feb. 24, Naugatuck officers were alerted to a reported carjacking around 5:30 p.m. at the Fulling Mills Deli at 281 Prospect Street, according to the Naugatuck Police Department.\nOfficers arrived on the scene and learned that the suspect, identified as 23-year-old Guy Guery of Naugatuck, had attempted to steal an occupied vehicle before a passerby armed with a hammer intervened, police said.\nAt that point, Guery ran into a wooded area by the business. Officers quickly created a perimeter and located Guery a short distance from the scene, according to police.\nAfter resisting arrest, Guery was taken into custody and charged with attempted carjacking by robbery, second-degree reckless endangerment and interfering with an officer/resisting arrest. He is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail and was arraigned at Waterbury Superior Court on Monday.\nGuery was also found to have several outstanding failure-to-appear warrants, which were served during the arrest.\n“The Naugatuck Police Department commends the collaborative efforts of its officers who brought a swift resolution to this incident,” the department said in a statement Thursday.",

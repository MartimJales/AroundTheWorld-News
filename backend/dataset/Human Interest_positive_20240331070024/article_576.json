    "text": "PLANT CITY, Fla. â€” The Florida Strawberry Festival will look and sound a little different this year.\nLast spring, we reported on a tragic car crash that killed Randy Scott, his wife Jill Scott, and Jill's sister, Judy Cook.\nAll three played big roles in the festival for decades. Randy Scott, in particular, was known as \"the voice of the festival,\" singing the national anthem each morning, 'Happy Trails' every evening, and making daily announcements.\nRandy and Jill's daughter Angel Carter said the festival has not just been a family tradition, but a shared passion.\n\"We were always here growing up, so I don't know anything other than being here,\" she said. \"Everybody in the family wanted to be involved at some point. As we became adults, we came every day and we enjoyed working and being involved.\"\nOn the opening day of the first Strawberry Festival she's spent without her parents, Carter was feeling an array of emotions.\n\"It's a little bittersweet. I've got a lot of emotions today. But it's where they would want us to be. They wouldn't have wanted us to quit, and we did think about it, and ultimately, we decided to continue on,\" Carter said.\nAs the family presses forward, the festival is honoring their past. They are showcasing Randy and Jill Scott's legacy through a plaque at the new history center.\nStrawberry Festival President Kyle Robinson said, \"The festival's a success because of the people that have come before us. We stand on their shoulders, and that's why the Strawberry Festival is so special.\"\n\"I went in last night and took a look at it and I cried honestly. I was honored that they would do that,\" Carter said.\nMeanwhile, the new \"voice of the festival\" said Randy Scott was his best friend. It's his 26-year-old grandson, Seth Carter.\n\"We know we won't be able to replace them, but it's our hope to do justice to the roles they've held for years,\" Seth Carter said over the P.A. system as he introduced himself to the fair-goers.\nAs for the national anthem, for now, Randy Scott's voice lives on through a recording.\n\"I think they would be very shocked and very humbled that they've been honored in this way,\" Angel Carter said.\n The Florida Strawberry Festival runs through March 10 in Plant City.",

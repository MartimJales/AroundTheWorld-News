    "text": "By Lauren Branch Correspondent ,\n2 hours ago\nWallace resident Howard Boney had been holding on to a collection of pieces sent to him by his past student Lorey Hayes. She is a known actress who has never forgotten those who have helped her along the way. Early in her career she sent Boney a package that showed photos and highlights of her career. Boney said he felt proud to know that one of his students “made it big”, and he wanted to share it with the community during Black History Month.\nBoney is a 30+ year retired teacher from Wallace Rose Hill High School and said he loved every minute of being a teacher because of all the different students’ lives he got to impact. He taught civics and stated that Hayes was one of the students that he remembered very well. Even though he does not remember the exact year she was in his class, he said he remembered her vibrant personality, and watching her sing in chorus and perform with the theater club.\nOver the year Hayes has made a name for herself playing in a variety of shows, plays, and movies including but not limited to:\nFILM\nDream GirlsTendrilSunsplashThe Glass ShieldThe Puppet\nTV SHOWS\nJudging AmyFamily LawSister, SisterThe Guiding LightAll My Children\nTHEATER\nInacent BlackHomeMiss Ever’s BoysLipstick, Chilli, Grits & GracePower Play\nHayes is also a writer, director, workshop developer, and teacher. One of her most legendary pieces was the play Haiti’s Children of God which came out in 2011.\nAfter graduating from Wallace Rose Hill High School, she then attended North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro where she studied history and professional theater. According to her online actress profile her favorite bible verse is “So faith, hope, and love abide, these three: but the greatest of these is love”. Her favorite quote is “each new day, each new moment is an opportunity to choose again” from Rosemary Rhea.",

    "text": "CHARLESTON, Arkansas — Carter Beason and Hemi Herrera may seem like typical sixth graders, but if you ask how old they are, there is more than one right answer. “It’s cool being a three-year-old in sixth grade,” Hemi said. “Yeah, you’re different,” Carter added. “There's something about being three and everyone else around you is 12.” Coincidentally, the two friends were both born on Leap Day in 2012, so this is only the third time they’re celebrating their true birthday. Both boys said they usually celebrate on Feb. 28 or March 1. While Leap Day is especially important for people like Carter and Hemi who only get to celebrate their actual birthday every four years, it is also important for keeping our calendar on track. While there are 365 days in a calendar year, it takes the Earth a little bit longer than that to make a full rotation around the sun. “There happens to be 365 days and almost a quarter day, a little bit less, in the solar year, so we have to adjust that if we want to keep our days lined up with our year,” astronomer and University of Arkansas physics professor Julia Kennefick said. The extra quarter-days add up over four years to make Leap Day. “It’s about keeping everything in line so that our year doesn't get out of whack, essentially, and so we're not celebrating Christmas in June,” Kennefick said. Because Feb. 29 comes around every four years, it is an unlikely birthday, and it is even more unlikely to share it with a friend. Both Carter and Hemi said they think this will be a fairly typical birthday for them: celebrating with cake and going out to eat. They are already looking ahead to their fourth birthday when they’ll be able to drive: “Going downtown in the ‘Rari, age 4,” Hemi said.

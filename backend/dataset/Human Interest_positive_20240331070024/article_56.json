    "text": "[One Comm Volunteers With Meals On Wheels](https://bernews.com/2024/02/one-comm-volunteers-meals-wheels/) [One Communications](https://bernews.com/tag/onecommunications/) employees volunteered with Meals on Wheels this month. A spokesperson said, “One Communications reaffirms its dedication to community service by once again supporting Meals on Wheels throughout the month of February. Volunteers returned to make a positive difference in the lives of community members in need. “As a community-driven organization, the company prioritizes initiatives that directly benefit the community. Partnering with Meals on Wheels allows One Communications to address critical issues such as food insecurity and social isolation among vulnerable populations. Throughout the month, volunteers rolled up their sleeves to prepare and package nutritious meals for delivery to seniors and individuals with disabilities.” Niall Sheehy, One Communications CEO, said, “We firmly believe in the power of community and the importance of lending a helping hand to those in need. Our involvement with Meals on Wheels reflects our commitment to making a meaningful impact and inspiring positive change within our community. Thank you to Meals on Wheels for having us and allowing us the opportunity to give back.” The spokesperson said, “Meals on Wheels is a non-profit organization that delivers nutritious meals to seniors, disabled individuals, and people with mobility issues who are unable to prepare meals for themselves. “If you are interested in volunteering at Meals on Wheels, please fill out the Volunteer Applications Form online or contact Volunteer Coordinator Miriam Maccoy; [click here](https://mealsonwheels.bm/volunteer-form/) for further information.”",

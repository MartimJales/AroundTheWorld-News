    "text": "Fellow Canadians Rylan Wiens, Nathan Zsombor-Murray reach 10m platform final Canada's Pamela Ware put forth a solid performance and advanced to the women's three-metre springboard final at the World Aquatics Diving World Cup on Thursday in her hometown of Montreal. The 31-year-old Ware, who won silver in Montreal last year, was coming off a disappointing 25th-place finish at the world championship in Doha earlier this month. She also missed her final dive in the synchronized event alongside partner Mia Vallee as Canada failed to secure a quota spot for this summer's Paris Olympics. Ware placed sixth out of 17 in the preliminary round while Calgary's Aimee Wilson also moved on with a 12th-place finish at the Olympic Pool. Three-time world championship gold medallist Chen Yiwen of China came first. Amelie-Laura Jasmin, a 19-year-old from Montreal, placed 13th and missed the cut in her first-ever World Cup event. Later Thursday, Rylan Wiens of Pike Lake, Sask., and Nathan Zsombor-Murray of Pointe-Claire, Que., advanced to Saturday's men's 10-metre platform final. Wiens finished seventh while Zsombor-Murray came ninth. Benjamin Tessier of Blainville, Que., was outside the top 12. Men's three-metre and women's 10-metre preliminaries follow on Friday, along with a team event final. Watch live coverage of the Montreal Diving World Cup stop on CBCSports.ca, the CBC Sports app and CBC Gem, continuing Friday at 1:27 p.m. ET. The event features over 120 divers — including 12 Canadians — from more than 20 countries.",

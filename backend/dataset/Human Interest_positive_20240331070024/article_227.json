In a strategic move to celebrate Mother's Day, the high street beauty giant is offering the 100ml bottles at an astonishing price of £22, down from their regular £66. This revelation, initially shared by an elated customer on the Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK group on Facebook, has sparked a shopping spree among perfume enthusiasts eager to snag the luxury scent at a fraction of its usual cost.\nExceptional Savings for Beauty Lovers\nThe discount on Vera Wang's Princess perfume is part of a broader initiative by Boots to make luxury beauty more accessible in the lead-up to Mother's Day. Shoppers can enjoy a 20% off on all premium beauty and No7 items with a special Sun Vouchers discount. This promotion offers an excellent opportunity for customers to purchase high-end beauty and skincare products at significantly reduced prices, whether they're searching for the perfect Mother's Day gift or simply looking to treat themselves to some of the best beauty products on the market.\nOnline Exclusive Deal\nHowever, there's a catch to this enticing offer.

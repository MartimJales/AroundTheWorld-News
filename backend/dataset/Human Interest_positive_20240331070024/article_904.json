    "text": "Ashley Benson has had her first child with husband Brandon Davis.\nThe ‘Pretty Little Liars’ actress, 34, announced on Thursday (29.02.24) she had given birth, and shared a photo online of her newborn’s hand wrapped around her thumb alongside a pink heart emoji – but didn’t add any more information about the baby.\nIt was first reported in October Ashley and her oil heir partner, 43, were expecting their first child, and in January the actress bared her growing baby bump in a photoshoot for Ladygunn magazine’s digital issue.\nShe told the publication she felt her connection with Brandon had been “immediate”, adding: “I was just like, ‘I think I’m gonna marry you’.”\nGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\nREAD NOW\nAshley also added she knew becoming a parent was going to “change” everything in her life.\nShe said: “I’ve had to go away from what I’m known for. And with the birth of my child, the rebirth of my career is going to happen too.”\nAshley revealed she was engaged to Brandon in July 2023 when she showed off her massive diamond ring, which was estimated to have cost $800,000, on her Instagram Stories.\nShe said in the post Brandon was her “best friend”, adding: “I love you.”\nThe couple secretly married last autumn, with Ashley’s mum revealing they had got hitched by sharing photos online of the couple’s wedding bands.\nIt’s unclear when Ashley and Brandon started dating, but People reported in February 2023 they had “a lot of mutual friends” and got along because they are “both super fun and very social people”.\nThe couple’s romance made headlines after the end of Ashley’s long-term relationships with rapper G-Eazy, 34, and 31-year-old model Cara Delevingne.\nShe initially kept the relationship with Brandon secret and insisted she prefers a “private” love life.\nAshley told Cosmopolitan in 2021: “It’s more sacred that way. I think it’s best not to be over-exposed, and you can really protect your relationship if you’re not exploiting it.”\nBefore making her relationship with Brandon public, Ashley opened up about her hopes of one day starting a family.\nShe told People in 2019 she was “obsessed” with babies and wanted “like, 25 kids”.\nAshley said at the time she didn’t plan to get pregnant “anytime soon”, but admitted she had already been shopping for her unborn kids.\nShe added: “I just got three vintage T-shirts for my future children. I’m just going to keep them until they can wear them. I will go crazy… it’ll be fun.”",

    "text": "By Monique Ledesma ,\n3 hours ago PASCO, Wash. - Even the youngest members of our community can make a big impact when it comes to saving lives. When it comes to a cardiac event, seconds are crucial, and that means anyone who can start CPR before First Responders get there can make the difference between life and death.\n\"Every minute they don't have oxygen going to the brain, that's brain damage happening,\" said Ben Shearer, who is with the Pasco Fire Department. Shearer said teaching young people what to do in an emergency helps them not be scared when they need to stay calm the most.\n\"I know it's kind of a scary concept, little kids doing CPR, but it's been proven over and over again where it doesn't matter who's there, whether it's an adult or a child,\" Shearer said. \"If we can get them to do CPR, even children can be that one to save the life.\"\nFourth and Fifth grade students at Maya Angelou Elementary in Pasco got the chance to work with Pasco Fire and learn what CPR is and how to do it in an emergency.\n\"I think providing the skill for kids will allow them to feel more confident, to feel like they could do something if they needed to get help and sustain somebody until help arrived,\" said Valeri Espinoza, who is a tech teacher at the school.\nMaya Angelou Elementary CPR Training\nAna is a 4th grader at Maya Angelou. She said she is excited to have a class like this in school because it helps her feel prepared. \"I feel good because now if anybody in my family will have a heart attack, I can help them breathe so nothing will happen to them,\" she said.\nEspinoza said with classes like this one, students also learn about other jobs in the community and may get inspired to start a journey in a career.\n\"It's really great when schools can work with community members to bring individuals in,\" she said. \"Kids can learn about a job like a fireman and also some of the things that they do in their job.\"\nCPR can be done to the songs \"Stayin' Alive\" and even \"Baby Shark\". You can also download the PulsePoint App on your phone, which will take you step by step through the process.\nShearer also said the Tri-Cities has the best cardiac survival rate in all of Washington. He said this is due to fire departments in the community frequently training people on CPR and what to do in a cardiac emergency.\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY APPLE VALLEY NEWS NOW. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

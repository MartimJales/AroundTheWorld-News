    "text": "An Olentangy Berlin athletic trainer is being praised after she used a defibrillator to save a man having a heart attack at a basketball game this week. Olentangy Local School District officials and Olentangy Berlin coaches are praising Kelsey Newman, the school's athletic trainer , saying she \"should be recognized for her professionalism and heroic act under dire circumstances.\" Olentangy Schools Superintendent Todd Meyer said he has heard stories about the need to have qualified training staff on site, \"because you never know when an emergency could arise.\" \"Kelsey’s calm head, quick thinking, and immediate action truly saved someone’s life,\" he told the Dispatch. \"We are grateful to have trainers like her serving our student athletes and Olentangy community on a daily basis.” According to a letter from Mark Nori, the head football coach, the incident happened Monday before the OHSAA Division III girls basketball district semifinal game between Harvest Preparatory School and Pleasant Local Schools . During the national anthem, a man collapsed in the stands. While nearby spectators rushed to help, Newman also rushed to the scene and performed CPR, Nori said. Then, Newman administered an automated external defibrillator (AED), which revived the man and restored his pulse until first responders could arrive and transport him to Riverside Methodist Hospital. An AED is used to help those experiencing sudden cardiac arrest, according to the American Red Cross . It's a sophisticated, yet easy-to-use, medical device that can analyze the heart's rhythm and, if necessary, deliver an electrical shock, or defibrillation, to help the heart re-establish an effective rhythm. A person’s chance of surviving drops by up to 10% every minute a normal heartbeat isn’t restored, the Red Cross states. After the incident, the game went on as planned. At halftime of the game, Nori said someone familiar with the man said he had said that Newman's medical attention saved his life and that he was now scheduled for surgery. The man's daughter told Olentangy staff that he was expected to make a complete recovery. Nori said Newman and others who helped were \"instrumental in the literal saving of a life.\" \"Having personally worked with (Newman) for the past six years, I am not only proud to have her as a part of our athletic team, I am grateful for the job she performs each and every day,\" Nori said. @Colebehr_report Cbehrens@dispatch.com",

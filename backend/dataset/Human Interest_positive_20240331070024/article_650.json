    "text": "AUGUSTA-- In Maine, the right to vote and participate in elections is a key tenet of protecting the democratic process. That right is extended to everyone regardless of race, religion, or disability.\n\"So here in Maine, we do our best to make voting not only safe and secure but also accessible to everyone.\" says Secretary of State Shenna Bellows who is in charge of elections in Maine.\nWhile the system isn't new, Secretary Bellows sometimes hears from people who didn't know the technology existed until Election Day. \"In Maine, we use what's called the Express Vote. It's a machine that helps people vote if they have a disability that precludes them from filling out the paper ballot.\"\nSecretary Bellows adds that the accessible voting machines are never connected to the internet, and while they are designed to help people with disabilities, the technology is available for everyone. \"Anyone can use the accessible voting machine, so perhaps a viewer at home doesn't have a disability but they have arthritis in their hands or they just don't like feeling things out, and they want to use a touch screen. The accessible voting system is for everyone; anyone can use it. It does produce a paper ballot because paper ballots are the gold standard in election security.\"\nWe asked Secretary Bellows to walk us through the process of using the ExpressVote machine. \"First, there is a blank ballot that you insert into the activator. Today, we're obviously not actually voting. So do you like Bugs Bunny, Daisy Duck, or Scooby-Doo? I'm a big fan of Scooby-Doo. You touch your selection and then you go to the next button. Ah, there's a citizen initiative in this one. 'Do you favor allowing talking animals and names to wear top hats and bow ties in public?' Yes. So now I can review my selections. I can verify what I did. I voted for Scooby-Doo for President of the United States, and I voted yes on the referendum question regarding whether animals could wear top hats. Now I print that card. Now, that is the card that I placed in the machine. So you then remove it. You can see it voted: President of the United States and the citizen initiative.\"\nThe presidential primary election in Maine is next Tuesday, March 5th,\n Corey Bouchard Author email Follow Corey Bouchard ",

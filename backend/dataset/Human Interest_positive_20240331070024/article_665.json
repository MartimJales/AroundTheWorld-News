    "text": "For Sydney Brule-Head, interning with a local wildlife rehabilitation centre was the perfect stepping stone on her way to becoming a veterinarian. At Salthaven West, a wildlife rehabilitation centre in Regina, new internships open every year to provide the next generation of animal lovers the opportunity to learn about wildlife veterinary care. Brule-Head knew when she was four years old that she wanted to be a veterinarian. After she completed Salthaven West's internship program, she said it confirmed that was what she wanted to do with her life. \"When I saw that Salthaven was hiring, I thought that would be just the most amazing job, the most amazing experience,\" Brule-Head told host Stefani Langenegger on CBC Radio's The Morning Edition. \"For sure, it's absolutely solidified what I want to do with my life.\" LISTEN | Salthaven West interns share how the wildlife rehab centre impacted their lives: Salthaven West has been rehabilitating wildlife from across southern Saskatchewan since 2014. It tends to about 1,400 wildlife patients each year. Natalia Slipak, the clinic manager at Salthaven West, said the clinic is looking for three interns to join the team this April. \"We're looking for two animal health-care assistants and one medical receptionist,\" Slipak told The Morning Edition. \"It's really fun; it's very interesting and it definitely changes your view of wildlife.\" Animal care associate duties include assisting with the daily care of the wildlife who come into the rehab facility. The medical clinic reception interns work on the administrative side while also getting to learn about Saskatchewan's native wildlife. American robin fledglings were among the birds treated by Salthaven staff this summer. (Submitted by Natalia Slipak) While Slipak says experience with wildlife is an asset, it is not strictly necessary. \"My favourite thing, honestly, is seeing the change in the view they have regarding wildlife,\" said Slipak. \"Getting to see the whole process from an animal coming in injured or orphaned or being completely scared to overcoming an injury and then getting to the point to release. I think it's very rewarding and I love having interested people around and answering questions and talking everything wildlife.\" For Brule-Head, releasing baby crows was one of the most memorable experiences she's had while interning with Salthaven. \"We actually found that the crows that were still in our care in our outdoor flight pen were feeding the crow that we had released through the bars. They were sharing their food,\" Brule-Head said. Brule-Head also recalls rescuing an injured bird and taking it to Salthaven for care. \"I took him straight to Salthaven and the little guy recovered in a couple days, which is amazing. I got to see the whole process.\" Anyone aged between 18 and 30 years old who has an interest in animals is encouraged to apply to the 2024 Salthaven West internship program. March 15 is the deadline to apply for this year's internships.",

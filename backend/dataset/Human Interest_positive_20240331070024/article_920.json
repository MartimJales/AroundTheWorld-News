    "text": "LEXINGTON, S.C. â€” Eight churches in Lexington are teaming up to host a community health and safety fair this weekend, and they want to see you there! It's their first event since the pandemic ended.\nFolks in Lexington and other parts of the Midlands will have the opportunity to get free clothes, food and medical help.\nOrganizer Anita Boland is the director of health ministries and congregational care at Lexington Presbyterian Church.\nShe said her church has been hosting a health and safety fair since 2009. And over the years, Boland explains more churches have joined in on their effort through word of mouth.\nShe tells News 19 that she learned there was an overlap with New Bethel AME Church down the road, also serving the community's health needs.\n\"Why don't we coordinate our efforts, so that helped us better meet the needs of the people of our community and we said this is just a door to open up to be able to minister to people physically, emotionally and spiritually together,\" Boland said.\nOne of those individuals served was James Bannerman, who lives in Lexington. He learned he had diabetes and high cholesterol at the health fair years ago.\n\"It was kind of hard for me to go there to get all this testing done, but when I found out about my health, I think my health is more important, and I keep on, I go to the doctor every six months and get myself checked with my diabetes. They're doing good the doctor said,\" Bannerman said.\nBannerman tells News 19 he's thankful he decided to go. The screenings will include blood pressure, vision, hearing, dental, cholesterol, HIV and TB.\nWhile the event is being hosted at the Lexington Leisure Center , this event is not tied to the Lexington County Recreation and Aging Commission.\n\"You never know what's going on with your body. You can have high blood pressure, you can have a stroke,\" Bannerman said.\nThe event is Saturday, March 2, 2024 from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Organizers say Spanish interpreters will be available at the health fair, as well as Spanish medical forms.\nRelated Articles Lexington County road to temporarily close for construction Sewage truck will soon be removed from downtown Lexington Some mayors upset as Lexington County's road, drainage maintenance agreement with cities, towns expires",

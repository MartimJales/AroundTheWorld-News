    "text": "State Senate District 3 candidate Christopher Cabaldon has been endorsed by Democratic Clubs within this district, which includes the United Democrats of Southern Solano County, Northern Solano Democratic Club, Progressive Democrats of Benicia, Rio Vista Democratic Club, West Sacramento Democrats, Woodland Democratic Club, and Sacramento Stonewall Democrats. Besides this impressive list, he has also received the endorsement of Planned Parenthood Northern California Action Fund, Reproductive Freedom for All California, Sierra Club, and Equality California. With the current threats to reproductive freedom, LGBTQ rights and climate change, he is needed to keep California’s laws strong. But what makes Cabaldon an impressive candidate is his history of being the longest serving mayor of West Sacramento, during which the city received distinction as “America’s most interesting small city” and “America’s most livable small city” as well as recognition as one of the world’s “21 Smart Cities to Watch.” Under Cabaldon’s leadership, innovative initiatives were started, including guaranteed universal access to preschool, urban farms, free college for local students, sustainable land use, building market and affordable housing at one of the fastest rates in California — all while shrinking its footprint and protecting even more habitat and agricultural land. He also served as the chair of the Jobs, Education and Workforce Committee at the U.S. Conference of Mayors and appointed to the National Advisory Board by president Obama, which was chaired by Dr. Jill Biden, for America’s College Promise. All this makes him a great choice for the next state Senator and worthy of your consideration. — Andrew Smith/Benicia",

    "text": "Lubbock firefighters gear up for 48-hour charity run LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Many in the Lubbock community are lacing up their running shoes for the 4X4X48 charity run. This race is unique, challenging participants to run four miles every four hours for an entire 48-hour period. “Anyone who participates in it, it’s going to be mentally and physically challenging,” Lubbock Firefighter Noah Sager, who is participating in the run, said. Sager stated his job requires constant training. “I think what were asked to do on the job does help in this aspect,” Sager said. However, he does not underestimate the challenges of this race. “A little bit of extra training on your own time does help.” The [Lubbock Professional Firefighter Association](https://www.facebook.com/LPFFA972) has a goal of $5,000 that will go towards firefighter wellness. “In the past, firefighter mental health has been overlooked,” Sager said. “We’re trying to be proactive for our current brothers and sisters in the department.” These firefighters put their lives on the line for the community everyday, so this is the community’s chance to give a little in return. “Counseling, treatment centers and other mental health endeavors,” Sager said. “So, any money that we receive goes to that and so I just say thank you.” Sager said those who want to join the run can just jump in when they see these firefighters. “Any member of the public is welcome to join,” he said. “There’s no fee to register or participate, just hop in with us, but donations are encouraged.” Those interested can join the firefighters on their run at Tech Terrance park during these days and times. Or, they are taking donations [here.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/lpffa-4x4x48-marathon?utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_content=control1&utm_medium=copy_link_all&utm_source=customer) Copyright 2024 KCBD.

    "text": "The new refurbished HFC Bank Stadium tracks is a platform to promote unity, diversity, and inclusivity in all aspects of our national life. Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka highlighted this statement after officially reopening the new HFC Bank Stadium tracks this afternoon. During the event, the Prime Minister was welcomed with a traditional i sevusevu by the National Youth Band and was also presented on behalf of the Minister of Sports. Rabuka says this is a testament to what can be accomplished when all Fijians work together towards a common goal. He says we are not only celebrating the reopening of these iconic tracks but also acknowledging the commitment and dedication of all those involved in making this refurbishment a reality. He adds the reopening of the new stadium tracks will ensure our athletes will give their best in the upcoming Coca-Cola Games that will be held in the coming months. Minister for Youth and Sports, Jese Saukuru says the reopening of the new tracks at the HFC Bank Stadium marks a significant milestone in our commitment to promote youth and sports development while fostering a culture of sports excellence in our communities. Saukuru also acknowledges the support from the Government for their support by funding the project and ensuring that the project is successfully implemented.

    "text": "When it comes to raising money for animals, PETA loves to be creative. And that’s when our [PETA Pack](https://petapack.peta.org/) program often comes into play. The PETA Pack is a group of runners who participate in various races—from full marathons to 5Ks—in the name of animal liberation. This year, six of our runners will take on the United Airlines NYC Half marathon on March 17. This 13.1-mile race will begin in Brooklyn, make its way over the historic Manhattan Bridge and up FDR Drive, wind through Times Square (one of only two times it’s closed each year), and finish in Central Park. Each of our vegan runners will raise funds for PETA causes close to their hearts. We’ll introduce you to one of our runners each week during the lead-up to the big race. [Meet Christine Graham!](https://petapack.peta.org/283/peta-pack/144416/running-for-teachkind) She’s running to support PETA’s humane education division, [TeachKind, ](https://www.peta.org/teachkind/)and its vital work to foster compassion and empathy in students. It provides educational materials and presentations to encourage kindness in students and works with educators and other school staff to help replace animal dissection with effective humane methods, incorporate healthy vegan options in cafeterias, and much more. Teachers are highly influential on their students, and by promoting compassion for all sentient beings at a young age, they can help create a kinder future. By donating to Christine’s fundraiser, you’ll help expand TeachKind’s important impact.

Communication Awards celebrated the trailblazing achievements of the women who have raised the bar for the rest of the comms world through their work developing high-performance, relentlessly creative work across internal and external communications, HR, public relations and beyond\nRagan Communications hosted an awards luncheon on Feb. 29th at New York City’s City Winery, where attendees took time to celebrate each other in the face of both global and internal trials to overcome today’s most urgent challenges.\n“This year’s class of Top Women exemplifies the heights that women can reach across our industry when they come together,” said Diane Schwartz, CEO of Ragan. “It’s an honor to recognize their power and celebrate their ability to enact meaningful change through their efforts.”\nRagan also had two Hall of Fame honorees in attendance, who spoke to crowd about their takeaways from their accomplished careers.\n“What this industry really needs is great people, and we need one another,” said Marian Salzman, senior vice president at Philip Morris International. “What we need is a workplace that embraces differences, champions strengths, and guides us all through it together.”\nSusan Donlon, chief communications officer at KeyBank, acknowledged that her induction as a Hall of Famer wasn’t an individual pursuit.\n“I want to thank my team because they always bring professionalism

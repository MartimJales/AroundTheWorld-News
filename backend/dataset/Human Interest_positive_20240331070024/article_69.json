    "text": "Weekly Atlanta food tour returns to BeltLine, donates to animal rescue organizations ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - After a winter break, the massively popular BeltLines Atlanta Food Tours start up again on March 2 for the fourth year — including a food crawl for dogs! Every Saturday, tour participants get to taste food and enjoy street art on the BeltLine. The company is also expanding its “Barks and Bites: Doggie Crawl on the Atlanta BeltLine” event to twice a month, with a portion of the proceeds going toward animal rescue organizations like PAWS Atlanta, LifeLine Animal Project and Rescue Me Georgia. “The Atlanta BeltLine is reshaping Atlanta, making it a more walkable and desirable city,” said Nicole Gustin, founder and CEO of BiteLines Atlanta Food Tours. “We love showing off the trail to tourists and metro Atlanta residents by giving them a curated sampling of some of the city’s most popular restaurants, and sharing stories behind the creative street art that earns Atlanta a national reputation.” The three-hour tour starts at [Krog Street Market](https://discoveratlanta.com/things-to-do/shopping/krog-street-market/), a food hall and shopping area in a restored factory. Participants ultimately visit four restaurants and enjoy six tastings. At the doggie crawl, dog-friendly restaurants serve bites for pets while owners enjoy appetizers and craft beer. There’s even a special “dog brew!” The crawl also includes shopping at dog boutiques and giveaways from local and national dog brands like Piedmont Bark, Wolfgang Bakery & Grooming and Dulces de Luna.

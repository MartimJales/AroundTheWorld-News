Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below F34.SI Watchlist WLMIY\nWilmar International Limited ( SGX:F34 ) shareholders (or potential shareholders) will be happy to see that the Co-Founder, Khoon Hong Kuok, recently bought a whopping S$1.1m worth of stock, at a price of S$3.32. While that only increased their holding size by 0.08%, it is still a big swing by our standards.\nView our latest analysis for Wilmar International\nWilmar International Insider Transactions Over The Last Year Notably, that recent purchase by Co-Founder Khoon Hong Kuok was not the only time they bought Wilmar International shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of S$15m worth of shares at a price of S$3.69 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than S$3.32 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Khoon Hong Kuok.\nKhoon Hong Kuok bought 18.12m shares over the last 12 months at an average price of S$3.67. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\ninsider-trading-volume Wilmar International is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nInsider Ownership For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Wilmar International insiders own 6.8% of the company, worth about S$1.4b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nStory continues So What Do The Wilmar International Insider Transactions Indicate? The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Wilmar International. That's what I like to see!

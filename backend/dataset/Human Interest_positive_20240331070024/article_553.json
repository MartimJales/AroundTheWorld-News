    "text": "How did you two meet? I met my husband Drake on Facebook and spoke for weeks before meeting in the hallways at our high school.\nWho proposed? My husband proposed in early August. He asked my parents to take me shopping and while I was gone he redecorated the house in sunflowers (my favorite flower) and watermelon ring pops. When I got home I followed a path made of sunflower petals and there he was down on one knee.\nWhen did you start planning? I started planning about a year and a half before the wedding. I waited until I graduated from college.\nDid you have a vision/theme? I wanted a timeless look. I wanted people to see the photos and not be able to tell if it was done today or 10 years ago.\nWhy did you pick your venue? It was the best venue for my desired aesthetic. It was just perfect.\nDid everything go according to plan? I believe everything did go according to plan. I have been dreaming about this day my entire life and it did not disappoint.\nWhat was the most challenging part of planning your wedding? I would say that the hardest part was planning the food. We were lucky to have such competent people in charge of the food. They helped make our day so much easier.\nWhat’s one memory you’ll always cherish from that day? I would say the one moment I will cherish most is the calm before the storm. My husband Drake and I got to sit together and talk before the ceremony. We took a deep breath and it made everything feel much less stressful.\nWhat advice would you give to other couples as they plan their weddings? Don’t stress the little things. The only thing that matters is the person across from you.",

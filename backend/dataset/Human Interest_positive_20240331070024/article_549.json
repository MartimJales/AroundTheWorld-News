    "text": "On Thursday, father and son duo Scott and Trace Kimple picked up used furniture around Lee in the Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity ReStore truck.\nWhat You Need To Know Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity has a ReStore, selling used furniture\nAll the proceeds from store sales go towards housing projects\nThey will usually ask a community if they have any resaleable goods to donate them for sale, then they go out and pick them up, free of charge\nThe ReStore picks up items Wednesday through Saturday The organization’s store sells used furniture, and all the proceeds go towards housing projects.\n“Once they’re sold, [it] goes into us being able to produce affordable housing,\" said Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity CEO, Carolyn Valli. \"The other great thing about the ReStore is we literally keep tons of things out of the landfill.”\nOne of the organization’s mottos is \"recycle, reuse, reduce, rebuild.\" They will usually ask a community if they have any resaleable goods to donate them for sale, then they go out and pick them up, free of charge.\n“The money that we raise goes towards building homes for people with lower incomes, so it feels good to do something good for the community.\" said assistant manager, Trace Kimple.\nOnce the furniture is back at the store, they clean it up and fix any minor details before bringing it out onto the floor.\nWhen an item is sold the money goes to houses being built in the area by Habitat. They aim to build these houses for working families needing a hand up.\n“Our goal every year is to raise enough money to put in three foundations for homes,\" Valli said. \"So right now, we have five homes under construction between Pittsfield and Dalton. We have another five hopefully going up next year in Pittsfield, and we are working on a 20-unit development in Housatonic. So, obviously we need a lot of funds for a lot of foundations in order to make these projects work.\"\nThe Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity ReStore picks up items Wednesday through Saturday, along with accepting donation drop-offs. Anyone interested in donating an item is asked to call ahead of time.",

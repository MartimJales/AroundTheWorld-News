Speakers and participants from across the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, and others engaged in virtual talks about the importance of speaking up in women's personal and professional relationships and for others and causes she cares about to create change where change is necessary.\nThe Make A Difference Award was presented at the end of the conference by Ms. Wilkov to recognize the USTA for the US Open's 50 Years of Equal Prize Money for women and men milestone in 2023.\nAs the producer and presenter of the Make A Difference Award during the Global 2024 January Speak Up Women Virtual Conference, Wilkov said, \"As a huge fan of tennis worldwide since I was a little girl, the USTA has always held a special place in my heart. When they reached this incredible milestone of 50 Years of Equal Prize Money for women and men in tennis at the US Open, they reminded us that the USTA and the US Open was the first sporting event in history to offer equal prize money for women and men competitors. It would take the other grand slams more than 30 years to offer the same. There was no question in my mind that I was going to award the Make A Difference Award to them. As I said in my talk, now, more than ever, it's our time to speak up.\"\n\"It is truly an honor for the USTA to be recognized with The Make a Difference Award,\" said Nicole Kankam, USTA Managing Director, Pro Tennis Marketing and Entertainment. \"We are proud that, thanks to the trailblazing efforts of the iconic champion Billie Jean King, the US Open was the first of tennis' major events to award equal prize money in 1973. In celebrating that momentous milestone, we salute all of the pioneering women in our sport who have worked so hard to level the playing field for all. This honor is truly an honor we share with all of them.\"\nConversations at the Global 2024 January Speak Up Women Virtual Conference included discussions on the importance of speaking up at home, in the workplace, and for others and causes she cares about plus talks about speaking up on purpose, being you and how to stop playing small, authenticity, curiosity, speaking up after trauma, having tough conversations and tough talk in tech, manifesting your destiny, infusing humor into the workplace, protecting your potential, unleashing your full expression, propelling your venture, that how you show up without saying a word matters, and speaking up when it counts most. The conference concluded with a rousing talk from Kimberly Mylls and Ms. Wilkov as they relaunched their principles and philosophy about putting boys before business from their book Boys Before Business which they are rereleasing in February 2024.\nMs. Wilkov emceed the conference and leads the Speak Up Women Community platform, the #1 search result according to Google out of the more than 1.5 - 3 trillion results daily for the search term \"Speak Up Women,\" above Forbes, The Harvard Business Review, CNBC, Diversity Woman Magazine, The UN, The California Conference for Women, and more.

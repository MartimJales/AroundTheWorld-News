    "text": "The 1984 film got people to cheer for fatherless outsider Ren McCormack as he fought for the attention of Ariel Moore, the wild daughter of Rev. Shaw Moore. But most of all, it got people to want to join in when Ren gleefully shouted, “Let’s dance!”\nThe Line Mountain Theater Department will present “Footloose the Musical” Thursday, Friday and Saturday, at 7 p.m.\n“Footloose the Musical,” based on the movie, was produced on Broadway in 1998, with lyrics by Dean Pitchford and music by Tom Snow. It follows the same storyline of the rebellious Ren moving to a small middle-American town where dancing is forbidden. Outraged, Ren gathers his classmates together to question Rev. Moore and the town council and demand a real prom with rock-and-roll dancing.\nBeverly Lash, theatre director at Line Mountain, said this year’s musical will honor the school’s 16 graduates, and she hopes to send them off with support from the community.\n“Yes, we are losing 16 students from the pit, crew, and cast. I want the audience to see how much the students have contributed to the program,” she said. “I hope the audience will understand one of the main themes from the show, which is listening to your children, and forgiveness.”\nAddalyn Shingara, a senior, plays the role of Ariel.\n“Ariel is a teenage girl trying to figure out life after dealing with the loss of her brother while her parents attempt to heal from the trauma,” Shingara said. “She is the pastor’s daughter, but even though she’s in the choir on Sunday mornings, she also has a bit of a nixie side.”\nShingara enjoys portraying Ariel’s complicated personality.\n“It’s fun to play her because she’s extremely spunky and always stands up for herself,” she said. “She doesn’t care what other people think of her, and that’s something I admire about her.”\nSenior Levi Ferster plays Ren McCormack, portrayed by Kevin Bacon in the original movie.\n“Ren McCormack is a strong dancer who is very sarcastic. He is a smart boy that is also stubborn and rebellious,” Ferster said. “When he tries to change the town’s law about dancing, he genuinely cares about his classmates, not just for the sake of his own benefit. I enjoy playing Ren the most because of his dance moves and high tenor voice. This has pushed me to extend my vocal range and build my confidence to dance at the degree that he does.”\nKatie Heim, also a senior, plays the role of Rusty, portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker in the film version.\n“As a character, she is funny, a little bit ditsy, very talkative, a loyal best friend to Ariel, and a little lost as she finds herself navigating through her feelings for Willard,” Heim said, referring to Ren’s new best friend, Willard Hewitt.\nHigh school musicals always seem to involve some unexpected moments that the cast and crew will remember for a long time. Heim recalled watching Ryleigh Beer fall off of the stage during a rehearsal, but added reassuringly, “She was okay.”\n“A funny story during the production of “Footloose” was when Cadence and I were practicing roller skating in the school hallway,” Ferster said.\nAnother unforgettable moment involved a spontaneous dance that ripped everyone up.\n“One of the funny stories I have about working on ‘Footloose’ was when me and Levi (Ren McCormack) were rehearsing ‘Almost Paradise’ on stage, and Derek (Willard Hewitt) ran on stage dancing to be funny and ripped his pants in front of everyone,” Shingara said.\nLash marveled at the fact that February 17 was the 40th anniversary of the original movie version of “Footloose.” Much like the students in the story, she’s seen her own students grow and support each other.\n“I love to see how the cast reaches out to each other and are inclusive,” she said. “I always tell students to leave their egos at the front door. It doesn’t matter if you have a leading role or a non-speaking role. They are all in this together. Respect is a priority.”\nCindy O. Herman lives in Snyder County. Email comments to her at",

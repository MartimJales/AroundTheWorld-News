(Franciscan Health) By Mike Nolan | | Daily Southtown PUBLISHED: February 29, 2024 at 4:41 p.m. | UPDATED: February 29, 2024 at 6:38 p.m.\nNewborns made their big leap into the world on Leap Day at hospitals in the south suburbs and Northwest Indiana.\nAt Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, mom Akalya Pittard and dad, Malik Jordan, welcomed Malik Jordan Jr., into their lives at 6:55 a.m., according to Advocate. A baby boy, Malik Jordan Jr., was born to parents Akalya Pittard and Malik Jordan on Leap Day, Feb. 29, 2024, at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn. (Advocate Health Care)\nThe couple live in Oak Lawn, and the boy was delivered at 4 pounds, 12 ounces, and 17 inches in length, according to the hospital. The couple have a 1-year-old daughter, Amiri.\nMalik Jr. arrived four weeks ahead of schedule, according to Advocate.\nThe boy’s mother realized Wednesday night she was going into the labor and the couple rushed to the hospital, where she was in labor for three hours, according to Katie Dahlstrom, an Advocate spokeswoman.\n“She never expected to have a Leap Day baby,” she said.\nAnother newborn, Alfred “AJ” James Poellnitz IV, was also a month early, delivered at Advocate Christ at 8:10 a.m. and weighing 6 pounds 11 ounces and measuring 19 inches. Alfred “AJ” James Poellnitz IV was born on Leap Day, Feb. 29, 2024, to Alfred James Poellnitz III and Kristyn Rein, of Alsip, at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn. (Advocate Health Care)\nParents Alfred James Poellnitz III and Kristyn Rein live in Alsip, and mom had recently read a social media post about Leap Day babies, Dahlstrom said.\nKristyn is already thinking ahead to celebrating AJ’s birthdays on/off years, and is looking at Feb. 28, Dahlstrom said.\nFor the Leap Day babies, newborns were swaddled in a special Advocate Health Care blanket, she said.\nFranciscan Health Family Birth Centers in Northwest Indiana also welcomed Leap Day babies.\nCarly Dobin of DeMotte gave birth to her daughter, Molly, at 12:41 a.m. Thursday at Franciscan Health in Crown Point.\nCarly’s late grandfather, who passed away last February, was also a Leap Year baby and would have been 96 Thursday, according to Franciscan.\nThe baby weighed 7 pounds, 6.5 ounces and measured 19 inches, according to Franciscan.\nAlso at the Crown Point hospital, Lindsay and Todd Norton of Lowell welcomed the birth of a boy at 7:54 a.m. He weighed 7 pounds, 15 ounces and measured 20 inches, according to Franciscan. Lindsay and Todd Norton, of Lowell, Ind., welcomed a baby boy on Leap Day, Feb. 29, 2024, at Franciscan Health in Crown Point, Ind. (Franciscan Health)\nSara and Jacob Faso of Dyer welcomed a girl, Penelope, at the Crown Point hospital. She was born at 1:52 p.m. weighing 8 pounds, measuring 19 inches. Sara and Jacob Faso of Dyer welcomed a daughter, Penelope, on Leap Day, Feb. 29, 2024, at Franciscan Health in Dyer. (Franciscan Health)\nAt the Franciscan Health hospital in Dyer, T’Anda and Caleb Harris of Hammond saw the birth of their Leap Day baby, Mahla, at 5:22 a.m. She weighed 7 pounds, 7 ounces and measured 20 inches. T’Anda and Caleb Harris, of Hammond, welcomed a daughter, Mahla, on Leap Day, Feb. 29, 2024, at Franciscan Health in Dyer. (Franciscan Health)\nTo celebrate their “leap” into the world, newborns at Franciscan were dressed in onesies adorned with a cartoon frog along with matching knitted frog stocking caps, said spokeswoman Lauri Keagle.\nIt is estimated only about five million, or around 0.07%, of the total population, have a Feb. 29 birthday. The chance of being born on Leap Day is one in 1,461, less likely than flipping a coin and coming up “heads” ten times in a row, according to Advocate.\nOther notable Leap Day births include Pope Paul III, singer and actress Dinah Shore, hip-hop artist Ja Rule, motivational speaker Tony Robbins and Chicago-born actor Dennis Farina, according to the New York Times.

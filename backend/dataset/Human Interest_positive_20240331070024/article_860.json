    "text": "\"Fairytales of the Public Garden,\" a solo exhibit by Williamstown artist Laura Christensen, will be on view from March 4 to April 12 at The Mayor’s Gallery in Boston City Hall as part of a program celebrating women’s artistry and Women’s History Month. A reception will be held at 6 p.m. Thursday, March 7, for all of the City Hall exhibiters. Christensen's exhibit features 12 new artworks inspired by the Boston Public Garden. She created the artworks by drawing or painting directly onto the surface of antique photographs. Christensen’s artwork has been featured at Kidspace at Mass MoCA, The Art Complex Museum in Duxbury, Bennington Museum, Simmons College in Boston, and The Rotch-Jones-Duff House in New Bedford. She received Mass MoCA’s “Assets for Artists” Professional Development Grant and a 2021 Finalist Award in Photography from the Artist Fellowship Program of the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

    "text": "Have you ever wondered what the cast from the famous sitcom \"Good Times\" is up to now? You could ask Jimmie Walker (JJ), Bern Nadette Stanis (Velma) and Ralph Carter (Michael) when the iconic TV stars celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show during a special visit at Wilmington Public Library on Friday, March 15. No tickets or registration are required for this free event. Seating is first come, first served. The moderator for the event is actor Ernest Lee Thomas , best known as “Raj” from the ‘70s sitcom “What’s Happening!!” Here's what you need to know about the cast of \"Good Times,\" and more. What is 'Good Times' about? Set against the backdrop of the 1970s in Chicago, \"Good Times\" followed the struggling Evans family, led by James (John Amos) and Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), who were trying to keep their heads above water. The couple lived in the projects with their three children: JJ (Jimmie Walker), Thelma (Bern Nadette Stanis) and Michael (Ralph Carter). Despite the Evans' fight against poverty, the family still managed to keep a smile on their faces, hence the title: \"Good Times.\" The sitcom \"Good Times\" ran from (1974-79) and is considered one of the most iconic Black TV shows for its mix of comedy and ability to tackle social issues. Janet Jackson was on 'Good Times' Years before the King of Pop, Michael Jackson's little sister Janet Jackson became a pop icon, earning her acting stripes as a child star playing the role of Penny on \"Good Times\" (1977-79), per IMDB. Penny was a sweet little girl who was abused by her mom, and the child was eventually saved from her troublesome mother when she was adopted by Willona (Ja'net Dubois), the Evans' upbeat and stylish neighbor. Janet Jackson won't be in attendance at this \"Good Times\" cast event. But it's inevitable her name will be brought up. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer will stop by the Wells Fargo Center in Philly on June 26 as part of her \"Together Again\" summer tour. Who is Jimmie Walker? The brightest star of \"Good Times\" is comedian/actor Jimmie Walker for his portrayal of JJ, a boney artist who often introduced comic relief into the show. He was the eldest of the three Evans children and generated laughs from the audience due to constantly roasting his sister Thelma for her bad cooking skills. JJ's famous catchphrase is \"Dy-no-mite!' Walker has appeared in countless films and TV shows like \"Everybody Hates Chris\" and \"Scrubs,\" plus the comedian still tours. But his role as JJ has overshadowed any other project he's done. Who is Bern Nadette Stanis Fans of \"Good Times\" still marvel at the youthfulness of actress Bern Nadette Stanis (Thelma), who turned 70 years old in December, according to IMDB. Stanis, like her other \"Good Times\" co-stars coming to Delaware, is most recognized from the show for her role as JJ and Michael's attractive sister, who loved to tease her goofy brother JJ. But again, the actress continues to charm fans with her beauty, and her supporters aren't shy about stating as much on social media. Last Halloween on Instagram , she posted a video of herself wearing a catsuit, along with her two daughters. Her supporters nearly lost their minds. \"Thelma stay Fine, geesh!\" one thirsty fan said. \"Why are you still this fine???\" another added. Who is Ralph Carter? Ralph Carter played a key role as the young boy Michael on \"Good Times,\" the baby of the Evans family. Michael was a child activist and smart kid whose character was used to smuggle in Black history and political commentary. Wilmington Public Library (10 E. 10th St., Wilmington) at 6 p.m. Friday, March 15. Admission is free. Visit Facebook.com/WilmingtonLibraryDE , wilmington.lib.de.us or call (302) 571-7400.",

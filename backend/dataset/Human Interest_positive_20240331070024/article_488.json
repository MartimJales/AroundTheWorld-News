    "text": "Melbourne Orlando International Airport Announces Winners of the Veterans Salute Contest\nBy\nSpace Coast Daily // February 29, 2024\nBREVARD COUNTY • MELBOURNE, FLORIDA – To celebrate the return of American Airlines’ nonstop service to Washington, D.C. Reagan International Airport (DCA), the Melbourne Orlando International Airport (MLB) hosted a Veterans Salute Contest to honor hometown heroes with a trip to the nation’s capital.\nThe community was invited to nominate local veterans for a chance to win two roundtrip airline tickets and a $500 Visa gift card.\nNominee profiles and written narratives were posted in an online gallery for a public vote.\nA panel of judges, all of whom are veterans, scored the top-five submissions based on the compelling nature of the story, emotional impact, and how well each narrative reflected the veteran’s dedication to service and sacrifice. Scores were combined and tallied, and the end results were incredibly close.\nAs a result, the airport elected to award two prize packages to the top-scoring individuals.\nMLB is proud to announce the dual winners of the Veterans Salute Contest:\nRick Racich – U.S. Navy Veteran, 1970-1974\nRick served two years in Vietnam as a doorgunner in the Navy squadron known as the Seawolves. The Seawolves are renowned for being the most decorated squadron in American Naval Aviation history. After retirement, Rick became a teacher and is often invited to speak about his experiences in Vietnam to students. Rick was nominated by his wife, Lucretia Lonis.\nKevin Sweeney – U.S. Army, 2003-2022\nKevin served the U.S. Army for 21 years, including three deployments to Iraq. During his career, he earned numerous medals and the Bronze Star for meritorious service in a combat zone. Beyond his military service, he and his wife have served as foster parents to multiple children. Kevin was nominated by his daughter, Kady Sweeney.\nThe airport congratulates the two winners and wishes to convey sincere gratitude to all nominees for their service and sacrifice.",

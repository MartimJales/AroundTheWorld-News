    "text": "[View photographs from the Provost's Do Good Innovator Awards Celebration](https://www.flickr.com/photos/142484476@N02/albums/72177720315367205/) The Do Good Institute, in partnership with the Office of the Provost, is proud to recognize 57 incredible UMD staff and faculty with the Provost’s Do Good Innovator Award. Three faculty members from MAPP were honored among the campus community members who create, nurture, expand and amplify social impact through education, programs and research, in and outside the classroom. Brandy Espinola, Julie Gabrielli and Marccus Hendricks were nominated by their colleagues who recognized their meaningful work. The award reflects their impressive commitment to our Do Good Campus core values: Experiential Learning; Social Impact; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging; Service to Humanity; Collaboration; and Innovation. Learn more about each faculty member’s impact below: [Brandy Espinola](/people/brandy-espinola), Climate Resilience and Sustainability Program Director, Environmental Finance Center Brandy is leading a collaborative effort to implement the county-wide Climate Action Plan that she helped draft last year with multiple government departments, local nonprofits and county residents in Prince George’s County, Maryland. [Julie Gabrielli](/people/julie-gabrielli-ncarb-leed), Associate Clinical Professor, Architecture Program Julie dedicates herself to sustainable architecture, both through her professional architecture career and her teaching practice. This has allowed her to have a significant impact on the way others see the role of architecture in protecting and preserving the natural environment. [Marccus Hendricks](/people/marccus-hendricks), Ph.D., Associate Professor and Director at SIRJ Lab, Urban Studies and Planning Program Marccus is deeply committed to community-engaged research in communities of color, which are often vulnerable to natural hazards. What makes this work unique is that Marccus and his team co-develop data collection and analysis with communities and their residents, making those living in the study area also project collaborators. The university and MAPP are happy to celebrate our faculty, who have been hard at work tackling the grand challenges of our time in service of the public good. Thank you so much for all your efforts, Brandy, Julie and Marccus, to make MAPP and UMD a thriving Do Good school and campus.",

About Pink Bows Foundation: The Pink Bows Foundation, a 501c3 nonprofit based in Houston, was founded May 1, 2022, and promotes stronger safety protocols to be consistently implemented at entertainment venues, while providing safe spaces and protecting attendees to prevent avoidable injuries or death. The Foundation provided their signature Pink Bows Safe Space™ at several Houston events in 2023, including the Bayou City Art Festival and “Deck the Hall Ball” hosted by Audacy, 96.5 The Mix, and Sarah Pepper. The Safe Space can be found this Spring at the Bayou City Art Festival, Art Car Parade, Houston Pride Parade, and the Big As Texas Fest. The Pink Bows Safe Space is designed for individuals who feel overwhelmed, anxious, or uneasy, and need a mental health break. The safe space offers a quiet and calming environment where attendees can remove themselves from the chaos and relax, take deep breaths, find a peaceful spot to sit, focus on an object, listen to soothing music, or speak to a Mental Health Counselor. The Pink Bows Foundation is a tribute to the life of Madison Dubiski, who passed away at the age of 23 while attending the Travis Scott AstroWorld Music Festival. After Madison’s death, a local initiative called Pink Bows for Madison sparked an outpouring of love and support. The initiative quickly went viral and spread across the country and internationally, with thousands of pink bows being placed in her honor.

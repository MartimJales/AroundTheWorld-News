    "text": "Alaska Federation of Natives President Julie Kitka spoke during bill signings at the Alaska Native Heritage Center on Thursday, July 28, 2022. (Bill Roth / ADN)\nJulie Kitka, the longtime president of the state’s most prominent Alaska Native organization, is stepping down after 33 years.\nIn an interview, Kitka said she wants to make room for new leadership and vision at the Alaska Federation of Natives, a group that since 1966 has advanced Alaska Native interests.\n“I just thought it would be good for the organization to let new people and new ideas shape it,” she said.\nThe transition will mark a significant change for a group that has been a powerful force in Alaska politics for decades. AFN represents about 140,000 Alaskans with wide-ranging views, plus hundreds of Native corporations and federally recognized tribes.\nKitka has led the group a lot longer than any past president. She’s soft-spoken but methodical and persistent, current and former AFN leaders say. Her longtime leadership has helped boost the group’s standing among policymakers nationally, they say.\nKitka downplays her role at AFN and credits teamwork for any of the group’s successes. She said she expects to leave AFN perhaps after the U.S. presidential election in the fall, or possibly sooner. That period of time designed will allow a careful, “planned transition,” she said.\nAt her request, the group’s board has developed a succession and search committee to find a new leader, she said.\nADVERTISEMENT The 38-member board also has hired The Foraker Group to help with the transition, AFN said in a February statement . Foraker provides development services to nonprofits and tribes. The group plans to have a new president in time for its annual convention in October.\nKitka has been “a force for stability and action” for AFN and Alaska Natives, AFN’s statement said.\nKitka joined the organization as a bookkeeper in the early 1980s . She later served as a Washington, D.C., lobbyist for the group, and its vice president, before she was elected president in 1990.\n“Some of her impressive accomplishments include helping greatly expand the Native health system, advocating and pursuing policies to fulfill the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act’s vision for sustainable economies, and helping to build public-private partnerships that benefit all Alaska Native communities,” AFN said in its statement.",

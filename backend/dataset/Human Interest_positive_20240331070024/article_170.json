    "text": "This past year, the Pender FFA Chapter in Pender, Neb. has been very busy. The chapter in Thurston County has 82 members in the agriculture program and in FFA. The program’s aim is to promote agriculture safety and education in the community and the school. Within the FFA chapter, members attend many events throughout the district and also host some of their own. Some of the activities that the chapter has held so far include the annual fall banquet and farm safety day. At the fall banquet, the chapter had their Greenhand ceremony and creed speaking demonstrations, and gave new members their blue jackets. Farm Safety Day held at the end of September is always one of the biggest events that our FFA chapter hosts each year. The chapter holds the event at the Pender Public Park, where Pender Elementary students from grades 3-6 walk over to the park to partake in the day’s activities. The Pender FFA Chapter also hosts Wakefield, and Emerson-Hubbard’s third grade students, as well. People are also reading… During Farm Safety Day, students learn about farm safety with various equipment and animals. The chapter also welcomes the special safety presentations conducted by the Nebraska State Patrol, Nebraska Fire Marshal, Northeast Nebraska Public Power and Nebraska Extension-Thurston County. All of these entities, as well as the FFA members, create a fun and memorable day for all the students and presenters. On the competition side, this year the Pender FFA Chapter has had some great achievements. At the 2023 National FFA Convention and Expo, the chapter represented Nebraska in the Farm and Agribusiness Management Career Development Event (CDE,) and the team placed seventh in the nation, with Mason Bodlak and Alex Roth receiving silver awards, and Rylie Bonneau and Caleb Kelly receiving golds. Overall, Caleb Kelly made the “Top 10,” placing fourth in the nation. The chapter had success in Leadership Development Events (LDE’s) at the district level with many qualifying for state, as well. Those qualifying for state in LDEs are the Conduct of Chapter Meetings team placing second, Kaylee Schroeder in creed speaking placing first, Farris Swinton in natural resources speaking placing first, Caleb Kelly placing third and Mason Bodlak placing first in extemporaneous speaking and finally a Parliamentary Procedure team placing first. The chapter also had 10 people qualify for state in their proficiency areas. For the rest of the school year, the Pender FFA Chapter looked forward to district Career Development Events (CDEs) in Fremont, Neb. and Northeast Community College in Norfolk, Neb., on Feb. 20 and 26, respectively. The chapter is excited for the rest of the year and competing in district contests and at State Convention in April.",

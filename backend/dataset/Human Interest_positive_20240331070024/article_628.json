    "text": "Sarah Michelle Gellar has handled vampires, werewolves and more on screen with ease, but off screen, protecting her two kids is harder when they have so much technology at their fingertips. “There’s parts of [technology] that are great, and there are parts of it that aren’t,” Gellar, 46, told Us Weekly while promoting her partnership with UScellular for the Global Day of Unplugging, which is on Friday, March 1. “I love the idea that I know where they are at all times because it shows up on my phone.

That’s something that we’re still learning how to do [as adults],” she said. Though Gellar can control the devices she buys for their kids, she can’t control other kids and their phones — which can lead to some awkward situations. Gellar was shocked when one of Rocky’s friends with a phone once showed him something on the internet about her. ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ Cast: Where Are They Now? “It was actually my son one day who came home and said, oh, so-and-so has a phone or something. They looked it up and we had to explain that you can’t do that,” she recalled, adding that the school has some protections in place. “A lot of the school computers in the lower school, you actually can’t look up a lot of … More stories from [Us Weekly](/@usweekly) Join the flipboard community Discover, collect, and share stories for all your interests [Sign up](/signup) More stories from [Sarah Michelle Gellar](/topic/sarahmichellegellar) [Danica McKellar Crushed On Fred Savage During The Wonder Years, But Did They Ever Hook Up?](/topic/sarahmichellegellar/danica-mckellar-crushed-on-fred-savage-during-the-wonder-years-but-did-they-eve/a-kwZIoYY4SR6DuYF6-QG1TA%3Aa%3A3039078443-9ce348a205%2Fthethings.com) When Danica McKellar and Fred Savage played love interests Winnie and Kevin on The Wonder Years, did sparks fly behind the scenes?

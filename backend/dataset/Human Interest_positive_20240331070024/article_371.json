The theme of this year's celebration is \"Invest in women: Accelerate progress.\" The celebration is part of RWRC's biggest fundraiser of the year and proceeds will benefit the non-profit's operation. RWRC, which operates out of the Caring Place, relies on grants, donations and fundraisers and does not receive regular funding. It was founded more than four decades ago to promote women's rights, and [has been dedicated social activism ever since](https://www.richmond-news.com/local-news/richmond-womens-centre-has-long-history-of-social-activism-6008142). Some issues it advocates for include abortion rights, child care and housing, and it offers programming including computer training, English conversation and writing, a grandmothers support group and income-tax preparation for low-income families. RWRC is also holding [an online auction](https://can.givergy.com/RichmondWomensResourceCentre2024/?controller=lots&category=All%20Lots) from Feb. 26 to March 15, with items including foodie tours, whale-watching vouchers, retail vouchers and wine. The International Women's Day celebration will run from noon to 2 p.m. with reception beginning at 11:30 a.m. Tickets to the event are $65 per person plus tax and are [available online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/2024-international-womens-day-celebration-and-auction-tickets-795740861337?aff=oddtdtcreator).

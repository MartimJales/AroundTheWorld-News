    "text": "'A cancer survivor asking for change': Meet USA TODAY’s Women of the Year honoree from Ohio Michele Young is one of the nominees for USA TODAY’s Women of the Year program, a recognition of women who have made a significant impact in their communities and across the country. The program launched in [2022](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/opinion/2022/03/13/melinda-french-gates-simone-biles-women-of-year/6922631001/) as a continuation of [Women of the Century](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/life/women-of-the-century/2020/08/13/history-constitution-19th-amendment-woman-voting-rights-100-years/4939990002/), which commemorated the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote. Meet this year’s honorees at [womenoftheyear.usatoday.com](https://www.usatoday.com/women-of-the-year-2024). Cincinnati attorney [Michele Young](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/28/michele-young-breast-cancer-survivor-thats-so-cincinnati-podcast/69596930007/) knows what it's like to treat each day like it's her last. Years ago, she was told her days were numbered following a breast cancer diagnosis caught six years too late. Since then, she's worked every moment she's still breathing to make sure no other woman is ever put in that same position. In 2018, Young was [diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/11/08/2020-enquirer-woman-year-michele-young/6038397002/). The mother of five was told her cancer had likely been around since 2012 but went undetected on routine mammograms due to her dense breast tissue (a kind of breast tissue [40% of women have](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-changes/dense-breasts#:~:text=It%20is%20found%20in%20about%2040%25%20of%20women.,in%20about%2040%25%20of%20women)). At the time, in Ohio, many screenings beyond mammograms weren't covered by insurance, making it difficult for women like Young to catch breast cancer in its early stages. She was given 1 in 100 odds of survival. But Young, a Brooklyn native, is no stranger to defying the odds. Her career as an attorney has been characterized by achieving [multimillion dollar successes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/us/gabriel-taye-cincinnati-bullying.html) for seemingly impossible cases. She was part of the legal team that [secured a $3 million settlement](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/06/04/cincinnati-schools-pay-3-million-gabriel-taye-bullying-case/7533101002/) for the family of [Gabriel Taye](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2019/12/05/cincinnati-public-school-argues-its-not-responsible-for-gabriel-taye-suicide/2619146001/), an 8-year-old Cincinnati Public Schools student who killed himself after he was bullied at school. Young was also part of the pro bono effort to free [Tyra Patterson](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-giving-back-serving-23-years-prison-murder/story?id=54989828) after she spent 23 years in prison for a crime she did not commit. And right after her diagnosis, Young simply laid out her winning strategy to her doctors at the UC Health Breast Cancer Center. \"We'll save my life, and we'll change the law (surrounding breast cancer screenings),\" Young said on The Enquirer’s [“That’s So Cincinnati”](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/28/michele-young-breast-cancer-survivor-thats-so-cincinnati-podcast/69596930007/) podcast in October 2022. She did just that. She beat her cancer and entered remission in 2020. In 2022, she helped change the law in Ohio as a major force behind the [passage of House Bill 371](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/07/01/breast-cancer-bill-passes-ohio-rest-country-follow/7693741001/), which requires insurance companies to expand [access to advanced breast cancer screenings](https://med.uc.edu/institutes/cancer/coe/ohio-house-bill-371) for women with dense breasts and other risk factors. Now, she's working to introduce similar legislation on the federal level. She's teamed up with, in her words, \"the Oppenheimers of breast cancer\" to get politicians' attention, including breast cancer survivors [Katie Couric](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/08/17/katie-couric-stand-up-to-cancer-breast-cancer/70593521007/) and NBC's [Kristen Dahlgren](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/entertainment/kristen-dahlgren-breast-cancer-trnd/index.html), and Dr. Nora Disis – one of the leading minds [behind a breast cancer vaccine](https://www.bcrf.org/blog/the-progress-and-future-of-breast-cancer-vaccines-with-dr-nora-disis/). Together, they've launched the Pink Eraser Project ( [pinkeraserproject.org](https://pinkeraserproject.org/)), with their sights set on putting an end to breast cancer, once and for all. \"I'm the last woman that's going to be left for dead,\" she said. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Who paved the way for you? My family paved the way for me. My parents are the children of Jewish immigrants who survived the Holocaust. And I watched my parents' idealism. My father taught in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood and my mother taught immigrants in the Forest Hills neighborhood in Queens. And I watched as they tried to make a life for us, make a life for them against many obstacles that they couldn't overcome. They inspired me to lift obstacles for myself and others so we could all have the promise of the American Dream, which captivated my family. What is your proudest moment? In some ways, being in this interview may be one of my proudest moments. Because, five years ago, I was left for dead, told to pull out the plug. And instead, I asked myself, \"Why not spend whatever you've got left on this Earth looking out for others and doing everything you can to make a difference?\" I stayed the course, and I'm here today thinking, \"Well, maybe something really good came out of what happened to me.\" Maybe this year will be this incredible year when we can say, \"We launched the miracle, the miracle of 2024 when we all came together and declared moonshot against breast cancer.\" What is your definition of courage? I think there are many forms of courage. One kind of courage is to bear hardship and evil, bigotry and cruelty and have the courage to say, \"I can stand up to that and still be noble and kind and be the person I want to be.\" The second form involves having the personal courage to ask tough questions of yourself. And ask, \"Am I part of the problem and how do I fix myself so I become part of the solution?\" The third kind of courage, which I think I have an abundance of, is the courage to take on the world and say, \"This is wrong. Do to me what you like. I'm in, I'm staying the course, and I'm not leaving until justice is done.\" Is there a guiding principle or mantra you tell yourself? There are 86,400 seconds in a day. Each one is a chance to transform the world. Who do you look up to? I have so many heroes. I always looked up to my dad whose mom lost everyone from her family in the Holocaust. And his whole life, whether he's fighting two wars in the U.S. or teaching in the inner-city (of New York) day and night, he took care of our family. I look up to my sweet husband, Greg Young, who, as a Cincinnatian, UDF ice cream-eating guy who has never missed a Bengals game, has unconditional love for who I am as I am. And, I look up to my five unbelievably amazing kids with a mom who can sometimes be embarrassing and who is different and who has had adversity. And they've loved me to the moon and back, and I have loved them. I look up to my twin sister, who lovingly saw me through my entire breast cancer journey before she died of COVID-19 in 2022. Finally, I have to add: I look up to every single superhero comic whose pledges I have taken to memory. Because, as a child, I dreamed of rescuing others. How do you overcome adversity? Overcoming adversity seems to be my great gift. I do so with a vision of what the world could be when you overcome it and how many people you can take along with you as you go forward. I am glad that adversity has struck me over and over again because it's allowed me, so far, to come back with zealous. What advice would you give your younger self? It's not over 'til it's over. The darkest time of your life may be the beginning of a whole new chance to do good. And, kindness and love is everything. Without it, nothing is right.",

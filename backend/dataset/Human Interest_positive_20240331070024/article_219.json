    "text": "SHREVEPORT, LA – Shreve Memorial Library is joining the National Education Association (NEA) in celebrating Read Across America in March.\nNEA’s Read Across America Day is the nation’s largest celebration of reading, encouraging millions of readers, both young and old, to pick up a book and read. While Read Across America Day is traditionally celebrated on March 2, Shreve Memorial Library will celebrate Read Across America and a nation of diverse readers all month-long, with interactive storytime programs for children of all ages. All programs are free and open to the public.\nRead Across America storytime programs at Shreve Memorial Library are designed for babies, toddlers, preschoolers, children and their caregivers. Storytime programs combine reading and storytelling with songs, interactive game play, crafts and fun to encourage early childhood literacy, vocabulary development, and social skills.\nShreve Memorial Library branches throughout Caddo Parish will host special Read Across America storytimes, highlighting diverse books and characters. In addition, many storytime programs will feature children’s book classics written by Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs and Ham and Fox in Socks , as Read Across America Day coincides with Dr. Seuss’s birthday.\nLaunched in 1998 by NEA, Read Across America is guided by a committee of educators. It is the nation’s largest celebration of reading, and the year-round program focuses on motivating children and teens to read through events, partnerships, and reading resources that are about everyone, for everyone. The titles and resources featured by NEA’s Read Across America include books that students can see themselves reflected in, as well as books that allow readers to see a world or character that might be different from them.\nReport a typo on this article",

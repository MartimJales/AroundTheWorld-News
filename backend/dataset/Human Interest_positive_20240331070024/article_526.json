    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Magic Moments of Alabama surprised 17-year-old Christian Savage and his family with an all-expense-paid trip to Disney.\nChristian Savage, who was 15 years old at the time, was playing video games in June 2022 when gunfire ripped through his family’s apartment.\nSavage was given a 10% chance to survive. But after more than 100 days at Children’s of Alabama, he’s made a miraculous recovery and returned to school last fall.\nFollowing the incident, the family moved to an apartment to be in the Wenonah school district. Their apartment was robbed while Savage was in the hospital.\nHe still suffers some paralysis but has come a long way.\nOn Feb. 28, Magic of Moments paid Savage a visit at Wenonah High School to surprise Savage with a trip of a lifetime. The organization will fully fund a magical trip to Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida for Savage and his family.\nSavage was all smiles during the surprise in front of his classmates. It was a heartwarming morning and moment for all.\nWBRC LATEST VIDEO Get news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2024 WBRC.

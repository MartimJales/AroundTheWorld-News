    "text": "New Testament Christian Academy hosts Black History career fair MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) --- As Black History Month comes to a close, New Testament Christian Academy is hosting a Black history career fair focused on the areas of science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM). There are two important parts of the career fair. First students will share presentations on Black Americans who've held successful STEAM careers in history. Then they will learn more about possible future careers for themselves. The goal is to open students up to all the potential opportunities they can take as they get closer to graduating and entering high education. School officials say students are exposed to STEM and the arts on a daily basis. The career fair hopes to show them what they can do with those skills, while also celebrating important figures in Black history. \"I want them to remember the contributions of those from the past who worked so hard....to help make a way for us,\" said Renee Johnson, Academy Director. The academy is also celebrating its state report card results, which showed students tested above the 83rd percentile for English Language Arts and Math.",

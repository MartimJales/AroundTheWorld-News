    "text": "Spring is in the Air: Let’s Go Fishing! NILES, Mich. (WNDU) - It’s been a chilly day, but [First Alert Meteorologist Matt Engelbrecht](https://www.wndu.com/weather/) assures us it’s going to get warm in the days ahead! For some of us, warm weather means just one thing: fishing. That’s why WNDU 16 News Now broke free from the indoors and met up with anglers at a Niles tackle shop. On this final February Day, the St. Joseph River in Niles wasn’t a busy place unless you count seagulls congregating beside the stream. But in the days ahead, the stream will be dotted with anglers. Those anglers were visiting Rusty Hooks Bait and Tackle overlooking the river on Thursday, hoping to get some wriggling night crawlers from the bait master Al to truck in their tackle box. Tom Andrea is a fisherman who makes his angling argument succinctly. “What do you get out of fishing this time of year? Dinner,” Andrea laughed. Craig Larson will be seeking Coho salmon this weekend on Lake Michigan. “It’s the most relaxing thing you can do,” Larson said. “It leaves all your troubles at home. At work. You’re escaping into nature; it’s just your blood pressure drops. It’s just a joy to be out there.” And while ice fishing enthusiasts may be a little bummed that things never truly froze over this winter, here’s the good news: fishing right now is really good. “Fishing has picked up significantly in the last two weeks,” said Don Wilkie, an employee with Rusty Hooks. “The Steele head, which is Rainbow trout, which run in and out of Lake Michigan, they’re coming into the river now, guys are catching them. The walleye fishing is tremendous, especially underneath the dams and impoundments here in Michigan and also in South Bend as well.” And when we fish this weekend, we can take comfort in knowing the sun is the only clock we’ll heed, keeping all the time we ever needed.

    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, Feb 29, 2024 / 18:00 pm Gary Sinise, the Catholic actor who played Lt. Dan in the 1994 movie “Forrest Gump,” announced the death of his 33-year-old son Mac, the victim of a rare form of cancer. Sinise, also known for his starring role in the television series “CSI: New York,” shared the sad news this week, more than five years after Mac was diagnosed with chordoma, a rare type of bone cancer that, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chordoma/cdc-20355401?gclsrc=aw.ds&&mc_id=google&campaign=1668886049&geo=9028752&kw=whats%20chordoma&ad=323024497836&network=g&sitetarget=&adgroup=63439334126&extension=&target=kwd-1282975787974&matchtype=p&device=c&account=1733789621&invsrc=neuro&placementsite=enterprise&gclid=Cj0KCQiA84CvBhCaARIsAMkAvkKEoTQDHOtGerwHUuOyIO1uXRDPrST7oti5gMx0uNyGPOyoPAdT9JsaAnvEEALw_wcB), “usually forms in the bones of the spine or in the skull.” Since 2017, Mac, also a Catholic, worked alongside his father at the Gary Sinise Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting U.S. military veterans, first responders, and their families. On Feb. 28, Sinise shared [on the foundation’s website](https://www.garysinisefoundation.org/mac-tribute) that his family was “heartbroken” and “managing as best we can.”",

    "text": "Milwaukee Repertory Theater will break ground May 11 on the construction and renovation project that will transform its current location into the new Associated Bank Theater Center. Construction, which is expected to last through the fall of 2025, will completely remake two of the Rep's three performance spaces, as well as create a unified lobby and the new Herzfeld Foundation Education & Engagement Center to serve students. During the 2024-'25 season, the five mainstage productions the Rep normally performs in the Powerhouse will be staged in other theaters, including a fall musical at the Wilson Center in Brookfield. One reason the Rep is rebuilding its mainstage is for greater flexibility and production power, including the addition of a fly loft, which would allow the Rep to whisk scenery on and off from above the stage â€” something it cannot do in the Powerhouse as presently configured. For every other Rep show next season, including two that will be performed in Marcus Performing Arts Center's Wilson Theater at Vogel Hall, audience members will be able to park in the usual Rep parking lot and eat before the show at the Stackner Cabaret, executive director Chad Bauman said in a recent interview. The groundbreaking is scheduled on the same day as the Rep's annual fundraising gala, the Curtain Call Ball. In a statement, the Rep also announced the cost of the project is now $78 million, up from the previously announced $75 million. The increase is due to \"inflationary cost increases,\" the Rep said. The statement declares that the Rep has raised 92%, or more than $71 million, of the new goal amount. The Rep is offering seat-naming options at different price levels throughout the new Ellen & Joe Checota Powerhouse Theater, Herro-Franke Studio Theater and the Stackner Cabaret.

The Rep has dubbed this building fundraising effort its Powering Milwaukee Campaign; its current facility incorporates a historic 1898 Oneida Street Power Station, which was donated by WEC Energy Group. The complex will be named Associated Bank Theater Center; the Rep has a $10 million sponsorship agreement with Associated Bank through 2042.

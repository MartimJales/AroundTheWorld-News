    "text": "All for woof and woof for all.\nBy\n[Alexandra Blogier](/users/alexandra-blogier)\nWritten In Green / Shutterstock\nIdyllwild is an unincorporated community in Southern California. It’s one of three unincorporated communities in the San Jacinto Mountains, adjacent to Pine Cove and Fern Valley.\nIt's known for its scenery, but its unique approach to politics is also noteworthy.\nThe California town’s local government is run entirely by dogs.\nIn 2012, Idyllwild held its first mayoral elections, only no human politicians ran for office. Instead, a local nonprofit organization,\nAnimal Rescue Friends, held the elections, which spanned from June 11, 2012 until June 13, 2012.\nVotes cost $1 and all proceeds from the election went to Animal Rescue Friends. Idyllwild humans were able to nominate their pets for political office — 14 dogs and two cats ran.\nRELATED:\n15 Sweet Signs Your Dog Thinks Of You As Their Mom Or Dad Idyllwild’s pet-based mayoral election raised $31,000 for Animal Rescue Friends. The donated funds went towards Sadie's Clinic, a veterinarian service, which offered the animal community health and wellness care, including vaccines, other medical treatments, and nail trims.\nSo much money was raised that Animal Rescue Friends floated the idea of developing a lottery system that would offer financial support to those who needed to spay or neuter\ntheir furry friends.\nPhoto: Joop Snijder Photography / Shutterstock\nThe ASPCA estimates that\n6.3 million animals enter shelters annually: 3.1 million dogs and 3.2 million cats. They estimate that approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized, which breaks down to 390,000 dogs and 530,000 cats. The ASPCA also reports that 4.1 million shelter animals are adopted each year: 2 million dogs and 2.1 million cats.\nOn July 1, 2012, the mayoral race outcomes were announced, with much fanfare and celebration.\nThe Idyllwild election was won by Max, a golden retriever who vowed to serve as the first dog-mayor.\nIn his oath of office, which Max took on his dog food bowl, the furry politician pledged to “\nfaithfully execute my duties.” Those duties included promoting the town and making appearances at outdoor concerts, festivals, and the annual Independence Day parade.\nMayor Max also pledged to “speak out on behalf of the animals of this mountain, domesticated and non-domesticated.”\nRELATED:\n5 Things You're Doing That Hurt Your Dog's Feelings Without Realizing It\nMayor Max was joined by his vice-mayor, Hogan, and his all-dog cabinet members, including Inky, the “Litter”acy ambassador, Kula, the pet tourism ambassador, and Stitch, the hydrant and sanitation commissioner.\nPhoto: Petr Jilek / Shutterstock\nMax’s one-year term was extended to a second year. After his tenure, Mayor Max’s successor, Maximus Mighty Dog Mueller II, stepped in. Max II was flanked in his leadership role by two deputies — Mikey and Mitzi, who were related to the first Mayor Max.\nMayor Max II served a 9-year term. In true political family fashion, Max III, who was born in September 2022, took over, as a young yet capable dog-mayor. Meadow is the town’s current vice-mayor, alongside Max III.\nCritics might complain about the doggie-based nepotism that seems to be in play. Yet a more positive spin on the situation would be to say that Max and his descendants have clearly found their true calling in serving the people of Idyllwild.\nTheir stronghold in the puppy political sphere has raised both funding and\nawareness for abandoned animals in Idyllwild, a cause that is worth standing up for by both people and pups alike.\nRELATED:\n10 Tiny Ways To Make Sure Your Dog Knows You Love Them — In A Language They Can Understand\nAlexandra Blogier is a writer on YourTango's news and entertainment team.

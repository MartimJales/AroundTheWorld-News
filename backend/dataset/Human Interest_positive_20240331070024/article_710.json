    "text": "The donation was announced Thursday by the National Park Foundation and National Park Service. Work on the new units in Yellowstone is set to begin later this year. The Park Service will assess where to place the new homes based on an analysis of where housing shortfalls exist. The sizable donation comes as housing prices in gateway communities like West Yellowstone, Gardiner and Jackson, Wyoming, have soared.

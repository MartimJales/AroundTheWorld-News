    "text": "Applications available for Maine Youth Climate Corps grants Maine youth are passionate about climate action and want to make a difference in their local communities, according to Volunteer Maine, in a news release. To create more opportunities for youth to give back, Volunteer Maine, the state service commission, is offering up to $10,000 grants for Youth Climate Corps programs. Applications are due on or before March 10, 2024. Maine public or private nonprofits, state/county/local units of government, higher education institutions, faith-based organizations, labor organizations, federally recognized Tribes, and regional organizations that will support members entirely within Maine may apply. Funding is available for programs operating during summer 2024 or the fall semester of 2024. The focus area for this competition is land or freshwater preservation. Youth aged 14-17 are eligible to participate in Volunteer Maine-funded programs. Funding must be used to support youth programming. The grant funding may be used for program staffing and/or Corpsmember expenses including stipends, training and any other costs that may support a member’s successful participation such as transportation support or uniforms. A core principle of the Maine Climate Corps is that Corps members reflect the economic and demographic diversity of the community they serve. The Maine Climate Council recommended the creation of the Maine Climate Corps in the 2020 Climate Action Plan, Maine Won’t Wait, under Strategy H, Engage with Maine People and Communities. Maine Climate Corps programs deliver on the triple-bottom line of service: taking direct climate action in alignment with Maine Won’t Wait; developing and training the members who serve; and increasing community resilience by engaging volunteers in the service activity. Application instructions and additional information can be found at VolunteerMaine.gov. About Volunteer Maine Volunteer Maine, the Maine Commission for Community Service, builds capacity and sustainability in Maine's volunteer sector by funding service programs, developing volunteer managers and service-learning practitioners, raising awareness of the scope and the impact of the volunteer sector, and encouraging an ethic of service.

    "text": "Here's how some Kansas Citians celebrate their leap day birthdays on Feb. 29\nLeap day babies, also known as leaplings, celebrate their true birthdays once every four years. A panel of leaplings joined Up To Date to discuss how they commemorate their special days.\nBecky Janzen was born in 1952. But this year she’s celebrating her 18th leap birthday with a retro senior prom theme complete with two ‘50s classics: maraschino cherry cake and doo-wop.\nMax Sheffield is the parent of a leap baby born in 2020. While they and their co-parent typically celebrate their son’s birthday on separate days, leap day requires an adjustment.\n“I co-parent my son, so it was kind of up in the air,” Sheffield said. “In our parenting plan, I had to explain to the attorneys, ‘We need special rules on leap years.’”\nAlthough leaplings get plenty of attention on Feb. 29, which only appears on the calendar every four years, so do leaping animals, such as frogs and toads.\nKansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney used the day to spotlight amphibian conservation. Two out of every five amphibian species is threatened with extinction, but the zoo is promoting awareness and helping to revive an endangered species.\nThe\nWyoming Toad population nearly went extinct in the 1990s due to habitat decline and toxic pesticides. Now, the Kansas City Zoo is a part of an effort to breed and reintroduce the species to its native habitat.\n- Dr. Daniel McIntosh, Professor of Physics and Astronomy in the\nUMKC School of Science and Engineering\n- Becky Janzen, leapling\n- Kurt Marquart, leapling\n- Sydney Siemens, leapling\n- Max Sheffield, parent of leapling\n- Rachel Sandoval, registered dietician nutritionist and program manager for\nLifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer’s Prevention\n- Sean Putney, CEO of the Kansas City Zoo\n- Lori Ventura, Owner & Tour Operator of\nKansas City Fountain Tours",

The wider community is invited to attend the festival, which encompasses an incredible line up of events and activities, designed to celebrate, inspire, entertain, and connect seniors from across the region. The program of events has been designed around research demonstrating the '5 Ways to Wellbeing' (connection, being active, taking notice, learning, and giving), and will include; an intergenerational playgroup, senior learn to swim assessments, ukulele club, a presentation on seniors rights, a scam awareness information session, chair yoga, free technology assistance, historical walking tours, and much more! Mayor of Cessnock City, Councillor Jay Suvaal, is thrilled to support the festival and its theme this year, Reach Beyond, highlighting the importance of honouring and engaging seniors across the community. \"The Cessnock Local Government Area's Seniors Festival is a wonderful opportunity to recognise and celebrate the valuable contributions that seniors make to our community every day,\" Clr Suvaal commented. \"This year's theme, Reach Beyond, reflects our commitment to enhancing the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of our older community members. I encourage everyone to participate in the variety of activities, and to make the most of this fantastic event.\" Many of the events on offer are free, with some events requiring bookings.

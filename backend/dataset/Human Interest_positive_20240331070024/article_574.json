    "text": "On a pivotal day, February 24, the Tampa community came together at the C. Blythe Andrews Library, setting the stage for a profound discussion on the intertwined paths of Black and Palestinian Liberation. Leading the conversation were notable figures such as Deanna Joseph of the Andrew Joseph III Foundation, Lamia Moukaddam from Central Florida Queers for Palestine, and Kobi Guillory of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, with Antwan Glover moderating the event. This gathering underscored the importance of solidarity, direct action, and the enduring struggle against political repression and injustice.\nSpeakers delved into the rich history of solidarity between the Black liberation movement and Palestinian liberation efforts. From the Black Panthers' visits to Palestine to Palestinians aiding Ferguson protesters, the shared struggle against oppression was highlighted. The discussion also touched upon the significant impact of the George Floyd uprising and the Al-Aqsa Flood, marking a pivotal moment in both liberation movements. The importance of fighting back against lawmakers and politicians who ignore these struggles was a key theme, with panelist Moukaddam emphasizing the necessity of disrupting the peace of those complicit in oppression.\nCommunity Action and the Path Forward\nThe event also focused on the role of community activism and the importance of standing against systems of oppression. Deanna Joseph shared her personal struggle for accountability after the tragic loss of her son, underscoring the community's role in advocating for change and justice. The discussion highlighted the connection between local issues, such as police brutality, and international struggles, with the Tampa Bay Community Action Committee pointing out the Lakeland Police Department's support for Israel as an example of intertwined systems of oppression.\nThe panel concluded with a powerful call to action, urging attendees to remain active in the streets, support those facing repression, and maintain hope in the collective power of the people's movement. The speakers' messages resonated with the audience, emphasizing the need for direct action, solidarity, and community engagement in the ongoing fight against oppression and for liberation. This event not only highlighted the historical connections between the Black and Palestinian liberation movements but also set a path forward for continued resistance and activism.\nThe Tampa community's gathering serves as a beacon of hope and a reminder of the power of collective action in the face of adversity. It underscores the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of struggles and the necessity of standing united against oppression, regardless of geographical boundaries.",

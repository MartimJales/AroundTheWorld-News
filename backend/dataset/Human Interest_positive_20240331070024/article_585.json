    "text": "Since opening in 2023, EJI Health has provided free health services to hundreds of people across Alabama. Many patients were previously incarcerated and received no personal medical care while in jail or prison. The Montgomery Advertiser recognized the impact of the EJI Health Clinic and EJI's mobile clinic, which provides care to patients outside Montgomery, in a recent article. Alabama's health crisis Millions of people in Alabama do not have health insurance and access to health care remains a serious problem. Formerly incarcerated people are particularly vulnerable, and many coming out of prisons and jails suffer from undiagnosed illnesses that can seriously compromise their health and successful re-entry. While EJI's health clinic prioritizes care for incarcerated people, it is open to anyone unable to access health care by other means. “A Lifesaver” Montgomery native Leonard Pettiway, 67, who was released from prison earlier this year, was one of EJI Health's first patients. He described the care he received while incarcerated as one-size-fits-all care, which often left him without treatment. “When I was in jail, I did not get any help. He kept track of my illness all these years,” Mr. Pettiway said. “This place, it's a lifesaver. You will regret not being able to stand on your feet after running in this place. EJI physicians helped treat Mr. Pettiway's hepatitis C and provided him with the medications he needed to address other health problems. The EJI Health team is eager to reach more people like Mr. Pettiway, including with services offered from the EJI Mobile Clinic, which the team has delivered to day reporting centers across the state. “This is about improving outcomes for people coming out of jails and prisons, as well as improving public safety and improving public health,” EJI Director Brian Stevenson said of the project. “I think we're going to be able to establish that people who use these services, people who get the health treatment that they need, will have a much lower rate of recidivism than people who Don't do that.” For questions about patient eligibility and appointments, you can call EJI Health at (334)239-9740 or email (email protected) at",

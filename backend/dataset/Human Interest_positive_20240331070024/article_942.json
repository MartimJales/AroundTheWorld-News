    "text": "Your Favorite Emoji ❤\nDear Mommy,\nI'm trying to cheer you up today so I hope you appreciate the GIF I made for you.\nI found a scratch-off at the lotto kiosk with your favorite emoji…\nThe heart. ❤\nIt's called “Queen of Hearts.”\nDaddy is helping me scratch it off.\nWouldn't the world be a more wonderful place if we could all have that as our favorite emoji?\nI'm sorry if I don't win anything on it but I hope it helped you smile & laugh a little bit.\nIt only cost $5.00.\nBut even if 5 bucks helped you giggle a little today, it will have been worth it!\nMaybe this will be stupid or dumb to others when they read it, but making you feel joy in your heart again is more important to me than what others think.\nBTW, I just want you to know that I never thought you were stupid or dumb or ugly or whatever it is that mean people always call you.\nIt's just that you happen to be a little different, that's all.\nMaybe some people don't understand what the word different means… 💁\nLove you the MOSTEST,\nYour son,\nCUZZY\n🐵💚🐵💙🐵💖🐵💜🐵💛",

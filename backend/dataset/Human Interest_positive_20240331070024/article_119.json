    "text": "LAKELAND, Fla. â€” Cristian Pache hit a home run to centre field and seven Philadelphia pitchers combined on a four-hit shutout as the Phillies beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-0 in spring training baseball action Thursday.\nPhiladelphia opened the scoring in the fifth when Trea Turner's single off Connor Cooke scored Matt Kroon from second.\nPache made it 2-0 in the sixth with a two-out homer off Hayden Juenger.\nThe Phillies capped the scoring with three in the seventh. Toronto lefty Jimmy Burnette walked in a run after loading the bases. He was replaced by Luis Quinones, who hit William Simoneit with a pitch to drive in another run. A third run scored when Carlos De La Cruz hit into a force out.\nMax Castillo and Kolby Allard split the first four innings for Philadelphia, with Connor Brogdon, Yunior Marte, Nick Snyder, David Parkinson and Taylor Lehman mopping up. Allard picked up the win.\nToronto starter Jose Berrios and Mitch White each pitched two shutout innings. Cooke took over in the fifth and was charged with the loss.\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. led the Jays offence with two hits.\nToronto fell to 2-4 in pre-season play heading into a game Friday evening against the New York Yankees in Tampa.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 29, 2024.\nThe Canadian Press",

Also, a South Philly native, teacher Pat Shanahan, remembers Colasante as \"a stand-out student who absorbed everything.\"\nCBS News Philadelphia Another person who was spotted at the event was Roman Catholic basketball senior guard Kabe Goss. Goss has the winning shot at the buzzer in overtime Monday night against Archbishop Ryan High School, making Roman Catholic win its second consecutive Philadelphia Catholic League championship and the 34th title in the team's history.\nGoss said the shot that will be remembered for years to come still feels surreal.\n\"Any given day, it could have been anybody. It could have been anybody. There's been games Shareef [Jackson] stepped up, a game I had to step up [and], bench players had to step up,\" Goss said. \"Everybody played a role.\"\nGoss hit the shot after an Archbishop Ryan player put them up by one. His teammate, Jackson, said he thought that shot sealed Roman Catholic's fate before Goss hit the ultimate dagger.\n\"You know he had desperation when he made that three up by one, then you see your point guard go down and hit that shot,\" Jackson said. \"It's just relief by the end of that.\"\nGoss and Jackson said it was an incredible feeling and moment.\nDuring his time at Roman Catholic, officials said Colasante received student aid and wanted to give back.\nIn: Philadelphia Taleisha Newbill Taleisha Newbill is a digital content producer at CBS News Philadelphia.

    "text": "Adam Sandler is a man who prioritises comfort — this much can be deduced from his perennial preference for dressing in billowy tees, basketball shorts, and sneakers (he finds suits intolerably \"itchy\") — and this priority has been reflected, more often than not, in his career choices.\nFor decades, he's been plying variations of the man-child, the wacky savant, the weirdo-naïf. His films are always peopled with the real-life pals he forged all the way back in his SNL days and are often set in luxe tropical locales.\nUncut Gems review: Adam Sandler dazzles in high-anxiety thriller The comedian doubles down on his acting credentials in this propulsive, tragicomic odyssey through New York City's gem district, streaming on Netflix.\nRead more\nSince 2014, he's been putting out a steady stream of goofy-sweet comedies for Netflix ; comfort viewing for millions cosied up on the couch at home.\nThere have been notable exceptions: Sandler's performance as compulsive gambler Howard Ratner in Uncut Gems in 2019 was an electrifying left turn on the level of, if not greater than, his first dramatic role, in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love (2002).\nAs lonesome small-fry entrepreneur Barry Egan, Sandler swung between anxious mess and exploding with rage, and proved to the haters — though he didn't owe them anything — that he could do more than funny voices.\nAnother sad man in space The latest Sandler-Netflix venture — directed by Chernobyl's Johan Renck and based on a book by Jaroslav Kalfar, Spaceman of Bohemia (2017) — represents new territory again for the actor. Although, it must be noted, it's territory that has recently been trod by other big names, including Matthew McConaughey (in Interstellar), Ryan Gosling (in First Man ), and Brad Pitt (in Ad Astra ).\nAs Jakub Procházka, a Czech astronaut on a solo mission, Sandler joins the ranks of sad men in space, appearing drained of his characteristic geniality and rage alike. (Nor is he doing an accent — sorry folks, Renck doesn't believe in them.)\nSandler wore a harness suspended from wires to create the effect of zero gravity while his character was in space. ( Supplied: Netflix )\nMillions of miles from any beach resort or sprawling suburban home or, indeed, from any jokes, Sandler accesses a resolutely hushed, contemplative mode — leaning all the way into the depressive midlife slump he brushed up against in 2022 basketball drama Hustle.\n\"I used to be able to write these romantic comedies and comedies about people struggling with what they're going to do with their life,\" Sandler tells ABC Arts. He appears to be in quite a contemplative mood himself on the day we speak, though he's decked out in Miami-hued neons.\n\"Now, at my age, I'm like, 'what is the struggle that will connect with other people?'\"\nSandler also professes a certain suggestibility. \"Every time I watch a movie that I could act in, I say, 'Oh shit, I'd like to do something like that'. I get influenced quickly.\"\nIt's an endearing and perhaps rare quality for a wildly successful man in his fifties to have — suggestive of a curiosity and capacity for excitement that rhymes with the naiveté of his most iconic characters.\n\"Carey is the most exquisite actor I've ever worked with. She's so technically perfect and so delightful as a human being,\" Renck told The Hollywood Reporter. ( Supplied: Netflix )\nJakub's mission in Spaceman is to retrieve a sample of a magenta cloud of space dust, a beautiful but ominous new presence in the sky over Earth. Man and movie alike, however, are far more interested in the mysteries of the human heart than in those of the cosmos.\nWe meet Jakub six months into his journey, at which point his wife, Lenka (Carey Mulligan), has stopped answering his calls, and the pining astronaut is seeking comfort in the forms of liquor and choc-hazelnut spread.\nIt's the unexpected appearance aboard the ship of Hanus, a giant, extraterrestrial arachnid voiced by Paul Dano, that shakes Jakub out of his growing stupor.\nAn unlikely eight-legged friend In a warm monotone, Hanus prods Jakub to consider his relationship with Lenka, from the magic of their first encounter through to its present state of distance and disrepair.\nHanus functions as something like a benevolent, eight-legged Ghost of Christmas Past, nudging Jakub towards the revelation that — at least as far as Lenka is concerned — he's been kind of a Scrooge.\nNecessarily acting against a tennis ball for his scenes with Hanus, Sandler speaks fondly of seeing his unlikely companion come to life for the first time.\nFilm still from Spaceman (2024) featuring Hanus (voice by Paul Dano). ( Supplied: Netflix )\n\"I saw drawings, so I knew what it was possibly going to look like — but getting to see the movie, and how fluid Hanus is movin' around the ship, and how warm his eyes are, and his little teeth that seem like they could eat corn on the cob …\" he says, drifting off, tickled by the mental image.\nWhile Dano recorded Hanus's lines in a darkened room, Sandler's role was a little more physically demanding — again taking the actor out of his comfort zone.\n\"When I read the script and saw this movie in my head, I was so excited,\" he says.\n\"Two weeks before we started shooting, Johan told me, 'Of course, you know this isn't Star Trek — you're not walking around on the ship. There's no gravity.'\n\"So then I realised that I had to do all these beautiful scenes while floating and having people twist me around.\n\"The wires and the harness and all that — my body is not meant for that. My body is not meant for a lot of things. But I did it.\"\nDespite these new and trying conditions, Sandler gives a performance that is remarkable in its restraint — all the more so for the way in which it contrasts his public persona.\nIn Spaceman, the waggish comedian and devoted family man is left without any old friends or loved ones to bounce off or perform for.\nIsabella Rossellini appears in Spaceman as Commissioner Tuma, Jakub's commanding officer. ( Supplied: Netflix )\nA little bit of that energy, however, would have leavened Spaceman — just a bit of the Adam Sandler seen in, say, Mr Deeds (2002); breaking out into a rendition of Space Oddity while on a private jet, singing into a banana, charming the pilots. But, as Bowie sang (more or less), the star looks very different today.\n\"The inner peace is here now — I'm calmer,\" Sandler says.\n\"There's less screaming in my house.\"\nSpaceman is streaming on Netflix from March 1.\nLoading YouTube content Posted 29 Feb 2024 29 Feb 2024 Thu 29 Feb 2024 at 10:16pm\nRelated Stories This lesbian road movie from Ethan Coen embraces debauchery and sex positivity — and it's hilarious Nicolas Cage is suddenly popping up in people's dreams in the latest film from A24 'Remarkably tender': Why Adam Sandler as Leo the lizard is more emotional than expected",

    "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. – The Hollywood Police Department was conducting training with its divers when they were suddenly called into action. “Someone alerted them that there may be a manatee that has something stuck to it,” said Hollywood police spokesperson Deanna Bettineschi. It happened Tuesday in North Lake, which is located in east Hollywood. “There was a manatee that had a crab trap buoy attached to its flipper,” said Bettineschi. “One of the officers saw it and jumped in the water.” That officer dove under the water and cut the trap off the manatee. “You never know what this manatee was going through with its device attached to its tail,” said Bettineschi. “They’re used to freely swimming.” It was unexpected rescue mission successfully carried out by some of Hollywood’s finest. “A proud moment, right place, right time,” said Bettineschi.

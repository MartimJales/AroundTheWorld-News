    "text": "Wynnton Boots and Shoe Repair serves Columbus community for 75 years COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Wynnton Boot and Shoe Repair has a long history in Columbus dating back three decades. The hum of specialized vintage equipment fills the workroom at Wynnton Boot and Shoe Repair in Midtown Columbus. Johnny Davis and his wife Karbina Davis have worked together in harmony for over 30 years at the shop’s current location. “It was Mr. Lee Brady that taught me how to fix shoes, J.E. Hagler started it, I worked for him for about 30 years before I bought it.” said Davis Wynnton Boot & Shoe Repair was first owned by J.E. Hagler. It was first located in the Midtown area in a shopping center where the old Rite Aide building now stands. Hagler handed down the shop to his two sons then it was later purchased by Johnny Davis in 1995. The shop is now located at the corner of Wynnton Rd. and Peacock Ave. “We do everything from putting on heels to re-soling shoes to fixing purses, sewing patches, anything that can be done with leather, we pretty much do it.” said Davis. “You can see the difference when the shoes come in- they looking old and rough and when they leave out they looking new.” said Karbina. From re-soling, stitching, adding taps to high-heeled shoes, shaping, and shinning, Cobbler and Karbina have repaired shoes for customers far and near. “Man, I done had customers ship me shoes from overseas. G-I’s, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, Florida that used to live here, moved, but they still send me their shoes.” said Cobbler Many customers expressed their love and support for Wynnton Boot and Shoe Repair. “It’s the best place in town to get your shoes fixed. They do it quick and very inexpensively.” said longtime customer, Shawn Flowers “I’ve been coming for years. They are reliable, dependable, do excellent work at a reasonable price.” said longtime customer, Phyllis Jones Davis says if his customers are happy, he’s happy. Copyright 2024 WTVM.

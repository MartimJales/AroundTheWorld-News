Dyck, 20, went 9-0-1-0 with a 1.81 goals-against average, .931 save percentage and one shutout through 10 appearances during the month of February, helping the Broncos push their way up the WHL’s Eastern Conference standings. A product of Winkler, Man., Dyck was named WHL Goaltender of the Week on two occasions during the month of February, first for the week ending Sunday, February 4 and second for the week ending Sunday, February 25. Dyck leads the Broncos in all major goaltending categories this season, including appearances (28), GAA (2.59), save percentage (.915) and shutouts (2). With a record of 19-6-2-0, the 6-foot-5, 193-pound puckstopper is on the verge of reaching the 20-win plateau for the first time in his career. Dating back to Tuesday, February 6, Dyck has won eight consecutive games. Over that eight-game stretch, Dyck has held his opponents to two goals or less on seven occasions. He hasn’t lost in regulation since dropping a 5-3 decision to the Moose Jaw Warriors in which he allowed four goals. Dyck’s month began with a 26-save shutout of the Regina Pats, as he backstopped the Broncos to a 3-0 victory on Friday, February 2. On Tuesday, February 6, the Manitoba product recorded his largest save count of the month, turning aside 33 shots in a 4-3 win versus Red Deer. Selected by the Broncos in the third round (45th overall) of the 2019 WHL Draft, Dyck owns a career record of 43-45-5-1 in 99 regular season appearances. He was chosen by the Boston Bruins in the sixth round (183rd overall) of the 2022 NHL Draft.

    "text": "[Zac Bellman](/staff/5378002001/zac-bellman/) Waterford wrestler Hayden Halter had his 2019 WIAA state individual wrestling title reinstated by a Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruling Wednesday, the latest turn in a multi-year legal battle. The Court of Appeals stated that the WIAA \"applied its eligibility and appeals rules with respect to Halter in a manner that was arbitrary and in accordance with its will and not its judgment\" in a ruling in favor of Halter. Here are the developments of the case, which began with two penalties assessed five years ago: Halter initially suspended for two unsportsmanlike penalties In the Southern Lakes Conference tournament on Feb. 2, 2019, Halter received two unsportsmanlike penalties – the validity of which has been the subject of significant scrutiny – in a victory by decision. The first was levied on the sophomore for questioning an official's call. The latter came for flexing his muscles and shouting at an opposing crowd from Burlington, where Halter was enrolled and wrestled as a freshman. Journal Sentinel reporting at the time stated that the official involved, Michael Arendt, claimed Halter responded to a call at the end of the match with profanity before making the flexing gesture to the crowd. WIAA rules mandated a one-match suspension for Halter for the assessed infractions, which would have made him ineligible for the regional tournament that followed and ended his season. Halter won initial injuction to allow him to compete in 2019 The Halter family retained a lawyer and took the case to the Racine County Circuit Court, where a judge ruled on Feb. 8, 2019, that Halter's actions did not merit the two unsportsmanlike penalties. A restraining order was issued to block the suspension, allowing Halter to continue to compete in the WIAA postseason. Halter went on to win the WIAA Division 1 state individual title at 120 pounds, his second-consecutive title after winning at 106 pounds as a freshman at Burlington. The crowd at the Kohl Center for the 2019 state tournament was apparently well aware of the controversy around Halter's eligibility as he ascended to the title, as a [chorus of boo's rang down](/story/sports/high-schools/2019/02/22/wiaa-state-wrestling-hayden-halter-booed-kohl-center-crowd/2959009002/) on his final wins to secure the title. Circuit Court appeal ruling strips state title The WIAA appealed the Circuit Court ruling, and after a May 2021 evidentiary hearing, received a ruling in its favor. Motions made on behalf of the Halters for certiorari (appeal to a higher court), a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction were denied according to court documents. The Circuit Court ruled that the WIAA's interpretation of its rules initially was \"in accord with a long-standing policy of the WIAA\" and \"did not violate Halter’s procedural or substantive due process rights.\" The judgement stripped Halter of his 2019 individual state title, as well as all matches, places, points and scores from the regional tournament through the end of the season. The Halters appealed the decision, leading to Wednesday's ruling. Wednesday's ruling reinstates 2019 title The Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Wednesday included a declaration that Halter's registration and sitting out of a Badger Invitational junior varsity/varsity reserve meet held on Feb. 5, 2019, between the Feb. 2 conference meet and the Feb. 9 regional meet, satisfied the serving of his suspension. Furthermore, the court stated that Halter was thus eligible to compete and receive all titles, wins and points awarded to him and his team, including related records and benefits. \"This court further concludes that Halter is entitled to a permanent injunction reinstating his 2019 WIAA Division I state wrestling title, as well as all wins and points (to him and to his team) and all accompanying records and benefits therefrom,\" the ruling stated. In a statement Thursday, the WIAA did not rule out the possibility of an appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. \"The WIAA is reviewing the Court of Appeals’ decision with its legal counsel and considering the next steps in the process,\" the statement read. As of Thursday afternoon, the WIAA accounting of all-time individual state title winners lists the 2019 Division 1 120-pound title as \"Vacated by ineligible wrestler.\" Halter, meanwhile, describes himself as a \"2x D1 Wisconsin State Champion\" on his Instagram profile .",

    "text": "Amidst the echoes of a rich basketball legacy and excited cheers, Gov. Jim Justice and First Lady Cathy Justice, accompanied by their recovering dog, Babydog, presented a significant $15,711,654 check from the West Virginia School Building Authority at Mullens Middle School. This grant, earmarked for the construction of a new Mullens Elementary and Middle School, symbolizes a substantial investment in the future of education in Wyoming County. Set to consolidate two historic schools, this development promises a state-of-the-art learning environment for pre-kindergarten through eighth-grade students by fall 2026.\nHistoric Consolidation and Community Impact\nThe grant represents a pivotal moment for Mullens, combining $8,753,193 from a $20.1 million facilities bond sale with state funds to create a new educational landmark. The new Mullens Elementary and Middle School, costing a total of $24,464,847, will replace buildings dating back to 1951 and 1923, respectively. Located on the site of the Mullens athletic field, the project not only preserves but revitalizes a piece of the community's heart, embedding educational progress within a cherished historical context.\nCommemorating a Rich Legacy\nGov. Justice, reminiscing about his own experiences in Mullens' gym and the formidable legacy of local basketball heroes like the D'Antoni brothers and Jerome Anderson, emphasized the importance of remembering and building upon the community's achievements. The school's gym, adorned with banners of seven state basketball championships, stands as a testament to the town's enduring spirit and excellence. This project, therefore, is seen not just as the construction of a building, but as a continuation of Mullens' proud tradition of achievement and community strength.\nLooking Toward the Future\nThe anticipation for the new school is palpable among students, educators, and community members. With groundbreaking ceremonies tentatively scheduled for April 12, the project promises not only a modern educational facility but also a source of community pride and rejuvenation. Superintendent Deirdre Cline and incoming superintendent John Henry expressed their commitment to creating a school where students can build great memories, emphasizing the importance of pride in one's roots and the boundless potential of the students of Mullens.\nAs the community looks forward to the opening of the new school in the fall of 2026, the project stands as a beacon of hope and progress. It represents not only a significant investment in the educational future of Wyoming County's children but also a profound commitment to preserving and celebrating the rich history and enduring spirit of the Mullens community.",

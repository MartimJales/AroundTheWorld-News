    "text": "In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it’s easy to lose sight of what truly matters. As we navigate through the complexities and challenges, the concept of putting God first emerges as a beacon of guidance and peace. But what are the steps to putting God first, and how can it transform our lives?\nWhat Does Putting God First Look Like?\nPutting God first means that in every aspect of our lives—be it decisions, relationships, or priorities—God’s presence and principles guide our actions and choices. It’s about aligning our will with God’s, seeking his kingdom before\nour own ambitions or desires. This fundamental shift in perspective leads to a life filled with purpose, peace, and contentment.\nTo truly prioritize God, integrate spiritual practices into your daily life. Begin your day with prayer, seeking God’s guidance and expressing gratitude. Make Scripture reading a non-negotiable part of your routine, allowing God’s Word to shape your day. In decision-making, ask yourself what aligns with God’s will, and seek counsel from the Holy Spirit.\nRELATED:\nThe Goal of Spiritual Practices Psalm 1:2 and 1 Thessalonians 2:4 provide insight into prioritizing God, highlighting the importance of delighting in His Word and seeking to please God above all.\nPutting God first in a relationship means building it on the foundation of God’s love and principles. Communicate openly about faith, support each other’s spiritual growth, and center your relationship around God’s purpose.\n5 Ways to Put God First\n- Love God Wholeheartedly: Jesus states that the greatest commandment is to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind (\nMatthew 22:37). This means devoting every aspect of our lives to God’s service and glory.\n- Pray Continuously:\n1 Thessalonians 5:17encourages us to “pray without ceasing.” Regular communication with God through prayer strengthens our relationship with Him and acknowledges His sovereignty in our lives.\n- Meditate on His Word: Regularly reading and reflecting on Scripture allows God’s Word to guide our thoughts, actions, and decisions.\n- Trust in His Plan:\nProverbs 3:5-6advises us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and not rely on our understanding, acknowledging Him in all our ways.\n- Prioritize God in Your Life: This involves rearranging our daily routines and commitments to ensure that time with God is not just another item on our to-do list but a central focus.",

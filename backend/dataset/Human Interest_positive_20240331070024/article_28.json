    "text": "ONE IN A MILLION: Woman celebrates birthday by winning $1M scratch-off PALOS HEIGHTS, Ill. (Gray News) - Never in a million years did an Illinois woman think she would win an instant $1 million by playing a scratch-off. An unidentified woman celebrated her birthday by winning a seven-figure lottery ticket. The ticket was purchased at a BP gas station at 12700 South Harlem Ave. in Palos Heights, [according to WLS.](https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-lottery-palos-heights-gas-station-winning-ticket-scratch-off/14479204/) [WLS reported](https://abc7chicago.com/illinois-lottery-palos-heights-gas-station-winning-ticket-scratch-off/14479204/) that the woman decided to stop at a gas station and buy a $25 Diamond Crossword 10X purple ticket. She said she selected that specific ticket because it was her favorite color. “When I scratched the ticket in my car, I kept seeing wins that were getting bigger and bigger,” she said, per the reports. “As I got to the end, I realized it was worth $1 million and I couldn’t believe it.” The woman was so shocked she went back in to double-check. “I instantly started crying and my legs felt like noodles. I didn’t think I would be able to drive home,” she said. The woman told lottery officials that the money will make a difference in her life. She said she and her husband work very hard and she wants to give her children opportunities that the world has to offer. The store will receive $10,000 for selling the winning ticket.

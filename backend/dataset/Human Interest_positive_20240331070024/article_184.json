    "text": "Woman missing since 2017 reunites with family after Michigan State Police rescue Jenna Prestininzi Detroit Free Press A woman missing since 2017 is back with her family following a tip to Michigan State Police.\nThe recovery effort began with a woman calling state police Monday to report that her stepdaughter, missing since 2017, had contacted her and was being held against her will in an Inkster motel.\nPolice began investigating and found that the victim was being held at Evergreen Motel in Inkster. Detectives and Metro South Post troopers then went to the motel, where they heard a girl screaming and crying in a motel room, made forcible entry, and recovered the victim.\n\"Great work by TAG detectives following this tip and rescuing this woman and getting her back with her family,\" said Lt. Mike Shaw.\nDuring the operation, police identified a suspect, conducted a search warrant, and seized drugs, cell phones, and a firearm.\nAuthorities took the victim to Beaumont Dearborn Hospital for a medical evaluation and interview by detectives. The victim then reunited with her family and officials provided her with recovery resources.\nPolice have not identified the victim by name or age.\nAn investigation into the matter remains ongoing to determine whether human trafficking was involved.",

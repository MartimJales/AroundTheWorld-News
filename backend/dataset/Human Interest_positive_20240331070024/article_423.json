    "text": "In the '90s I was a founding member of the Black History Club in high school, took Black history courses in college and worked in the minority affairs office in grad school. Yet I did not know who Bayard Rustin was until seeing the 2003 documentary \"Brother Outsider.\"\nThat miseducation was not by accident.\nLZ Granderson\nRustin — the man who introduced the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the principles of nonviolence, the man who organized the March on Washington — was gay. Because of his sexual orientation, his contributions to the civil rights movement were not often retold. Since the documentary's release 20 years ago, there has been a concerted effort to change that, most recently culminating in the 2023 film \"Rustin\" and the performance of awards season darling Colman Domingo in the title role.\nA decade ago, Domingo brought Ralph Abernathy to life in Ava DuVernay's \"Selma,\" which also included Rustin. Today he is the first Afro-Latino to be nominated for a lead actor Oscar. He is the second out gay man to be nominated for portraying an out gay man.",

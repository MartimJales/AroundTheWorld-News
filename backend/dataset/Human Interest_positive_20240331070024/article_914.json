    "text": "The family of the late Geelong Football Club president Frank Costa has made an unprecedented $10 million pledge to the club, marking a significant contribution to its future and honoring Costa's lasting legacy. This generous donation, confirmed by Costa's widow Shirley at a recent club function, is set to propel the development of a new indoor training facility, a testament to Costa's lifelong devotion to the Cats and the broader Geelong community.\nMonumental Legacy and Transformation\nFrank Costa’s tenure as president beginning in 1999 was a turning point for the Geelong Football Club. At a time when the club faced financial difficulties and on-field struggles, Costa, alongside CEO Brian Cook, spearheaded a dramatic turnaround. Their leadership not only rescued the club from financial despair but also laid the foundations for a golden era, culminating in premiership victories in 2007 and 2009, and once again in 2011. Costa's vision and dedication transformed the club into one of the AFL's most formidable forces, breaking a premiership drought that had lingered since 1963 and reinvigorating the spirit of the Geelong community.\nTributes and Honors\nFrank Costa’s impact extended beyond the football field. His passing in May 2021, after a prolonged illness, was met with an outpouring of tributes from across Victoria and the football community. Recognized for his contributions to both the club and the town of Geelong, Costa was honored with a state memorial service held at Kardinia Park, attended by thousands. In 2023, the city further commemorated his legacy by unveiling a statue in the city center, capturing Costa in his early days as a local paper boy. This gesture symbolized Costa's humble beginnings and his profound influence on the Geelong community.\nA Bright Future Ahead\nWith the announcement of the Costa family's $10 million donation, the Geelong Football Club embarks on a new chapter, one that promises to build on Frank Costa’s remarkable legacy. The planned indoor training facility is just one aspect of the club’s future development plans, aimed at enhancing the team’s training capabilities and securing its competitive edge. As the Cats prepare to unveil their new Selwood Stand at GMHBA stadium in the opening round against St Kilda, increasing the venue's capacity to over 40,000, the spirit of Frank Costa’s dedication and passion for the club lives on, driving Geelong towards a future filled with promise and success.",

    "text": "A Fertile Plot of Land at Franklin First United Methodist Church Is Nurturing Its Neighbors\nIn 2007, Franklin First United Methodist Church purchased 107 acres on which to build their new church campus. But before the bricks were in place, a pumpkin seed was planted. Those pumpkins brought joy to our children but it seemed God had a bigger plan – to grow a garden. The Giving Garden was then born.\nThe garden, on a 7-acre portion of the church's land, produces around 20,000 pounds of produce annually, which is then given to nonprofits in the area. The weekly distribution of this produce has enabled Franklin First to learn about their partners and build relationships beyond produce. These relationships include the Franklin Farmers Market, where volunteers gather unsold produce and redistribute it to homes facing food insecurity. They distribute food to\nThe Healing House, a residential center for women in treatment, where a former resident serves on the board. Volunteers cut hundreds of flowers from the flower and herb garden for arrangements donated to Meal on Wheels.\nOn Wednesday nights in the summer, the garden hosts an old fashioned potluck where non-gardeners join in the fellowship and might just stay around for a pea shelling good time.\nThe Giving Garden is solely dependent on the generosity of volunteers from the church and community. Many participants in the Master Gardener program dedicate hours in the garden, as well as high school students needing to fulfill community service hours, youth groups on summer mission, and business organizations wishing to serve the community.\nThe Giving Garden has evolved and grown since that first pumpkin seed, but it has always been and remains to be ‘a garden about people’ in relationship with each other and our community.\nLearn more at\nfranklinfumc.org or contact the church office at 615.794.2734",

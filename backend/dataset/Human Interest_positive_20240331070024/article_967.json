Goshay](/staff/5793975002/charita-m-goshay/) CANTON â€’ You could call Melissa Aquino a young mom. This year, her son, Jakob Goudy, turns 12. So does she today, at least technically. That's because Aquino is a \"leap year baby.\" \"It was kind of cool growing up,\" said Aquino, a Canton resident. Aquino was born on Feb. 29, 1976. That extra day in February occurs only once every four years. Her son turns 12 on March 27. She will be 48 this week. \"He's going to be 12 for a year, and I get to be 12 for four years,\" she said with a smile. How does a leap year happen? What is a leap year: [Breaking down the science, and history, behind the ancient phenomenon](/story/news/2024/01/06/what-is-a-leap-year/72108115007/) According to the History Channel, leap years were first calculated by the Egyptians in the third century, B.C. The earth makes a complete orbit around the sun every 365.2422 days. Those 0.2422 hours add up to create another day to the calendar every four years. Being a leap year baby is a rarity. Unlike the 1-in-365 chance of being born on a certain date, a baby has a 1-in-1461 chance of being born on Feb. 29. Approximately 5 million people have Feb. 29 birthdays. What's it like to have a leap year birthday? Aquino said that growing up, she'd either celebrate with her maternal grandfather, whose birthday was Feb. 28, or with her childhood best friend, whose birthday was March 1. \"People don't really give me a choice with that,\" she said. \"I just say 'thank you' two days in a row.\" When she was 4, Aquino was featured in the Canton Repository in \"recognition her \"first\" birthday. \"I just remember that people made big fuss about it,\" she said. Aquino said the family will likely have a get-together to celebrate their birthdays.

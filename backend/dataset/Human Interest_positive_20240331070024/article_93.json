Wall is up to three home runs this spring.\nDavid Fletcher stole home for the Braves and went 3-for-4 with a double, an RBI single and two runs. Marcell Ozuna added a solo shot and starter Dylan Dodd (1-0) tossed two spotless innings with two strikeouts.\nTampa Bay trailed 12-2 entering the bottom of the sixth but scored the final seven runs of the game before running out of time.

Their heroics made a winner out of reliever Tucker Davidson (1-0), who struck out two while giving up a run on two hits over two innings.\nHenry Davis, the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Pirates in 2021, hit a three-run homer off Orioles starter Corbin Burnes in the top of the first. Connor Sadzeck (0-1) blew the save.\nRed Sox 5, Tigers 2\nRafael Devers hit a solo home run and finished 2-for-3 with two runs as Boston defeated visiting Detroit in Fort Myers, Fla.\nTrevor Story added RBIs on a double and a bases-loaded walk, while starter Garrett Whitlock (1-0) fanned six batters over three innings, yielding a run on three hits.\nRyan Kreidler and Trei Cruz drove in the Tigers’ runs.

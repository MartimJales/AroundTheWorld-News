    "text": "On a bright and promising Friday, March 8, the Girls Academic Leadership Academy (GALA)-Dr. Michelle King School for STEM will open its doors to host the 7th annual Young Women's Career Conference (YWCC), a pivotal event dedicated to connecting GALA students with trailblazing women across diverse fields. Renowned multidisciplinary artist and entrepreneur Justina Blakeney will illuminate the event as the keynote speaker, sharing her journey and insights into creative and STEM disciplines.\nInspiring a New Generation\nThe YWCC was conceived to offer GALA students, ranging from 6th to 12th grade, a rare opportunity to engage directly with women leaders thriving in professions often underrepresented by females, including aerospace, gaming, engineering, and more. Throughout the day, attendees will immerse themselves in speaker panels and workshops tailored to foster skills in financial literacy, social media branding, and self-empowerment, among others. Elizabeth Cohen, YWCC chair, emphasizes the event's role in nurturing self-discovery and setting ambitious goals among students.\nAddressing the Gender Gap\nDespite women constituting 28% of the STEM workforce, disparities remain, particularly in fields such as computer science and engineering. GALA, as California's sole all-girl, STEM-focused public school, is at the forefront of challenging these statistics by preparing its students for college and beyond. GALA teacher Rose Agamegwa and founder Dr. Elizabeth Hicks highlight the importance of exposing students to successful women in STEM, noting the positive impact on their aspirations and confidence.\nBuilding a Supportive Network\nThe YWCC not only serves as an educational platform but also as a crucial networking opportunity for GALA students. By meeting and learning from accomplished women leaders, students expand their mentoring support network, gaining invaluable insights and inspiration. This year's conference promises to be an enriching experience, furthering GALA's mission to empower young women to achieve their full potential and close the gender gap in STEM fields.\nFor more information about the event and how to participate, interested parties can visit fogala.org/ywcc. As the GALA community and its supporters converge for this annual event, the message is clear: the future of STEM is inclusive, and it begins with empowering the next generation of women leaders.",

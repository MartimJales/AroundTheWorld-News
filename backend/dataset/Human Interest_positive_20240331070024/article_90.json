    "text": "By Sarah Reinsel\nWant to help thousands of LCMS youth and adults have a safe and enjoyable time at the 2025 LCMS Youth Gathering? Applications to serve as a Gathering Ambassador are due March 15.\nIn this essential role, volunteers serve as a trusted guide for all Gathering participants. Gathering Ambassadors are on the ground everywhere during the week to answer questions, help participants navigate events and activities, and ensure everyone is safe and able to make the most of the experience.\nMost importantly, “volunteers are making an opportunity for youth to grow in their faith,” said DCE Melissa Luepke, who manages Gathering Ambassadors.\n“We’re looking for servant leaders who want to make a difference for Jesus. This is a great way to be a part of the Gathering and to serve the church at large.”\nHighly visible in their yellow T-shirts, Gathering Ambassadors are stationed wherever official Gathering events are happening — in hotels, at the convention center, working the interactive floor and helping direct traffic at stadium events.\nGathering Ambassadors are LCMS church workers or laypeople. Any adult age 26 or older is invited to apply.\nGathering Ambassadors come to the Gathering for training a few days before it begins and then serve for the duration of the week. Once their application is accepted, Gathering Ambassadors pay a volunteer registration fee of $400, which goes toward travel, hotels and meals.\nAn event as big as the Gathering would not be possible without the help of the small army of volunteers who give of their time and talent to be servant leaders for a week.\nLuepke, who went to her first Gathering as a youth in 1992, has attended 11 more Gatherings since then. She emphasized how formative this week is for youth as they spend time in God’s Word and grow in their faith.\n“There is such power in seeing the Body of Christ come together in such a big way,” said Luepke.\nTo apply to be a Gathering Ambassador, visit\nlcmsgathering.com/volunteer.\nPosted Feb. 29, 2024",

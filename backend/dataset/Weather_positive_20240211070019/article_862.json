    "text": "WISCONSIN -- (WAOW) During most winters, snowmobiles cruising through the countryside are a common site. But with now major snowfall until recently, the trails have been bare. Now that some has fallen, area snowmobile clubs say it's a step in the right direction. Allan Zahrt, the vice president of the [Trailmates Snowmobile Club](https://www.trailmatesclub.com/), said, \"We needed cold weather first, to freeze up the streams and rivers and lakes and get the ground frozen properly. So, now we're starting to get the snow on top. We do need a little bit more snow here in Marathon County.\" In the Northwoods, the folks at [American Pond Hockey](https://www.americanpondhockey.com/) are preparing for their annual tournament in a couple of weeks. They said that they're pleased with what Mother Nature has given so far. Will Jeffery, the founder of American Pond Hockey, said, \"What we are focused on, and paying the most attention to, is the timing of the wild lake ice, and when that forms, and when the first heavyweight snow comes after that.\" Jeffery said that this week's single-digit temperatures will make sure that there's plenty of ice to play on come February. Further to the south, where there was more snowfall, some snowmobile clubs are already taking advantage. Several trails across Wood County are opening back up.",

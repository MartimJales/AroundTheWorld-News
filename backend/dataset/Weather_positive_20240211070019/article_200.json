    "text": "First Alert Weather: Preventing frozen pipes by using your faucet SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - A challenge that comes with cold weather is the potential for frozen pipes. Plumbers say when it gets this cold, it’s a good idea to run your faucets at a slow trickle to prevent things from freezing up. It can also help to open up the cabinets under your kitchen and bathroom sinks to expose them to warmer air. Milz Markley with Delong Plumbing Heating & Air says we’re about to enter a stretch when frozen pipes will likely become a major concern. “Whenever we start dropping down to these single digits, and we have a lot of wind, we’ll see a lot more pipes freeze up than we normally do. Such as last year, we had heavy wind. A lot of houses froze that hadn’t froze in over 40 years,” says Markley. Another suggestion from the pros is to make sure exterior vents and crawl space openings are closed up to keep that cold air from working its way into your house.

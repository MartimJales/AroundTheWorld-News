    "text": "Windy, wild weather has taken much of the country by storm this week. And while it’s fun to think about a short golf getaway to somewhere in warmer climes, what about permanently relocating to a place you can enjoy year-round?\nSuch is the case on the tiny island of Mauritius, a tiny island off the African coast that’s home to about 1.2 million residents and some of the most beautiful views on the planet.\nThis villa boasts sea, golf and mountain views, all alongside the Ernie Els-designed Anahita Golf Club. When you’re done with 18, it’s easy to dip in the 25-meter pool that could entertain quite the crew of golf buddies.\nFrom the listing at Sotheby’s:\nLocated next to the stunning swimming pool, the large open plan kitchen and living space are the heart of this exquisite villa. Each of the rooms has been individually decorated and feature bespoke, locally made furniture throughout.\nWith beautifully designed spaces inside and out, Villa Extraordinaire is the perfect space to bring the whole family together.\nForeign ownership: access to Mauritian residence permit and a favourable fiscal climate.\nAnd of course, there’s the weather. With temperatures in the summer hovering in the 80s and in the winter still jumping consistently into the 70s, this could be the perfect place if you’ve had enough shoveling.\nHere are some stunning images of the property:\n$8.7 million villa on Anahita Golf Club This villa on the Ernie Els-designed Anahita Golf Club in Mauritius is selling for $8.7 million.… This villa on the Ernie Els-designed Anahita Golf Club in Mauritius is selling for $8.7 million.

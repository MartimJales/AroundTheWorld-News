    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - The First Warn 5 Weather team continued its 3 Degree Guarantee program for the month of November, keeping their forecast as accurate as possible.\nOn Thursday, local nonprofit Warriors’ Ascent received a $950 check as part of our 3 Degree Guarantee .\nWarriors’ Ascent is an organization that aims to provide hope and healing to veterans and first responders suffering from post-traumatic stress.\nEach weekday during the 10 p.m. newscast the First Warn 5 Weather Team will deliver a guaranteed forecast that includes the high temperature for Kansas City for the following day. Then each day on KCTV5 News at 6 p.m. they will compare the forecast high temperature to the actual high temperature reported at KCI.\nEvery time the forecast high temperature is within 3 degrees of the actual high, KCTV5 will donate $50 to a local charity. At the end of each month, KCTV5 will add up the total and present a check to the selected charity.\nThe First Warn 5 Weather team prides itself on accuracy and is excited to be helping those in Kansas City and surrounding areas. That way when we get it right, everyone wins!\nCongrats to Warriors’ Ascent on being our most recent recipient, receiving $900 for our forecast predictions in the month of November!\nALSO READ: KCMO nonprofit helping at-risk teens thrive in smaller alternative school Copyright 2024 KCTV.

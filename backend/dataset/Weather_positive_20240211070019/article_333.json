    "text": "WAUSAU, Wis. (WAOW) -- As much as this round of snow may be a hindrance on driving, it's not dulling spirits in Marathon County. Many people utilized their snow day to go downhill at Granite Peak in Rib Mountain or Sylvan Tubing Hill in Wausau. \"Well, school got canceled, and what better to do in Wisconsin when it's snowing like this?\" said Braxton Meyer of Colby, who visited Granite Peak. \"We were like, 'If there's ever a snow day for school, we're going to go out and ride,'\" said Logan Loeffel, also from Colby. Granite Peak had already been going strong for several weeks, due to their snow-making efforts long before this current wave of fresh powder. \"Any snow that we're going to make is not anything compared to what Mother Nature makes. It's still quality snow, but anything that falls from the sky, really, from the clouds that she creates is a lot better,\" said Greg Fisher, Granite Peak's general manager. Sylvan Tubing Hill had recently undergone a multiple-week closure due to poor snow-making conditions, and has now re-opened because of recent snowfall and lower temperatures. Between the two, neither will need a lot more snow, but consistent weather conditions. \"We don't need feet and feet of snow, a couple inches here, a couple inches there goes a long way for the conditions on top of the snow surface that we're grooming,\" Fisher said. With more snow comes more chances to get downhill, and that's music to several peoples' ears. \"All throughout the summer you just talk about going to Granite (Peak) during winter with all the homies, and just getting together for a night ski into the lights. It's just unbelievable,\" Loeffel said. Fisher says Granite Peak plans to be fully open and done with its snow-making within the next few weeks. Sylvan Hill plans to be open weekends through March.

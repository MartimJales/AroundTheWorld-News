    "text": "True Vine Missionary Baptist Church opens to the public as a warming center TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - A local Topeka church is turning their church building into a warming center to help community members get through this cold snap. [True Vine Missionary Baptist church](https://www.facebook.com/TrueVineMB/) opened their doors a little after 6:00 p.m. Jan 14. Church officials tell us that they unfortunately lost power around 6:00 p.m. but crews were able to restore power before 10:30 Sunday night. t.That still didn’t stop them from handing out meals, coats and gloves to those in need. “It was Gods movement, it was one of the ones I couldn’t do it with out him. If He wouldn’t have put it on my heart and my mind, He put it on there so strong that I had to obey,” said True Vine Missionary Baptist Church Pastor Lashad Buffett. “It’s just one of those thing that we have to open. If church is here to help people and were not really helping people, then what are we really doing? So I do and follow as the Lord leads me and He calls us to help people.” The church says they hope to keep warming center open for 2 to 3 days. Get updates on their openings on the church True Vine Missionary Baptist church is located at 307 SE Tefft St, Topeka, KS 66607. Copyright 2024 WIBW. All rights reserved.",

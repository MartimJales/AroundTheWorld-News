    "text": "On December 18, an El Nino fueled super storm sent the biggest south swell in recent memory to New Jersey. Photos of surfers free-falling on 10-foot chocolate bombs in head-to-toe rubber garnered mainstream attention from sites like CBS .\nAs it turns out, that swell was only the beginning.\nAn an overly active storm pattern is sending gulf storms north: In the last week, back-to-back south swells hammered the Jersey shore, and while not as massive as the December swell, they were warmer (a relative term in NJ in the winter), shorter period, and way more makeable.\nIn the clip above, from Ben Currie, you'll see exactly what a certain stretch of sand in NJ looked like, from sun up to sundown.\nAs always, the wind, current and cold made for a difficult day, with many of the best waves going unridden. Still, the brave bunch that gave it a go in 46 degree water were rewarded with some wild slabs and huge spits. Although, the surfer that decides to pass on the wave at 3:18 is certainly kicking himself right now. Had he tuned and gone, he would have chipped into one of the most cartoon-perfect tubes of the day.\nOf course, that's easy to say from behind a screen in the comfort of a warm house. Anyone that even paddled out deserves all the credit in the world. This bunch are as hard core as they come.\n***\nDon't miss another headline from SURFER!

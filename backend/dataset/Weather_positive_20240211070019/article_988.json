    "text": "Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love helped fan stranded in blizzard before Packers win This might be the most Wisconsin story of all time: A Green Bay Packers fan goes to a hair appointment in the middle of a blizzard. Her car gets hopelessly stuck in a snow drift, and then none other than the Packers‚Äô QB pulls up and offers his help. The best part? It‚Äôs all true: Lucy Kurowski braved Blizzard Bennett on Friday as she headed to her hair salon in De Pere, Wisconsin. The roads were treacherous, but she made it there safely. However, on her way home, she wasn‚Äôt so lucky. As she left the salon, [her car](https://www.dontwasteyourmoney.com/7-items-teen-drivers-need-for-their-cars/) got stuck in a snowdrift, leaving her unable to accelerate forward or reverse. But luckily a superhero of the green and gold variety arrived to offer his strength.

Motorists were stranded on roadways across the state, but only 20-year-old Kurowski was lucky enough to get assistance from the Packers‚Äô starting quarterback Jordan Love. The story quickly went viral after Kurowski‚Äôs aunt tweeted about her niece‚Äôs brush with the football star: Omg Jordan Love helping my niece out of a snow drift‚Ä¶what can‚Äôt he do? That‚Äôs my qb üíö [pic.twitter.com/qv0p3Q5Jiz] ‚Äî allie adames (@AllieKurowski) [January 12, 2024] Kurowski explained the situation to her local Fox 11 station, saying: ‚ÄúHe gets out of his car and he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòAre you OK?'‚Äù Kurowski told Fox 11. ‚ÄúAnd I was like, ‚ÄòAre you Jordan Love?!‚Äô I was fangirling. I couldn‚Äôt even believe it.‚Äù Watch WLUK-TV Fox 11‚Äôs Michelle Melby interview Kurowski about the experience on YouTube below: Although Love tried his best, they both quickly realized that one man wouldn‚Äôt be able to budge the car out of the snow, despite being a top-tier athlete on a legendary football team. And, most importantly, Kurowski didn‚Äôt want her team‚Äôs QB risking an injury before his game on Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys.

So she thanked him for his help, snapped a pic and sent Love on his way. Her caution proved worthwhile, as the Packers went on to destroy the Cowboys in a wildcard victory that has been [described](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-latest-playoff-failure-pours-fuel-on-a-potential-dallas-pursuit-of-bill-belichick/) as ‚Äúarguably [the Cowboys‚Äô] most embarrassing playoff loss in recent memory.‚Äù Perhaps Love‚Äôs team can thank him, not only for his prowess on the field but also for racking up good karma off the field as well. And let‚Äôs not forget Wisconsin‚Äôs real MVP: Kurowksi‚Äôs hair stylist, out here styling hair even in the middle of a blizzard and making sure that Cheeseheads are ready to say cheese in all kinds of weather.

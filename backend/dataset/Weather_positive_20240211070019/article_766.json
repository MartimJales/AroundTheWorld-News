    "text": "A weatherman for News Channel Nebraska is having second thoughts about ‘bring your kid to work day’ after mistakenly bringing his kid to work.\nMeteorologist Brandon Aksamit was reporting on a snowstorm that hit the midwestern state when his adorable four-year-old daughter decided to pelt her father with snowballs.\n“That’s funny, but you can’t do that,” said a frustrated Aksamit. She is then seen crawling behind him on all fours, bringing the report to a halt.\nAksamit later posted the footage to Facebook with the comment: “When you quickly discover the potential pitfalls of bringing your four-year-old daughter with you for a … live snow report.”\nThe video has since been viewed 300,000 times and many viewers rightly delighted by the daughter’s antics.\n“Best news broadcast I have seen today,” wrote one fan to Facebook.\n“Almost made me spew coffee when I saw just the top of (her) hat crawl by!” said another.\n“I’ve watched this at least a dozen times. Please keep taking her to work with you!” penned another\nWhile another added: “When it’s a snow day and it becomes bring your child to work day, this is what happens! Can’t beat that big ole grin on her face!”\nAdvertise with us",

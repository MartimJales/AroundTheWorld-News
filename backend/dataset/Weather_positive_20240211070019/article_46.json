    "text": "Sylvan Hill Park to open Friday as snowstorms end lengthy hiatus WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - With no snow, many people had to wait for snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, and tubing. If you were to look outside now though, you’ll see lots of snow and [there’s plenty more on the way.](https://www.wsaw.com/2024/01/10/first-alert-weather-day-has-been-declared-friday-into-saturday/) Sylvan Hill Park in Wausau will be opening again on Friday at 6 p.m. When you show up Friday at Sylvan Hill Park you will only see three runs open. “So the hill [behind us] is not going to be open this weekend, so we will just have one hill open,” Marathon County and Wausau Parks, Recreation, and Forestry Superintendent Mark Dorow said. “We’re still making snow on that hill. We wanted to focus on just getting one open for the weekend with the weather we’ve had this week.” Preparations are still underway for Friday, but the crews are doing all they can to make sure all runs will be open by next week. “You can see [on your camera] we have our snow guns going. We’re just prepping, you know, our hill over here for this weekend and start to make snow on hill number two, so that way we can get going and have that up for future dates as well,” Dorow added. You may have seen pictures online of a pool of water at Sylvan Hill Park, but you won’t see that Friday. Luckily this year, the ground was still not frozen over, so we do have drainage down there that wasn’t frozen over,” Dorow explained. “You know, got rid of that water pretty fast, so that was nice.” Even with all the bad conditions Sylvan Hill Park has had to face, Dorow said he doesn’t think the park will be closing anytime soon. “I still feel that we’ve got a lot of winter ahead of us and you know, hope that we will get some snow and cold weather that way we can be open for the rest of the season,” he said. There will be two sessions on Saturday from 1-5:30 p.m. and another from 6-9:30 p.m. Dorow wants to remind people as the temperatures drop, dress warm and check their social media for any updates.

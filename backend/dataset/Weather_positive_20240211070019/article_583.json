    "text": "DesiRay Kernal arrived at North Texas’ postgame press conference following its game against Wichita State on Sunday carrying the pink tiara her teammates gave her.\nThe gift was a nice way to commemorate the senior forward’s 23rd birthday but isn’t what Kernal will remember.\nNot after she helped spark a dramatic comeback in UNT’s 72-68 win at the Super Pit.\nThe Mean Green trailed by 18 points late in the third quarter before storming back to win their third straight game in American Athletic Conference play. It was UNT's largest comeback win since Feb. 22, 2018 in a win over Old Dominion.\n“It’s an amazing birthday gift,” Kernal said. “Every game I’ve played in college on my birthday, we’ve won. This is great.”\nThe Mean Green (13-3) moved to 3-1 in conference play and continued to gain momentum in their first season under Jason Burton.\nBurton took over a team coming off an 11-win campaign and has spoken about changing the program’s culture. He pointed to the way the Mean Green rallied past Wichita State (5-12, 1-4) as a sign they are progressing toward that goal.\n“Our culture won the game,” Burton said. “During every timeout in the second half, they were saying the right things.\n“It’s easy when you get down 18 to start pointing the finger and check out. They were talking about getting stops.”\nThat approach helped UNT outscore Wichita State 30-15 in the fourth quarter.\nThe Mean Green leaned on the trio of Kernal, Dyani Robinson and Tommisha Lampkin in the final period. Kerbal and Robinson each scored 11 points, while Lampkin added eight.\nKernal finished with 21 points for the game. Robinson added 15 and Lampkin 12.\n“We ran and got points in transition and points in the paint,” Burton said. “We talked about that the entire game. We didn’t do a good job of getting the ball in the paint early.”\nUNT’s failure to get the ball inside left the Mean Green looking at a 32-24 halftime deficit.\nThe Mean Green made just one of their nine shots from 3-point range and gave up a costly 9-0 run. Wichita State continued to build on its lead and had a 50-32 edge late in the third quarter.\nUNT pulled within 53-42 heading into the final period, but still had a long way to go to complete the comeback.\n“We weren’t getting enough stops,” Kernal said. “Going into the fourth quarter, coach told us we got this. That is what we needed to hear.”\nKernal scored on a layup off an assist from Robinson just eight seconds into the fourth quarter. UNT was off and running from there.\nLampkin tied the game at 64-64 with a pair of free throws with 2:16 left. Kernal put UNT up with a steal and layup on the ensuing possession.\nThose four points were part of a 12-0 run that put UNT over the top. Tre’Zure Jobe banked in a 3 in the closing seconds to pull Wichita State within 70-68.\nThe Mean Green got the ball to Kernal, who hit two free throws with 4.9 seconds left to close out the game.\n“This can for sure be a confidence booster,” Burton said. “Until you been down 18 and come back to win, you don’t think you can do it. Now all of the sudden you’ve done it.”\nNorth Texas 72, Wichita State 68\nWICHITA STATE (5-12, 1-4) – Murray 5-9 0-0 11, Niankan 0-2 0-0 0, Abies 2-6 5-7 9, Nsabua 1-3 0-0 2, Blow 8-17 4-8 23, Bell 3-5 1-2 9, Morrow 0-4 0-0 0, Jobe 5-10 0-0 13, Thompson 0-1 0-0 0, McCarty 0-3 1-2 1.Totals 24-60 11-19 68.\nNORTH TEXAS (13-3, 3-1) – Kernal 7-13 7-10 21, Lampkin 5-7 2-4 12, Hardaway 1-2 0-0 2, Moore 4-10 0-0 9, Duncan 0-3 0-0 0, Wooten 1-2 0-0 3, Robinson 7-14 0-0 15, Mallard 0-1 0-0 0, Brackens 2-4 2-2 6, Johnson 1-1 2-2 4, Cleary 0-2 0-0 0.

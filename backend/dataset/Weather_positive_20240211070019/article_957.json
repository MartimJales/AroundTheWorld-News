    "text": "In New York City, the snow didn't cool down Buffalo Bills fans on Monday, January 15. While their team's game with the Pittsburg Steelers had already been postponed by a day due to a snowstorm, American football fans got their hands dirty. The goal is for the match to take place as scheduled. To ensure that the stadium was ready on time, supporters of both clubs did not hesitate to arm themselves with shovels to make the stands accessible to spectators. To thank them, they received a financial compensation of $20 per hour, free breakfast and drinks.\nRead also\"French American football\": the Musketeers of Paris, an ambitious young club\nAt the same time, bulldozers were busy on the ground to clear the snow. Mission accomplished: the match was able to take place on time. The temperature at kick-off was -8°C with a feeling of -16°C. The fans didn't hesitate to make the snow fly to celebrate each touchdown, in a good-natured atmosphere punctuated by snowball fights. The weather brought luck to the Buffalo Bills. They won their game 31-17.",

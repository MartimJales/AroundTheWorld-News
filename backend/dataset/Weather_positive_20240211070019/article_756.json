    "text": "We hope you’re getting through this cold blast without damage to your homes or vehicles. If you have to file an insurance claim, read on for expert tips.\nCONTINUE TO PROTECT PLUMBING At home, continue to protect your plumbing during the freeze. Drip faucets and open cabinets so warmer indoor air reaches pipes. In freezing weather events, plumbing damage becomes more apparent as temperatures rise and pipes thaw.\nIf pipes break and damage your home, hang onto the evidence.\nGet DFW local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC DFW newsletters . “If you have a burst pipe and the plumber cuts that section out, save it. You want to show that to the claims adjuster when they come out to do their inspection,” said Ware Wendell with Texas Watch, a consumer advocacy group.\nThe evidence shows the damage was caused by a pipe that broke in a freeze rather than a gradual leak.\n“Sometimes when consumers file claims, the insurance company comes back and says, that's wear and tear, that's lack of maintenance,” Wendell said. “They point the finger back at you and you need to be able to show them, no, this is a covered claim.”\nYour policy may also require you to keep evidence of your losses so insurance can inspect the damage.\n“Whether it's the broken pipe, whether it’s that damaged carpet, whether it’s damaged wood floors or cabinets, make sure that you can keep that or at least really document it well for your insurance claim. They're going to want to take a look at that and investigate,” said Rich Johnson with the Insurance Council of Texas.\nTake photos, and videos and save receipts for temporary repairs you make.\nDuring the claims process, document communication with your insurance company. If you talk by phone, follow up with an email highlighting what was discussed.\n“Start a log of everybody that you talked to from the insurance company: when you called them, what their name was, what they said. You want to document, document, document everything,” Wendell said.\nWhile we are talking about insurance, this is also a good time to take or update your home inventory. You can use your smartphone to record videos in each room. Open drawers and closets to document your possessions. Email the video to yourself for safekeeping.\nIf you have to file a claim after a disaster, you’ll have a video of the condition of your home and the contents inside.

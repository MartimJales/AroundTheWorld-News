    "text": "Despite winter storm, Down Wind sports is running strong MARQUETTE, Mich. (WLUC) - On Saturday with blizzard conditions, owners of one Marquette County store said they weren’t affected at all. Down Wind Sports in Marquette said they saw several customers in their store looking for last-minute items like boots, hats, and gloves on Saturday. Employees also said in the past during storms like this, they will see more traffic in the store. Co-owner Bill Thompson said the snow is what he and other Yoopers have been praying for. “People want snow, and they want to get out and so a lot of our customers are out on the woods today either cross-country skiing or snowshoeing,” Thompson said. “A lot of our customers are going out to the ski hill which just opened up and we are thankful for that so we are very excited to have this storm coming in,” Thompson also said now that the real winter has begun, he is hoping to see even more new customers in his store.

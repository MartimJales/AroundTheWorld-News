    "text": "PRINCETON — People volunteering to staff a warming station that will provide the homeless and others with a refuge during bitterly cold weather are now undergoing background checks. Commissioner Greg Puckett, who is also the executive director of Community Connections, Inc., updated the Mercer County Commission recently about the project’s status. Potential volunteers met Jan. 4 with county officials at The Salvation Army in Princeton. “We had a great meeting with about 30 representatives throughout the county that said that they would volunteer to come and work at a warming station at The Salvation Army. Capt. (Melissa) White said that she would gladly open that up in certain times,” Puckett said. “There are certain criteria that would be available that it could so when it gets down a certain windchill factor, incorporate the temperature plus the wind chill and that gives a baseline of whether or not that center will be open.” Traditionally, warming stations are open from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. It will need to be staffed throughout that period and it will provide temporary shelter. “So at nighttime, we want to make sure that somebody’s going to be safe and protected; and again, it’s not a homeless shelter,” Puckett stated. “It’s a warming center; so, somebody is in need at that moment. We’re going to be able to provide a little bit of food, clothing, shelter at that warming center.” Eighteen people filled out forms and gave their contact information. Community Connections is doing background checks. “They are going through the vetting process; so now, they’re going to go back and make sure that the background checks are done,” Puckett said. They’re also going to provide them the technical expertise, with Narcan training as well as CPR so that they will be trained and that these will be our network of volunteers.” The plan is to finish these background checks within two weeks. Sgt. Melissa White said that The Salvation has approved the warming station. “We’re going to move forward with it,” White said Thursday. “It’s just a matter of getting all the policies and procedures established. Community Connections has already started the background checks and once all those are completed, we should be able to continue to move forward.” White said a cold snap is expected next week, so The Salvation Army will use $7,500 provided by the Mercer County Commission to put people needing shelter in a local motel overnight. “So there will be enough of that to take care of people next week until we get open,” she said. When the warming station will open is difficult to predict, White said. It will depend on when the background checks are completed, how many volunteers will be available and when procedures are finished. “It will be at least middle of February before we’ll even be able to get to that point,” she stated. “We’re just going to keep plucking away at it.” How long a person could remain at the warming station will be determined by the staff at The Salvation Army. Puckett proposed to look during the commission’s budget time at opening warming stations in each of Mercer County’s five districts. While many of the county’s homeless people are around the cities of Bluefield and Princeton, others living in the more rural areas usually cannot get to a warming station in the cities. “I would ask that we look at partnerships with area churches that we identify at least one location in each district,” Puckett said. Creating these warming stations could involve entering into an agreement of a three to five-year period where the county provides them with resources such as a generator if they have issues with electricity, he stated. “The volunteer network would come to that facility via the church or another area around the county,” Puckett said. Opening a warming station in Princeton is a first step, but more are needed ,he stated. “It’s something that I’ll be making a proposal on in the next couple of months before budget,” Puckett said. — Contact Greg Jordan at [gjordan@bdtonline.com](mailto:gjordan@bdtonline.com)",

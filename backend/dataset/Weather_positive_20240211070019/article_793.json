    "text": "Firefighters help move resident inside during cold snap The College Station Fire Department went above and beyond Monday during the first cold snap of 2024 COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) - The College Station Fire Department went above and beyond Monday during the first cold snap of 2024. Firefighters were called to a house in College Station to help move Jack, a 150-pound, 24-year-old African spurred tortoise from his shed outside into the warmth of a home. Laura Adair’s family has had Jack since he was a baby and was only the size of a silver dollar. She said they moved him inside during the February 2021 freeze and made improvements to his habitat outside since then, but wanted to err on the side of caution. “We made his shelter more winter-proof this time but just with it being so much colder than it usually is we started kind of overthinking and wanted to move him inside so that he was for sure warmer,” Adair said. With the help of a recycling bin, firefighters were able to load Jack up from his pen in the backyard and get him inside. Helping jack the tortoise move inside to get out of the snow ❄️— College Station Fire Department (@CSTXFire) [pic.twitter.com/V1XUo5PyGU] [January 15, 2024] Jack is in hibernation now so he won’t need to eat and Adair added she’ll probably rely on her boyfriend and his brother to get Jack back outside once it warms up. Adair said she is grateful to the firefighters for taking some time to help Jack. Copyright 2024 KBTX. All rights reserved.",

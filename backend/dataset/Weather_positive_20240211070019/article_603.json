    "text": "KANAWHA COUNTY, W.Va. (WCHS) — As temperatures drop, some are without a warm place to sleep. That's where the warming center at Bream Neighborhood S.H.O.P. comes in. \"We're offering free beds for anybody who is cold,\" Bream Neighborhood S.H.O.P. Director Derek Hudson said. \"It doesn't matter if they've got a house and their heat is out or if they're homeless, come in, sleep. We have a lot of food, a lot of coffee. So we're just hoping anybody who needs it will come in.\" Inside, a warm meal and bed to sleep on awaits those in need. Larry Light told Eyewitness News he is very grateful. \"It means everything to me,\" Light said. \"Just me and my fiancé to go inside and get warm and everything.\" The City of Charleston has given funding to the warming center for the first time, allowing the center to adjust when it is open. \"Actually when we first started doing warming centers six years ago, the temperature was 10. So, we're now up to 20,\" Kanawha Valley Collective Executive Director Traci Strickland said. \"We say that our goal is that nobody freezes to death in the city of Charleston on the streets, and it's really that simple.\" Organizers said the most people the warming center has seen was 87 people, and they are preparing to see that many, or more, in the coming days. The warming center opened its doors Sunday night at 7 p.m. until 7 a.m.. Organizers said the plan is to be open those same times each day through Tuesday.",

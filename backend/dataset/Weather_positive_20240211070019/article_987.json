(WNDU) - With [ sub-freezing temperatures](https://www.wndu.com/2024/01/16/first-alert-weather-day-tuesday-dangerous-cold-lingers/) still affecting Michiana for the next couple of days, it’s important to maintain your water pipes because the last thing you need is a frozen pipe leading to a flooded basement. There are some measures you can take to prevent the freeze from happening. BluSky Restoration gave us some tips on 16 Morning News Now that you can start doing in your home today. First off, you should know where your water main line is located and how to turn it off. “If you do have an issue, you’re going to want to turn it off immediately,” said Mike Scott, vice president for BluSky Restoration. “That’s going to reduce the amount of water that can enter your home.” Pipes begin to experience issues once the temperature reaches below 20 degrees. “What is happening in many cases is the pipes are either not insulated properly or that extreme cold, the artic weather that we are getting is getting the pipes and it’s making it colder than it actually would be making it colder than it would originally be,” said Scott. “And as we all know if we have water and it freezes that ice expands and so what’s happening with your water if it doesn’t have a way to release the pressure in those pipes as ice is expanding the water doesn’t have anywhere to go. The ice is naturally pushing against the pipes that can cause them to break if that pressure isn’t released.” BluSky recommends having your faucets dripping water, even if its just one drip every couple of seconds. “It doesn’t seem like a lot, but that’s going to be enough to keep the water flowing through your pipe,” Scott said “To help reduce the chance of having a flood, it’s recommended doing it for the farthest sink from your water main. I recommend doing it for every sink.” You should also open up cabinets where your pipes are. This allows warm air into an area that usually doesn’t get warm air. BluSky recommends not using a space heater, but warns to leave it three feet away from any walls and always use it in a room you will monitor. If you do already have a frozen pipe your next steps should be turning off your main water line to limit how much water is coming into your home. Once it’s off, you’ll want to find where the freeze has happened. You can do this by going faucet to faucet, testing them until you isolate an area in the house. If you have exposed pipes, you can take a hair dryer to the area, slowly making its way through until melted. But even if a pipe freezes, it doesn’t always mean the pipe will burst, in fact, there are ways you can address frozen pipes too. “So there are different ways if you do have a frozen pipe to be able to slowly thaw out the ice, a hair dryer is the most recommended method. But what it does as ice is expanding it does compromise your pipes,” said Scott. “So you might not have a burst pipe, you might have what is considered a pine pole leaking your pipe. A lot of times that burst pipe might be a small hole that trickles over time so it’s not something you are going to see immediately your water is going to be working but you might eventually have a bigger issue down the line.” BluSky Restoration is located at 1919 S.

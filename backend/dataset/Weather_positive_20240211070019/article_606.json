    "text": "Im glad that the world has sorted itself out so well and we can spend a second day talking about the weather.\nüòâ\n+3deg f on the front porch this morning. +13deg f is the forecast high today in Makanda Township IL. One January morning in 1976 as I left for work at the Murphysboro IL Street Department about 10 miles from here the front porch thermometer showed -25deg f. Don‚Äôt mind if I never see that again.\nSometime in the recent past Dr. Joyner road tested a new format for OTB. It allowed contributors to embed cat videos with their comments. Too bad that didn‚Äôt work out.\nThe weather is another thing that we can‚Äôt do anything about, but have long accepted that we can‚Äôt. Lots of other stuff makes us angry and impotent, because we have no positive effect. Discussing the weather can be helpful.\nFor what‚Äôs it‚Äôs worth this morning, bright blue sky and low 30‚Äôs, that maybe the high for the week.\nFor those who live vicariously, our trip update:\nToday is the day that we (the wife and I) had scheduled our departure from Pensacola for Evergreen CO via RV.\nAs we are both avid snowboarders, getting back to the Summit County and making some freeride turns is our driving motivation.\nWhie google maps may say that is a 20-hour drive, in reality it is a 6-day drive of reasonable travel time and breaks, with overnight stays along the way.\n‚ÄúReasonable‚Äù being a mapped 4.5 hour drive (which becomes 6 usually start to finish). We tried longer segments but running an RV for a 10 hour goal became stupidly exhausting, with nights being far too short to get rest.\nLooking at the arctic blast, mapping out the weather for our route, it became obvious that leaving today would bring us into the potential of freezing rain in Jackson MS, northern LA and eastern TX. and continued bitter cold as we went westward.\nBy delaying departure until Wednesday, we may be leaving Pensacola on a chill morning (sub freezing low the night before in the gulf coast area), but with dramatically improved weather along the way, with highs in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs.\nOur planned travel takes us from Pensacola through Mobile AL for our first night stay in Jackson MS. Then on through LA to Kilgore TX, on through Dallas (‚Ä¶uugh. worlds worst drivers) to Witchita Falls, TX, up through Amarillo TX to Dumas TX, then through northern NM and up and over the mountain via Raton Pass toward Trinidad, a stay in southern Colorado in Walsenburg, and then a short drive ‚Äúup the hill‚Äù to our home near Genesee / Mt. Vernon.\nLast summer our drive to Colorado had us in Wichita Falls for the 114 degree heat wave. Outrageously miserable. Did not want to discover the other extreme of that spectrum.\nWhile fuel costs are always higher than one would like (as one can imagine it would be, driving a small home down the road), lodging/parking costs are inexpensive. We are not the type that pull into a Walmart and crank up the generator, so we look for interesting and cheap stops along the way. State Parks are usually reasonable, but we were surprised how many communities provide a free/donation RV spot with power, water and centralized sanitary dump.\nLeflur‚Äôs Bluff in Jackson and Lathrup State Park in Walsenburg CO fit in the first category, Kilgore, Wichita Falls and Dumas fit in the second.\nWell‚Ä¶ calling Dumas ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù is really a stretch. Let‚Äôs just say cheap for that one and let it go at that.\nFinally, no, I am NOT a person that considers himself a member of the RV culture or the ‚ÄúVan Life‚Äù smiling happy people youtube clique. This is just a way to connect two points for me.\nI like traveling by air, in the front of the plane. Roughing it for me is room service. This RV thing is such an anomaly. But I refuse to pretend that a 125lb malamute is a ‚Äúservice animal‚Äù to get him on a plane, so there is no other real option.\nI think the Leamonheads said it best:\nThe Outdoor Type\nKeep warm folks!\nApparently Mark Twain never said:\n‚ÄúThe coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.‚Äù\n@\nliberal capitalist: Kevin Drum has a chart, butI repeat myself, showing that, inflation adjusted, gas is as cheap as it‚Äôs been in the last 20 years. Way to go Brandon.\nI used to tow to races in an RV. Typically relatively short distances so I wasn‚Äôt that upset about fuel cost.But it was a nuisance that gas for a while was over $5 and I couldn‚Äôt fill the tank because of the $75 dollar limit on credit card transactions at the dispenser.\nThe one day game I attended at the stick back in the‚Äô80s was at least that bad but Giants came from behind to beat the Mets in xtra innings so it was good times.\n(No runner on 2nd base to start the 10th inning. That rule makes me want to puke.)\n@\nBill Jempty: Laura Loomer, ‚Äúa far-right Florida (of course) activist and former congressional candidate‚Äù charged that Nikki Haley‚Äôs defense contractor donors arranged the bad weather for the Iowa caucus.\nThe other day, during one of The Bulwark‚Äôs podcasts, Ben Wittes recommended Ionescu‚Äôs Rhinoceros as an absurdist political allegory, with a lot of relevance for our time. After reading it yesterday, boy howdy, is he right. While people keep turning into rhinoceroses, other people just dither, worrying about the wrong things. There are definite connections with today‚Äôs dithering, such as the endless articles about what Trump voters really want, the ridiculous pretense of life going on as normal (hence the obsessive media focus on the meaningless Republican debates), and the hesitations in calling things what they really are. It‚Äôs a short read, and worth it.\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861046: South edge of Sarasota county here. Howdy.\nMore of the intersection between literature and our current unpleasantness:\nI‚Äôm re-reading Beowulf. While Googling for answers to questions I had about some odd elements of the story I had forgotten (swimming in armor?!?), I found a blog with the enticing title, Better Living Through Beowulf. One of the featured posts,\n‚ÄúHow Beowulf Can Save America,‚Äù an excerpt from the author‚Äôs book, is definitely worth reading. It describes Beowulf as a parable about anger, and how it can turn us into monsters.\nIn America today we do not face threats of death and enslavement. We do, however, face a roiling anger that is undermining our governing institutions, setting citizen against citizen, and preventing collective problem-solving. In its account of Beowulf battling and defeating the three monsters, the epic captures our own situation and shows us how to deal with it.\nWe‚Äôre an angry country. The traditional liberal view of politics has been, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs identify the sources of the anger, and deal with it. Then the anger will go away.‚Äù However, that perspective overlooks that the problem may also be the anger itself. People can get drunk on anger, especially given the ease with which they can justify their anger as righteous. Whether it‚Äôs Anglo-Saxons revenging themselves on their neighbors for stolen livestock, or a segment of white Americans outraged that their Mayberry vision of the United States doesn‚Äôt exist, people can quickly turn into angerholics.\nGenerative AI is going to kill Google. I‚Äôm setting up a specific brand of Network Attached Storage on my home network and wanted to see if I could use it as a drive for Time Capsule. I googled ‚ÄúHow do I use a Buffalo NAS as a Time Capsule drive‚Äù and saw that the first thing that popped up was from a user who did specifically that thing. Oh Joy! ‚Ä¶ and then realized that it was just generative AI bullshit and didn‚Äôt offer any real help at all. Then I scanned down the next 7-8 Google hits. Yep, same kind of bullshit. At least the awkward language, the bizarre emphasis on irrelevant details, and the logorrhea tips you off. But as it gets ‚Äúbetter‚Äù that tip off will go away. It will still provide bullshit though.\nOne of the most amazing and useful things about the internet: searching for a somewhat unusual use case and finding someone who has done that very thing. And now it‚Äôs gone, almost overnight. I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll ever be able to use it that way again.\n@\nKingdaddy: Serendipitously, Kevin Drum hits the same theme today. He starts by quoting a Peggy Noonan column on the danger Trump supporters see in our modern world. Then quotes a similar column of hers from the 70s. Drum concludes,\nWe all live in the richest country in the richest era of history. We‚Äôre mostly well paid, well fed, and get good medical care. We have so many entertainment options we barely know how to handle them. If we‚Äôd all just buck up and stop being scared of the monsters under our beds, maybe we‚Äôd finally figure out just how much of life there is to enjoy.\nMaybe the lesson is that we shouldn‚Äôt be sending out Cletus safaris to find the causes of their discontent so we can address them. Maybe it‚Äôs like stochastic terrorism. Maybe the problem is that the potential for Trumpian faux populism is always there, under the surface, available for amoral politicians, Huey Long, Hitler, Orban, etc., to summon it up. More of a psychological than political leaning. Maybe the actionable problem is the amoral politicians.\nWe could, as one example, reform our candidate selection process so it doesn‚Äôt promote opportunistic extremists. Or enforce the clear Constitutional prohibition against someone holding an office who has previously violated an oath of office by attempting to overthrow the government\nI had not really been following the Bill Ackman stuff that closely. I had thought his wife‚Äôs plagiarism was limited to some footnote and quotation errors. Turns out she copied entire paragraphs. Not surprisingly, the guy thinks it‚Äôs OK when it was his wife. My bet at the time with Gay, and it still remains, is that low level plagiarism is actually very common. People consciously or not writing almost word for word what they read elsewhere. I think when you are writing technical stuff and someone else has worded something well it just sticks with you.\nHowever, it turns out the guy is a whackadoodle in a number of areas. Including supporting Sam Bankman-Fried up until he was convicted, supporter of RFK as an anti-vaxxer and Kyle Rittenhouse was a patriot.\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/01/bill-ackman-neri-oxman-plagiarism-wikipedia-insider-harvard-mit.html\nSteve\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861047: ‚ÄúIonescu‚Äôs Rhinoceros as an absurdist political allegory‚Äù\nThere was also a film version made for the short-lived American Film Theater in 1974, starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. You can rend it on Amazon‚Ä¶\n@\nMarkedMan: Yesterday I was just trying to ask Google about a map of the Dakar Rally, because I was made aware that it no longer went to Dakar, Senegal. Google provided completely baffling results which were useless, for example telling me about some street market in Dakar. This shit used to work.\nAfter asking seven different ways, I finally just went to Wikipedia and discovered it moved to South America at one point due to unrest in Mauritania, then eventually to Saudi Arabia. It turns out it was the history that I was curious about, which would have normally come up in the first page or two of Google results. Now they apparently decide what they think you‚Äôre asking, usually incorrectly, and then only give you an answer for that wrong question.\n@\nKingdaddy: I read the Seamus Heaney translation a few years ago when it came out. It was so much more enjoyable than when it was forced upon me in school. Hope you enjoy it.\nI‚Äôm re-reading Beowulf.\nHw√¶t!?\nOh Joy! ‚Ä¶ and then realized that it was just generative AI bullshit and didn‚Äôt offer any real help at all. Then I scanned down the next 7-8 Google hits. Yep, same kind of bullshit.\nI keep waiting for Google to offer a feedback mechanism on search results that allows you to flag crap, presumably with a captcha-equivalent test for being an actual person. Surely that information would be extremely useful to them, and users would be happy to provide it‚Ä¶\n@\nFranklin: I commented above about Laura Loomer‚Äôs craziness @ gVOR10:. I couldn‚Äôt remember which female RW loon has said it. Try writing a Google search string today ‚ÄúXYZ Iowa caucus‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt return a huge list of standard issue ‚ÄúIowa caucus‚Äù less XYZ. Their algorithms seem to hugely prioritize popularity over content.\n@\nFranklin:\nNow they apparently decide what they think you‚Äôre asking\nUnfortunately I suspect it‚Äôs worse than that. I don‚Äôt think those are Google answers for the most part. It‚Äôs dozens of people trying to monetize AI.\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861066:\nMaybe the problem is that the potential for Trumpian faux populism is always there, under the surface, available for amoral politicians, Huey Long, Hitler, Orban, etc., to summon it up. More of a psychological than political leaning.\nThis.\nOf course, this has been true all along of conservatism, as well. There are no conservative policies ‚Äî the same policy can be conservative or anti-conservative, depending on when and where you propose it. Republicanism was radically anti-conservative 300 years ago, and is conservative now. Evangelical Christianity was radically anti-conservative 200 years ago, and still is in the UK, but is conservative here. Gun control is deeply conservative in the UK and deeply anti-conservative in the US. Ditto national health care, national educational standards, etc. When it isn‚Äôt a fig leaf for raw greed, conservatism is a psychological phenomenon tied to asymmetric risk aversion. The least comprehensible argument of all to a conservative is ‚Äúwhat have we got to lose?‚Äù.\nApparently Mark Twain never said:\n‚ÄúThe coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.‚Äù\nThe inverse of that is beautiful January days like today, blue skies, crisp air & mid-high 50s. I‚Äôm in the East Bay, but SF is about the same today. It‚Äôs probably a fantastic day to drive up the coast, but I‚Äôve got work to do.\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861036:\n‚Ä¶ showing that, inflation adjusted, gas is as cheap as it‚Äôs been in the last 20 years.\nOh, this I know. But it‚Äôs still $800 ‚Äì $1000 to do that 1500 mile trip.\nI justify it in my head, thinking that it is in the realm of possibility that two airline tickets + massive dog crate could also cost me approximately the same to do that trip.\nHowever, as a former Chevy Bolt owner that had (what felt like) free power for 4 years, seeking out that cheap pump sucks.\n@\nsteve:\nMy bet at the time with Gay, and it still remains, is that low level plagiarism is actually very common. People consciously or not writing almost word for word what they read elsewhere. I think when you are writing technical stuff and someone else has worded something well it just sticks with you.\nOne of the textbooks that I used in the writing from sources class (Eng. 102 at my schools) that I taught from suggested that source material always be copied word-for-word from the source for research notes.* The reason to copy exactly was that as the writer revises their draft, their paraphrases will move back toward the original source material so writers need exact copies of their source material‚Äôs paraphrased content to check against.\n(Of course, given that Ackman is an enemy, and a political one at that, this information should not be used in an attempt to somehow imagine any excuse or explanation of what happened. Oxman‚Äôs actions cannot possibly be anything other than nefarious. üòê )\n*Until I used the specific text this suggestion had come from, I don‚Äôt recall ever having heard this suggestion before‚Äìeven though I had taken a year-long research workshop while I was writing the thesis for my degree in music history. Then again, universities only taught composition to ‚Äúremedial‚Äù students in those days. The rest of us learned how to write before we got to college and didn‚Äôt need any instruction.\nHere‚Äôs a good explanation of the MAX 9 door plug‚Äôs workings, and informed speculation on how the incident may have happened.\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861095: Amazon has 3rd party people (or non-people algorithms) using AI to generate product descriptions, sometimes resulting in error messages as product names. https://futurism.com/amazon-products-ai-generated\nOur dystopian present is not what we imagined it would be 20 years ago when it was our dystopian future.\n(I was predicting e-ink tattoos that show ads until you pay them off. It can still happen, but now I expect it to be a subscription you need to pay for the rest of your life, until the managing company stops supporting it and you have error messages. Also it would be a target for hackers and ransomware)\nI grew up in Chicago, which is fairly cold and windy and then spent ten years in Rochester, NY, which is even more cold and windy. Now I live in Maryland where grown-ass people huddle inside on any day lower than 50 and whine about the cold like little babies. I was just out for a walk along the Inner Harbor and I had a revelation: they literally don‚Äôt know how to dress themselves. It was cold, but not super cold, maybe 36, but windy as hell. Had to walk backwards through a couple of spots where a some buildings pinched off a wind tunnel. I saw all these people wearing what looked like serious coats but in a worse than useless way. Loose at the bottom and not zipped all the way up, so as to leave plenty of room around the neck. In other words, their coat was a chimney, guaranteed to suck all the heat out. And not one in ten had their damn hood up, the thing specifically designed to block the wind. I was out for an hour and a half with a proper coat, hat and gloves and hiking half boots with a decent sole. My only concern with heat was when I got away from the water and into a neighborhood which blocked the wind a bit so I had to readjust zippers and such to keep from getting overheated.\nI have a friend who was the victim of a violent crime about a week ago, and a third friend and I were helping them around yesterday to be supportive and help keep them calm. Unfortunately, they had something of a breakdown in a train station. While we were trying to comfort them, this lady kind of sidled up and had the unmitigated gall to try and use that moment as a hook to proselytize to them, and what the ever loving fuck is wrong with people these days.\n@\nKathy: That was good. Thanks\nI know there are a few people here who follow Libertarian sites and I was wondering how they are treating their boy, Milei, in Argentina, given that he‚Äôs going all in shifting that country to Libertarian principles. Are they ignoring him? Embracing him? Predicting that Argentina will shortly rule the world?\n@\nStormy Dragon: When I worked on campaigns ages ago, I was onsite in district for a special election and was in a car accident. The candidate‚Äôs wife tried that crap with me maybe an hour after my car got towed away, asking me if I had died in the wreck, would I have been saved.\nLet‚Äôs just say that incident didn‚Äôt endear me to religion, particularly that flavor of proselytizing. I really have a BIG BIG problem with people who cannot keep that stuff to themselves. Read the room, lady.\n@\nJen:\nPeople like that candidate‚Äôs wife either can‚Äôt read the room or refuse to do so.\n@\nKurtz:\nAwwww, I think it‚Äôs kinda cute. Like he‚Äôs the rave mom trying to get his lil‚Äô wooks in line before raging.\n@\nKurtz:\nAwwww, I think it‚Äôs kinda cute. Like he‚Äôs the rave mom trying to get his lil‚Äô wooks in line before raging.\nYou‚Äôre welcome.\nIf you ever get interested in aviation accidents, the same guy runs a channel called Mentour Pilot where he deals largely with such things. Production values lag far behind Air Crash Investigations, but his info is more accurate.\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861132:\nMentour\nI don‚Äôt know whether a Mentour is going to be a very fun time, or a truly terrible time. Really could go either way and be anything from gay burlesque to incel incorporated.\n(Probably just some guys slightly odd family name and he‚Äôs sick of the jokes, but he‚Äôs not here, is he?)\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861121: Marginal Revolution mentions Milei. Not a lot about him, but a point of interest. And his success seems to be assumed. The attitude seems to be that Libertarianism cannot fail, it can only be failed.\n(It‚Äôs hard to get Milei past spell check.)\nDoug Burgum endorsed Trump for president. Apparently when Obama he disrespected all the heartland states, and trying to work with his administration was a disaster. Maybe it was like Cleavon Litle in Blazing Saddles. he couldn‚Äôt get past the color of his skin. Guys like Burgum truly have no integrity.\n@\nBeth:\n‚ÄúHere we go-ohhhhhh‚Äù\nNah. I like Dak, but man. I don‚Äôt know wtf that is.\nOn another note, decent chance that this kills any hope for Arthur Blank to get Belichick to Atlanta. I doubt McCarthy survives this.\nA couple weeks ago, I commented to someone that I couldn‚Äôt see Belichick tolerating Jones and Son. But since then, I‚Äôve read some seemingly solid reporting that there is mutual admiration between Jerry and BB. If that‚Äôs the case, that seems to be a likely destination for the sith lord.\n@\nKathy:\nJust to add: The reports of loose bolts apply to the two that hold the lower brackets to the plane, not the retaining pins, and are visible on the shot at 16:30. Like he said all reports in the press are questionable though.\nI‚Äôm curious about that myself. I may take a look at some point soon.\nI know one thing, if I see a description of a person that includes something to the effect a economist of the Austrian School, I feel pretty comfortable dismissing that person.\nBut that dismissal is a little harder to do when that person is influential in some way, and impossible if that person is a head of state.\n@\nhttps://www.outsidethebeltway.com#comment-2861145: Here is my prediction. Absolute failure, at which point Libertarians will memory hole him and never mention him again. They will not think about the failure or learn from it in any way.\nRemember Sam Brownback? Savior of Kansas? The one who would finally show the world and all the haters the unbelievable success a libertarian government would bring? Well, if you remember him you must not be a libertarian, because they certainly don‚Äôt.\n[I had to look him up. He resigned as governor in 2018 to become Trump‚Äôs Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, whatever that was]\n@\nSenyorDave: I think we have new candidate for Chief Sycophant aka VP in the running.\nPredictable play: a nobody candidate drops out, throws support to the frontrunner in the hopes he will get picked for the term in which the hamberders catch up with him.\nThe Detroit Lions just won a playoff game, their first playoff victory since defeating the Dallas Cowboys on January 5, 1992.\nNext Sunday they‚Äôll meet‚Ä¶either the Eagles or the Buccaneers, it‚Äôs not decided yet.

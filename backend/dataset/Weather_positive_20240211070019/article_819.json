And who likes wet socks? Wet socks are gross.”\nBy Monday morning, school districts across the entire Mid-South began sending out notices to families that schools would remain closed, especially Memphis Shelby County Schools.\nJerrolds says once she found out school would be closed for at least the next two days, she knew exactly what her days off would consist of.\n“I love sleeping in on snow days. That's my favorite - sleeping in on snow days.”\nJoy’s mom, Jennifer, said she did all the grocery shopping and prepping before the storm.\n“Extra chargers are found so that we can have all of our electronics and we pull out all the board games, make sure all the cards are accounted for, all the parts, and we make sure we have snacks, snacks on deck, lists of movies, that sort of thing, things that are going to keep busy.”\nBut still, Jerrolds said the power outages are the biggest concern as the week progresses.\n“That's my number one concern this week. Batten down for the cold. We can buy all the snacks we want. But if the power goes out, all of our plans are for not.”\nThe temperatures will continue to drop tonight heading into overnight so the concern is still slick sidewalks and roadways.\nIf you are planning to get out the house, make sure you have your coat, gloves, and boots so your feet don’t get wet or cold.",

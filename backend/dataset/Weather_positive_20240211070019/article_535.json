    "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. — On April 8, New York State will experience its first total solar eclipse in nearly a century. Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced updated statewide plans for eclipse safety. According to a press release from the governor’s office, during the afternoon of April 8, within a window of 3:15 to 3:30 p.m., the moon will pass between the earth and sun, turning day into night for 1 ½ minutes to 3 ½ minutes. The roughly 100-mile wide path of totality will enter in the southwestern part of the state at just after 3:15 p.m., and will depart northern New York just before 3:30. Cities and towns within this path include Jamestown, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Watertown, Old Forge, Lake Placid and Plattsburgh. For other areas of the state that are outside the path, there will still be quite a celestial spectacle. The minimum coverage in the state will be on Long Island, with the sun being shadowed at 88 percent there. New York City will see 89 percent coverage with 96 percent in the Capital Region. The entire event will last for up to 2 ½ hours, marking the time the sun is first obstructed to the last moments when the moon’s shadow is cast. “Whether you live in New York or are visiting to witness this generational spectacle, ensuring everyone can take in this year’s eclipse safely is our top priority,” Hochul said in a news release. “I encourage everyone to keep safety in mind so that all can savor this experience and make memories to last a lifetime. Come for the eclipse, but stay for New York and enjoy all our great state has to offer.” For the last 15 months, an interagency task force comprised of nearly two dozen state agencies and authorities has been collaborating on plans to ensure a safe and memorable viewing experience for New York State’s residents and visitors. The eclipse is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of spectators from out of state. Public safety challenges for such an event include traffic management, communications capabilities and public health and safety. State, county and local public safety and emergency management efforts have been and will continue to be tailored to the anticipated needs from an influx of those who come to view the eclipse from both inside and outside New York. “It’s been nearly 100 years since New York last experienced a total solar eclipse and thankfully we will not have to wait much longer. With our state so uniquely positioned to view this celestial wonder, people from around the country will be flocking to New York to see it for themselves and we will be ready. As April 8 quickly approaches, we will continue to work hand in glove with our local partners to ensure it will be a safe and enjoyable experience for all,” Jackie Bray, New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner, said in the release. The task force is focused on building awareness of New York as a prime location to experience the eclipse by gathering important safety and preparedness information, amplifying and supporting region-specific viewing activities, and maintaining regular communication with local governments and municipalities, especially those within the path of totality. The state’s goals surrounding the eclipse are to provide a safe, fun and enjoyable experience from start to finish. “The New York State Police is working closely with our local and state partners preparing for any potential increase in traffic and large gatherings that the eclipse may bring. We are making preparations to ensure the safety of the motoring public, including deploying additional troopers as needed. We also remind the public to watch the eclipse from designated viewing areas and to avoid stopping on controlled access highways unless there is an emergency. The New York State Police wants everyone to safely enjoy this rare event,” New York State Police Acting Superintendent Dominick Chiumento said in the release. Alongside the focus on public safety is the promotion of New York State as an eclipse vacation destination. New York State and I LOVE NY are encouraging eclipse viewers to extend an eclipse viewing trip into a full vacation for a more enjoyable experience all around – including avoiding post-event traffic, like the massive backups after the Great Eclipse of 2017, which bisected the United States from Oregon to South Carolina. I LOVE NY has launched the multi-platform “Come for the Eclipse, Stay for New York” campaign to present New York as THE place to be to witness this event. The campaign and a special eclipse website highlight viewing location information in the five regions that will experience the path of totality. Also included will be a variety of attractions and special eclipse-related events happening across the state, and safety best practices across digital platforms such as social media. The website will have resources for educators, families and kids, along with photos and frequently asked questions about solar eclipses. Visitors can download a special edition eclipse poster, created through an I LOVE NY partnership with acclaimed artist and professional astronomer Dr. Tyler Nordgren to help promote and commemorate the eclipse. “We are so excited have the total solar eclipse line up as part of our Centennial celebration. Within days of announcing several parks along its path would open early, reservations filled up for campgrounds, cottages and cabins. We expect an influx of visitors headed to several regions across New York State to witness this extraordinary cosmic event,” New York State Parks Commissioner Erik Kulleseid said in the release. As this once-in-a-lifetime event approaches, meetings and briefings will continue with agencies and governments across the state to continue preparation. In addition, the Governor’s office will be providing updates on relevant milestones and features to keep New Yorkers and its visitors informed on how to best prepare, be safe and enjoy the eclipse.",

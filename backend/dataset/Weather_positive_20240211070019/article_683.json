    "text": "The Caledonia Area Warriors boys basketball team looked to restart its rhythm against the Plainview-Elgin-Millville Bulldogs on Thursday, Jan. 11 at Caledonia Area High School after a game cancellation earlier in the week . After a slow start, the Warriors regained their momentum and beat the Bulldogs 85-42. The Warriors started out the game by winning the toss, and Ethan Stendel (No. 14) scored the first points with a rebound put back for two. Shortly after, PEM would go up 8-2, but the Warriors would even it out by 14:30 in the first half. Ball security was a bit of a problem early for the Warriors, as it allowed the Bulldogs to stay in the game and generate points off those turnovers. Midway through the half, the Warriors spread offense and defense both picked up the pace, and they saw Caledonia take control of the game. The Bulldogs also got themselves into some pretty heavy foul trouble in the first half, which allowed the Warriors some extra points from the charity strike. By the end of the half, the Warriors were in solid control by a score of 47-21. The second half saw much of the same by the Warriors with domination on offense and defense. The Warriors opened the half with five points, and they continued their efficient scoring and defense with a lead of 62-24 at 14:30, 68-27 at 11:30, 82-35 at 5:30, and finally the final score of 85-42. Despite the rougher start, the Warriors were able to get back into their own and dominate both sides of the court. Top Caledonia scorers were Ethan Stendel, who had a big game with 19 points, Lewis Doyle (No. 2) with 14 points, and Garrett Konz (No. 10) and Reid Klug (No. 12) with 13 points each. Leo Privet (No. 25) hit a big three late in the game from the corner. The Warriors will look to face off against Dover-Eyota at Dover-Eyota on Monday, Jan. 15, and then Lewiston-Altura at home on Thursday, Jan. 18. Subscribe to The Caledonia Argus",

(WAFB) - Entergy Louisiana announced it will temporarily stop disconnecting power to customers’ homes who have not paid their bills out of an abundance of caution for customer safety. According to the company, it is suspending disconnections due to non-payment from Monday, Jan. 15 through Friday, Jan. 19, due to prolonged freezing temperatures in the region. After Jan. 19, the company will take a day-by-day approach, giving careful consideration to the prolonged period of extreme cold and following the La. Public Service Commission’s orders, officials added.

    "text": "In pictures: Belfast Zoo animals take in the first snow of the year Some were even out making snowballs! While they may not have to defrost their cars or worry about the heating bill, the residents of Belfast Zoo also are dealing with how to handle the cold weather. Belfast Zoo shared with us some snaps of their cold-loving animals making the most of the first snow on 2024 on Monday to cheer up this Blue Monday. A spokesperson for the zoo said: \"The animals of Belfast Zoo woke to a winter wonderland this morning. \"While many of the resident animals preferred to stay tucked up in their heated houses, some decided to have some fun in the elements. \"Species such as the penguins and red pandas naturally thrive in such conditions. \"However, others surprised their keepers with their willingness on getting out into the snow, such as the gorillas who took breakfast outside with silverback Gugas making snowballs for a treat.\" Check out the animals in the snow in our gallery below...

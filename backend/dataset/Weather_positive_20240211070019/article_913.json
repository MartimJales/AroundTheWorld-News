    "text": "PHILADELPHIA (KYW Newsradio) — The drought is over. After 715 days without seeing significant snowfall, the Philadelphia region got several inches overnight. So far, 3.3 inches of snow has been measured by Philadelphia International Airport. Bethel Township in Delaware County is leading the snow total with 4 inches. Norristown, Montgomery County is right behind it with 3.9 inches. About 2.5 inches fell overnight in King of Prussia. Some snow, sleet and freezing rain are expected in the midday hours but with little additional accumulation. However, slippery conditions may lead to travel disruptions. A winter weather advisory remains in effect until 1 p.m. Temperatures will drop to the teens overnight, creating icy conditions. Looking ahead, the forecast calls for more snow on Friday. CLICK HERE FOR SCHOOLS CLOSING AND DELAYS AAA Mid-Atlantic is urging drivers to keep a snow emergency kit in their cars — and if they already have one, make sure it’s stocked. “People get out of practice, especially during that first snow of the season,” said AAA Mid-Atlantic spokesperson Jana Tidwell. She said drivers should keep a shovel and extra road traction material on hand, like a bag of sand or kitty litter, which can be used to free a vehicle if it gets stuck. If you are stranded and waiting for help to arrive, it’s useful to have things like flashlights, blankets, sweatshirts, gloves, nonperishable food, and drinking water. If possible, drivers should stay off the roads during a winter storm altogether. Tidwell said AAA experiences an increase in calls for roadside assistance during these weather events. Priority is given to those stranded in the most dangerous conditions. If you must hit the road, slow down and allow plenty of room between you and the vehicles around you. “If you have to brake, please don’t slam on your brakes,” Tidwell advised. “Brake gradually. Having room between the cars around you will give you the room to do that. Be very careful on- and off-ramps, as they have a tendency to freeze over before the roads do.\" “Primarily, we want to give road crews and emergency responders the room they need to do their jobs — to clear the roads, to help any stranded motorists who are out there. So if you can stay off the roads during this kind of weather event, please do so for your safety and the safety of others.”",

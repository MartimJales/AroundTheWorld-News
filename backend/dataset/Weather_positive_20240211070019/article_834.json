    "text": "Dubuque caucusgoers turn out in large numbers despite frigid temperatures DUBUQUE, Iowa (WMTV) - Iowa caucusgoers turned out in large numbers at the Dubuque Senior High School Monday, despite dangerously cold temperatures. With wind chills in double-digits below zero, voters still wanted to cast the first votes of the 2024 presidential election year. “You bet I did!” said Mark Chapman, attending his first caucus. “Absolutely. I wouldn’t have missed this,” said Sybil Shroeder. She said even very cold temperatures couldn’t keep her away. “Oh, my I’d say probably about -20 or -30.” A number of people WMTV 15 News spoke to Monday were first time caucus-goers. That included Chapman who is attending his first at 62 years old. Voters like Chapman said it’s important to get involved in the election season early. “Come out and do your civic duty, you don’t have a say when you go just vote, those are all picked out, you have a chance to kind of pick who you want to be in there,” he said. Before the vote, people had a chance to address the crowd to show their support for a given candidate. Then each precinct, there were nine, went to different areas in the school to cast their votes. When everything was tallied, Donald Trump earned the most votes with 206, followed by Ron DeSantis with 57 and Nikki Haley with 55. “I wouldn’t have missed it for anything to be honest with you,” said first time caucusgoer Mark Schnee, “My wife goes, why are you going? I said, because I can.” The results represent the [ first milestone](https://www.wmtv15news.com/2024/01/16/trump-wins-iowa-caucuses-crucial-victory-outset-republican-presidential-campaign/) in what will be a monthslong effort by Trump to secure the GOP nomination a third consecutive time.

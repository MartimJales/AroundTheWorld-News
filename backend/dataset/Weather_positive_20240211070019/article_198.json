(KLKN) – Nebraska troopers are back on the roads helping travelers during this week’s second winter storm. In a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/NEStatePatrol/posts/pfbid02gnMGE1TkyeetK1eD2rS31qxQH7uHNn3v7NzTnKQiHE4RuYdX8Ze9mPCbsrY9RNfel), the Nebraska State Patrol said roads across the state are affected by blowing snow and slick conditions. Troopers are experiencing near white out conditions all around the Omaha Metro areas. This includes Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, Dodge, and Washington counties. Please help us by doing your part and staying home. Troopers are call to call 24 hours a day right now. [pic.twitter.com/utohZLtqyu] — NSP Troop A Day Shift (@NSP_TroopA) [January 12, 2024] Troopers have “been busy” with slide-offs and stranded motorists, according to the patrol. Over 100 travelers have been helped. “Stay off the roads if you can, but if you must travel slow down and be safe,” the patrol said in the post. Updated road conditions can be found on [Nebraska 511](https://www.511.nebraska.gov/). Get the latest weather updates by going to [klkntv.com/weather](https://www.klkntv.com/weather/).

    "text": "Showers and storms to move in late Friday into early Saturday morning. Showers and storms to move in late Friday into early Saturday morning. CHIEF METEOROLOGIST TONY MAINOLFI JOINS US NOW. TONY TOO MANY CLOUDS TOMORROW. WE MAY NOT SEE. WOW. YES, I TELL YOU WHAT. UP TOWARDS HEATHROW ELEMENTARY NOW WITH OUR, UH, LIVE WEATHER STEM CAMERAS HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT’S JUST PRETTY RIGHT THERE. KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A PURPLE BOWL SHOT RIGHT THERE. AND THEN A LITTLE BIT FARTHER TO THE NORTH AND THE EAST, UH, UP TOWARDS DAYTONA BEACH. YOU CAN SEE CLOUDY, OVERCAST, NOT RAINING THERE. BUT IT WON’T BE LONG UNTIL THIS FRONT BEGINS TO LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH. AND ONCE THAT STARTS HAPPENING, THAT MOISTURE IS GOING TO SNEAK NORTHWARD AND THEN WE’LL WAIT ON THAT LOW COMING OUT OF COLORADO TO RACE ACROSS THE GULF IN THE SOUTHEAST, EAST HERE, AND GIVE US A SHOT OF SOME SHOWERS AND STORMS. LOOK AT THE MOISTURE NOW BEGINNING TO PULL UP TOWARDS THE NORTH. IN THE EAST YOU CAN SEE FUTURE CAST HERE HINTING AT THE CHANCE HERE FOR A COUPLE OF DOWNPOURS DURING THE THE MORNING HOURS TOMORROW. LET ME GET YOU INTO THE AFTERNOON. DEPENDING UPON HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WE GET, WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE OF ISOLATED, STRONGER, MAYBE MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS DURING THE MID AFTERNOON, BUT WE MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS LINE HERE TO APPROACH MARION COUNTY AND THEN SLOWLY DROP SOUTHWARD. AND AS IT’S DOING SO, YOU CAN SEE A LINE OF SOME SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS. 1 OR 2 MAY BECOME MARGINALLY SEVERE, BUT THIS IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE LOOKING AS OF RIGHT NOW COMPARED TO WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS TIME YESTERDAY. SO SEVERE TIMELINE FOR US TONIGHT. SHOWERS WORKING ON IN ALONG THAT WARM FRONT THAT WE’LL WATCH DURING THE AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT FRIDAY AS THAT FRONT APPROACHES THINGS SHOULD BE CALMER. COOLER AS WE GET YOU ON INTO SATURDAY AFTERNOON. SO A LEVEL ONE OUT OF FIVE HERE FOR THAT RISK. AGAIN A LEVEL ONE MEANS 1 OR 2 MARGINAL SEVERE STORMS. AGAIN JUST BARELY PUSHING 40 PLUS MILES AN HOUR IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. TORNADO HAIL, FLOODING RAINS. NOT A CONCERN THIS GO AROUND. WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE TEMPERATURES TOMORROW. LOOK AT THE HEAT 80 OR BETTER. ORLANDO ON SOUTH AND EAST. LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE ATTRACTIONS FORECAST HERE. AS YOU CAN SEE, SEAWORLD MILD MORNING ON INTO THE AFTERNOON. A FEW LATE DAY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS GET GOING, BUT IT’S AFTER SUNSET THAT FRONT APPROACHES AND WE GET A LINE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT WILL MARCH ON IN AS WE GET YOU ON INTO SUNDAY. THERE WILL BE MOISTURE AROUND AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF SUNDAY, AND THEN IT GETS A PUSH SOUTH AND EAST, COMPLIMENTS OF THIS BIG HIGH. IT WILL BE DRIER AND COOLER IN OUR NORTHERN COMMUNITIES, BUT THE MOISTURE WILL STICK AROUND, I THINK A LITTLE BIT LONGER THROUGH POLK, OSCEOLA AND BREVARD COUNTY. A LITTLE COOLER OVER THE WEEKEND TOO. WON’T BE IN THE UPPER 70S. LOW 80S WILL BE IN THE 60S. RAIN CHANCES ON SUNDAY, AND OUR SOUTHERN COMMUNITIES RUNNING AT ABOUT 30%. NOW WE TAKE A LOOK AT TUESDAY ON INTO WEDNESDAY HERE. THE FRONT DOES MOVE ON IN. WE MAY HAVE A LITTLE QUICK OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME STRONGER STORMS HERE AS WELL. AND THEN WHAT? WE’LL WATCH BEHIND THIS IS THE MODELS ARE TRYING TO BRING IN SOME COLD AIR ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. WILL IT MAKE IT INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA? THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS WE’RE GOING TO IRON OUT HERE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. MONDAY NIGHT, BY THE WAY, BEHIND THAT STORM SYSTEM, WE’VE GOT SOME SHOWERS HERE AND, UH, COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL DROP BACK INTO THE MID IN THE UPPER 60S. BY THE WAY, THAT GAME WILL BE RIGHT HERE ON WESH TWO AS THE PLAYOFFS KICK ON OFF. SO IMPACT DAY FRIDAY DRYING OUT SATURDAY. SECOND HALF OF THE DAY ON SUNDAY. WET SOUTH, DRY UP NORTH. ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM COMES IN MONDAY NIGHT AND TUE Advertisement Showers and storms to move in late Friday into early Saturday morning.

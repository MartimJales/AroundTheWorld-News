    "text": "Winter storm provides perfect snow, snowmobilers say MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Dane County snowmobilers hit the trails for the first time in 2024, and they call this week’s snowfall the perfect winter storm for trail riding. The Dane County Snowmobile Club puts in hours of volunteer work to make sure the trails are ready when the first big winter storm hits southern Wisconsin. ”Our rule of thumb is six inches of snow and 32 degrees,” Dane County Council of Snowmobile Clubs Director Sam Landes said. “It’s as perfect as I’ve seen it in a long time because you get the wet, heavy snow that you can now pack down. We got a couple of inches blowing last night, and the guys were all out padding. So they’re all out smoothing stuff.” Sam rides snowmobiles with his family. On Saturday, he hit the trails for the first time of the year with his son Chad Landes and his granddaughters. ”It feels great. It’s almost like a kid waiting for a snow day,” Chad said. ”It’s a different kind of way to explore the state of Wisconsin like you’ve not been able to see before.” Sam said safety is the most important thing for snowmobilers to think about. He said anyone born after 1985 needs to get certified, people should stay on marked trails and check trail conditions before heading out. ”Make sure you understand those winds are going to be high so you want to make sure you’re playing it safe. You have your snowmobile safety,” he said. “So, you want to have all that stuff, and be safe, and realize that you could come up with something that you might have to turn around and go a different direction on. So, you want to just be certain you’re careful and safe.” There are 605 snowmobile clubs in Wisconsin, and 15 of the clubs are in Dane County.

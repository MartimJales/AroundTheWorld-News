    "text": "MOUNT LAUREL, NJ â€” After not seeing more than one inch of snow since January 2022, were you happy to wake up to the white stuff on the ground this morning? While it wasn't enough for a day of sledding, the snow and wintry mix falling from the sky have forced closures in Mount Laurel on Tuesday. Mount Laurel's municipal building and offices are closed on Tuesday, January 16 due to the inclement weather. Offices will re-open on Wednesday at 8AM. Due to the snow, trash collection is expected to take longer than normal and will result in some neighborhoods not having their garbage collected today, according to a post on the Township's Facebook page. Those who do not have their trash picked up are asked to leave it out, as anything not collected on Tuesday will be retrieved first thing on Wednesday. All schools in the Mount Laurel School District and Lenape Regional High School District, including Lenape High School, are closed on Tuesday. Road work that was slated to begin on Hartford Road this week is being delayed due to wet weather in the forecast. In addition, construction work on Hartford Road that was scheduled to start on January 16 has been pushed back and is now expected to begin on Monday, January 22.

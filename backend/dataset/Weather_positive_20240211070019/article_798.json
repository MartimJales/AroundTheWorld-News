    "text": "BOISE, Idaho — Prepare for the plows! After some serious snow, [ACHD has started moving its snow plows from main roads into neighborhood streets](/article/news/local/local-achd-to-start-plowing-on-residential-streets/277-7a0a6e5e-8d93-4915-93e8-ae1301bc0014). ACHD remains in 24-hour operations, and with snow expected to stick around. the district is clearing more than just their [top priorities](/article/news/local/local-how-achd-prioritizes-which-roads-to-plow-first-when-snow-falls/277-3336ec07-4bf9-4357-89fa-1bf0600393ae#%3A~%3Atext=ACHD%20has%20three%20priority%20levels,hospitals,%20fire%20stations%20and%20schools.) - which are main roads, roads with inclines, and areas around schools, hospitals, and fire stations. The district moved its winter operations into residential areas Sunday night, as they clear snow on more than 3,000 lane miles of residential streets throughout Ada County. KTVB rode along in an ACHD snow plow as it cleared neighborhoods in Boise's North End Monday morning. Maneuvering through the narrow neighborhoods is a change of pace for the plows - and ACHD general equipment operator (GEO) Sean Collins. \"It's really fun, it's nerve-wracking at first,\" Collins said. \"Because you're always worried about hitting stuff, you don't want to fling snow, and you don't want to hit cars. So, everything is a really slow pace. And then you've got to know where you need to push the snow, because everything has to go to the curb.\" As they plow the snowy streets, there are a few things you can do to make snow plow drivers' lives a little easier - including avoiding shoveling snow into the roads, keeping storm drains clear, and parking off-street if possible. \"Down here [in the North End], try and get your car parked as close to the curb as possible either before the storm or after the storm,\" Collins said. \"I know people clear around their cars and everything, but the moment I come back through, it's just going to get pushed right into their car. So, the best thing to do if you're going to shovel around your car to help clear out the road - you need to try and get it shoveled up onto your yard.\" ACHD said it could take some time to clear all the residential streets in the county, [depending on when the weather warms up](/weather/).

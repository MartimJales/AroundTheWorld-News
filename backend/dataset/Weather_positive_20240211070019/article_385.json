    "text": "DJ Horne scored a game-high 27 points, helped by six 3-pointers, as visiting North Carolina State held off Louisville to capture an 89-83 victory on Saturday in Louisville, Ky. DJ Burns Jr. and Casey Morsell added 13 points apiece for the Wolfpack (12-4, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), while Michael O’Connell added 11 points. Mohamed Diarra tallied 7 points and 11 rebounds for NC State, which has won five of its past six games. Mike James led Louisville (6-10, 1-4) with 20 points, followed by 15 points from Curtis Williams. Ty-Laur Johnson chipped in 14 and Brandon Huntley-Hatfield tallied 13 points and 10 boards. Facing a nine-point halftime deficit, Louisville put together a 17-8 run to start the second half, knotting the score at 52 at the 12:33 mark. A Williams 3-pointer with 9:55 left tied the score at 58, before a 10-4 Wolfpack run that pushed the NC State lead to six. A pair of Johnson free throws cut the Louisville deficit to four with 7:26 left. NC State answered with a 7-0 run that was punctuated by a Horne layup, pushing the Wolfpack lead back to double digits. NC State took an 83-69 lead, its largest of the second half with 2:18 left, before an 11-0 Louisville run cut the deficit to three points with 52 seconds left. Horne then converted an and-one, giving NC State an 86-80 lead that Skyy Clark answered with triple for Louisville, cutting the lead in half with 22 seconds left.

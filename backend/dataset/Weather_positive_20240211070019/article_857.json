    "text": "Videos by OutKick\nBuffalo Bills fans put on a show Monday against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThe game was supposed to be played Sunday but was pushed to Monday because of the\nweather. That led to a lot of outrage from fans, and another absolutely classic troll job on X from with my tried and true D-Day shtick.\nThe game finally kicked off late Monday afternoon, and it ended with a 31-17 win for\nBuffalo over Pittsburgh.\nIt was also absolute scenes at Highmark Stadium as the game unfolded. While people shoved out the walkways, there was still plenty of snow in the stands and fans put it to great use.\nThe Buffalo Bills faithful threw snow up into the air and at each other following a touchdown catch from Dawson Knox.\nWatch the truly beautiful scene unfold below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\nBuffalo Bills fans soak up snow atmosphere.\nBuffalo Bills fans were made for the snow and snow was made for Buffalo Bills fans. Bills supporters are a different breed.\nThe\nBills Mafia loves to get loaded on booze and jump through burning tables. There was never a chance the snow would slow them down.\nNot only did it not slow fans down, but it led to some truly epic scenes. Can you believe there are people who can watch videos like these from Buffalo and not immediately fall in love with football?\nNext up for the Bills is the Kansas City Chiefs. For the sake of the content game, I hope thereâ€™s plenty of snow on the ground. Monday in Buffalo was truly a thing of majestic beauty, and fans around the country would love to see it again.",

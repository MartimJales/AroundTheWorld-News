    "text": "Though the weather outside may be frightful, the wrestling quad at Tri-Center was so delightful for Riverside, who went 3-0 at Thursday's wrestling quad.\nRiverside finished on top of the rest of the crew, going 3-0 through the quad as they beat ACGC in their first duel 42-37, dominated Western Iowa Conference foe Tri-Center 61-12, then capped off the evening with a 61-17 victory over Woodbine.\n\"The kids wrestled very well, I was very happy with how we came out and fought,\" Bulldogs coach Casey Conover said. \"We still have some kids battling some injuries so it was especially great to see some of the younger kids step up and wrestle well. This month is going to be a grind. We still need to get better physically and mentally. We just need to keep working on the small things, and we'll keep getting better.\"\nRiverside’s Kingston Carrigan (106), Davis Bramman (113), Jack Branan (138), Jaxon Gordon (144), Taven Moore (150), Jett Rose (157), and A.C. Roller (165) were all winners for Riverside against ACGC.\nPeople are also reading…\nCarrigan, Bramman, Kellen Oliver (120), Bradyn Comstock (126), Jack Branan (132), Gordon, Moore, Rose, Roller, Gaven Hackett (175), and Jackson Allen (190) were all winners against Tri-Center.\nRose, Moore, Roller, Hackett, Allen, Carrington, Bramman, Oliver, Branan, Rex Shanno (138), and Gordon all earned victories against Woodbine.\nRose, who was one of the six Bulldog wrestlers who went 3-0 on the evening, was especially pleased to have a solid night after battling an injury to start the season, and now looks to build momentum as sectionals and districts draw closer.\n\"Starting the season off injured is always tough, but it just feels good to be back on the mat,\" Rose said. \"The coaches have been talking to us about how January is going to be a grind, but we're looking forward to it. Hopefully, it will help us out in February, I want to get past the sectionals this time and make my way to state.\"\nTri-Center went 1-2 in the evening as they won by a tie-breaker over Woodbine 37-36 in their first duel, then fell to Riverside in their second duel, and then lost 59-17 to ACGC.\nTucker Olsen (106), Gryphen McDermott (120), Noah Goodwin (132), Brant Freeberg (138), Titus Humbert (144), Charlie Morse (190), and Athan Chessmore (215) were the victors for TC in the win over Woodbine.\nFreeberg was one of two Trojans to go 3-0 on the night after pinning two opponents and winning by a major decision in his third match. Freeberg looks to battle through his junior year, hoping it will lead to a second straight trip to state soon.\n\"All three were good matches and I just worked on everything I knew how to do and polish myself,\" Freeberg said. \"Got the pin in those first two matches, but the final kid was really solid and didn't let himself get turned, so I just had to pile up the points. We have a few more duels, so I'm hoping to get more duel wins and get back to the Wells Fargo Arena.\"\nFreeberg and Chessmore collected the only two victories against Riverside.\nChessmore also went 3-0 for TC and has some big goals of his own. After pinning all three of his opponents in this quad, he looks to ride this momentum in the upcoming meets and hopes to join some of his teammates in Des Moines later.\n\"All three guys were pretty tough, but I just kept working positions and moves to get the pins,\" Chessmore said. \"I've been working on a lot of different things, trying to improve myself to be the best come districts. Hopefully, that results in a lot more wins and a trip to state.\"\nAlong with Freeberg and Chessmore, Tucker Olsen (106) got a win in the ACGC duel.\nWoodbine went 0-3 at this quad, and ACGC went 2-1 on the night.\nTri-Center will wrestle again on Saturday at the Griswold Tournament starting at 10 a.m. Riverside will wrestle again on Tuesday in a triangular at Underwood starting at 5:30 p.m.",

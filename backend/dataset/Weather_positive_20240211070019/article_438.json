    "text": "How did Taylor Swift and Co. [weather the kick-off temperatures](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/nfl/what-were-the-coldest-games-in-nfl-history-heres-a-list-as-the-postseason-begins/) of minus-4 degrees with a wind chill of minus-26 degrees at Arrowhead Stadium? They simply shook it off -- \"swag surfin'\" style. As the Kansas City Chiefs [closed a 26-7 wild-card win](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/nfl/5-winners-losers-from-chiefs-26-7-win-vs-dolphins-on-peacock/) over the [Miami Dolphins](https://www.nbcmiami.com/tag/miami-dolphins/) Saturday night, the broadcast on Peacock panned to Swift in a luxury suite. Swift, [sporting a custom Travis Kelce jacket](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/taylor-swift-attends-frigid-chiefs-playoff-game-wearing-custom-travis-kelce-jacket/), could be seen \"swag surfin'\" with fans. Get South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. [Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.] Based off the \"Fast Life Yungstaz\" song of the same name, Swift was also dancing with Donna Kelce, mother of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce whom the pop star has a relationship with. It was a solid night for Kelce on the field, as he caught seven passes for 71 yards in the win despite the frigid temperature where the football felt more like a rock. Will Swift attend Kansas City's next game? It could depend on the result between the No. 2 Buffalo Bills and No. 7 Pittsburgh Steelers [on Monday](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/nfl/bills-steelers-playoff-game-postponed-to-monday-due-to-weather-conditions/). NFL If the Bills win, the Chiefs will have to go to Buffalo for the divisional round. If the Steelers pull off the upset, Kansas City will host the No. 4 [Houston Texans](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/sports/nfl/winners-and-losers-from-texans-dominant-playoff-win-over-browns/).",

    "text": "COWETA, Okla. — Water, snacks and cots can be found inside CrossPoint Baptist Church in Coweta. Friday night the church opened its doors as a warming shelter. “We wanted to give a warm place through this dangerous weather, to give them a place that they can come to, to have a warm meal, to have a warm bed,” said Brett Wheeler, the pastor at CrossPoint Baptist Church. We asked Wheeler why they became a warming shelter. “The answer would really be with one word and that’s God, to know that God put it on our heart to be obedient to him,” Wheeler said. CrossPoint Baptist Church partnered with Wagoner County Emergency Management (WCEM) for the shelter. The church provides volunteers and space and WCEM provides the supplies. “We have all the slots filled for 24 hours of volunteers here to help and just to be here and show Jesus to people that need the love during this cold season,” Wheeler said. Wheeler said they just want to be able to help those in need. “It breaks your heart to know that there’s people out there shivering in cold during this time and have nothing,” Wheeler said. Matt Rose with WCEM said over these next couple days, they will be on the lookout for stranded motorists, people struggling with homelessness and people without power. “We were just really happy that Pastor Wheeler and CrossPoint Baptist Church were able to step up and provide that warming shelter,” Rose said. We asked Rose what their plans are if the weather gets any worse. “For the citizens it’s obviously the warming shelters, of course as this system moves in tomorrow, throughout the weekend, you know our main goal will then focus onto the roadways,” Rose said. CrossPoint Baptist Church will be open through Monday but plans to stay open as long as there is a need.",

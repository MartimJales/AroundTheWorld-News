    "text": "Remember, “if you want to see God laugh, tell him your plan!” Things do change, so plan accordingly. The National Taxpayer Union estimates that 60% of property in the U.S. is over-assessed. Panattoni Development said it will invest $155 million in 580 South, which is a joint venture between Panattoni and Clarion Partners of New York City. A slider bar will be the all-star at your Super Bowl party. There’s been some recent changes within one of Carson’s favorite Italian restaurants that include not only some interior refresh, but personnel changes as well. Both major political parties would love to score a “victory” for their side in tax law changes to gain potential votes. The lack of new retail construction and continued tenant demand for shop space in Reno-Sparks led to average retail vacancy of just over 4 percent at year’s end. It is important that you remember that your location will also be a large factor in the success of the sale of your property when you are ready to move on. Jordan River and Emilee Riggin are in the process of rebranding Hot Spot Yoga to Grassroots Yoga Center in hopes of growing business. Pure Development found it’s quite a different process to find — and clear — land in the Silver State. This is truly a simple, easy and delicious recipe. It satisfies the home-cooked, hardy comfort meal that we all just crave sometimes. Managers of Carson, Storey, Lyon, Douglas and Mineral counties discussed economic strengths and weaknesses of their respective areas and described a common synergy. This works best when the stock market isn’t in wild gyrations and is fairly stable. Find the facts for yourself and make sure the property works for you in the manner in which you intended it to.

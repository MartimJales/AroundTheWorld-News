    "text": "Was there any doubt that Bills Mafia would answer the call?\nThe Buffalo Bills announced they were seeking extra hands to help shovel snow at Highmark Stadium ahead of their playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . The team was offering $20 an hour, along with complimentary food and breaks \"in a comfortable warm area,\" to prospective snow shovelers.\nThat was before the postseason contest, originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, got postponed on Saturday due to public safety concerns amid an ongoing winter weather emergency in western New York.\nCurrent scene at Highmark Stadium.\nStay safe tonight, Bills Mafia. ❄️ pic.twitter.com/FSJvNht1ri\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 13, 2024 Bills stadium at 1p ET today — the original kickoff of the game, before it moved to tomorrow at 4:30p ET (for now). pic.twitter.com/f500YhwsLH\n— Evan Abrams (@EvanHAbrams) January 14, 2024 The heavy snow and high winds caused the game to be moved to Monday at 4:30 p.m. ET .\nWhile the snow was still coming down early Sunday, clean-up efforts were underway at the Orchard Park, New York, NFL stadium. And a member of Bills Mafia was helping out in a very Bills Mafia fashion .",

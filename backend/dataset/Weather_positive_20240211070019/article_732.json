    "text": "Winter weather doesn’t stop City of Lewisburg’s MLK Day parade LEWISBURG, [W.Va](http://w.va/). (WVVA) - Monday morning, neither bitter wind nor blowing snow stopped folks from converging on the courthouse in Lewisburg for the city’s annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade. “They’ve been doing this for 20 years, and there’s so many fine people that show up here,” shared Larry Davis, a member of the Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Planning Committee. “It’s the highlight of my year! And it comes right near the first.” For some, this parade is about bringing people together and celebrating the power of love. “You can see there’s a lot of young people, a lot of kids here, people of all different races,” explained Greenbrier native Kayla Reed. “...Even though we’re a little smaller in number this year, and I think it’s because of the storm and the weather, but still like showing and making sure that it’s a priority that we’re here no matter what.” For others, the event is a spotlight on the continual fight against racial inequality and the effort to promote the belief, in Dr. King’s words, “that all people be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.” “I come out every year, not just to show my love for Dr. King, but to advocate for, you know, racial justice,” shared Lewisburg resident Naomi Cohen. Cohen tells WVVA she has been a part of the parade in Lewisburg for decades but has actually been a part of making change for much longer. “I first started advocating for racial justice when I was in high school during the sit-ins at the Woolworth counters. I was in New York. So, yeah, I’ve been doing this not just since 2002, but since probably 1962.” While everyone has their personal connections to the parade, they can all agree their participation each January is a moment to honor the life and legacy of MLK, and a promise to continue the movement he started nearly 70 years ago. Following their march up West Washington Street, parade members enjoyed a lunch program at the United Methodist Church in Lewisburg. Copyright 2024 WVVA. All rights reserved.",

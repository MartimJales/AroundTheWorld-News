    "text": "There are two types of people in this world: People who like snow, and people who don’t. I fall along with the crowd of people that love the cold weather, thus love to see snowflakes drifting down from the sky during wintertime. The other group of people absolutely hate everything about snow and frigid temperatures, and they even have a nickname: “Florida residents.” I’m not sure how you could possibly hate snow. As long as you are prepared for it (and by that I mean rush to the grocery the day before to buy milk, eggs, and bread), looking out the window at a winter wonderland should be a very relaxing experience. And there’s no denying the fact that the river otter in this video below loves the snow. Based on how the small animal acts in the footage, it’s been waiting for a snow day for its entire life. This clip comes out of Tennessee, which if you didn’t know, is home to river otters (snow-loving river otters to be specific). Someone that lives on Old Hickory Lake looked down towards their dock as [historic amounts of snow fell in Tennessee](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2024/01/15/i-can-keep-an-ice-cream-cone-in-my-pocket-nashville-weather-reporter-finds-silver-lining-reporting-on-winter-storm-heather/), and saw that an otter was utilizing it in order to live its best life. It appears that the otter came out of the water and onto what appears to be a jet ski dock, and it was there where it was able to roll around on the freshly fallen snow. With how it was tossing and turning on its back, it might have unintentionally made a few “snow otters.” I’m not sure I’ve ever seen an animal enjoy the snow as much as this otter. If I had to pick one that rivaled it, we did recently see a [rescued bear enjoy the frozen precipitation](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2024/01/13/rescued-brown-bear-has-time-of-its-life-rolling-around-in-freshly-fallen-snow/) up in New York. I think I’d still stick with the otter in the video below though:",

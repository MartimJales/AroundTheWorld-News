    "text": "Rio Bravo offering warm place for residents to stay LAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - Like any other community, Rio Bravo and El Cenizo residents are going to need help getting through these freezing temperatures. Because of that need, officials in Rio Bravo will be providing them with a warm place to stay for the night. Rio Bravo Mayor Pro Tempore Amanda Aguero shared details for some of those plans. “The city of Rio Bravo, my staff, and the fire department are ready to assist. The American Red Cross has so kindly provided us with these things that are helpful for our community residents. We want them to have a piece of mind and we are ready to assist front and center to the community’s needs,” Aguero told us. Aguero added, “Give or take we are ready for 41 people. If in case we need more assistance, we are prepared. My staff has been making calls and has been able to have our ducks in a row. In case we need more assistance, we are ready. Our numbers are up online. Tomorrow we will be closed because we are more focused that we are out there and that our residents are being taken care of.” Community members who need transportation to the nearest shelter can call 956-790-9500.

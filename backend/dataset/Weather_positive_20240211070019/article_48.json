    "text": "Thursday, January 11th 2024, 6:43 pm The citizens of Tulsa responded to a plea for warm clothing by the Day Center, which was busy with people dropping off donations Thursday. “And the community has come out in force, and it's so amazing to have such blessings come in non-stop,” said Josh Sanders, with the Day Center. The need is certain with people sleeping outside, so teams will mobilize Friday to find people and urge them to take shelter. For those who refuse, supplies will be offered to help them survive. “If they are willing to go into shelter, we’re helping them pack up, find what shelter meets their needs, if they have animals, trying to match them with shelter that allows animals, or families, things like that,” Laura Evanoff, the Deputy Director of Housing Solutions, said. The shelters also need to buy supplies that aren’t being donated, so they’re always welcoming cash donations. Housing Solutions encourages people worried about people they see outside to call 911 if it’s an emergency and otherwise let them know through a form that will go to an outreach team. [Click here](https://www.housingsolutionstulsa.org/assistance-request/) to find that form. Tulsa Dream Center is opening a shelter on Saturday that accepts pets. They are located at 4122 W 55th Pl, Tulsa. January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024 January 11th, 2024",

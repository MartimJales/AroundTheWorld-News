    "text": "For Lake Effect Snow in Genesee & Wyoming Counties through 10 AM Tuesday through 7 PM Thursday. Travel may be difficult in these areas. Crews continue to work to clear snow in and around the stadium in Orchard Park as the Buffalo Bills prepare to host a playoff game Monday under unusual circumstances. The team was set to host the Pittsburgh Steelers in an AFC wild-card playoff game Sunday afternoon, but severe winter weather across Western New York prompted a travel ban, a state of emergency and [ultimately a postponement.](https://13wham.com/news/local/bills-steelers-playoff-game-postponed-to-monday-due-to-winter-storm#) The game is set to kick off at 4:30 p.m. Monday, setting up an extremely rare weekday NFL playoff game â€” albeit on Martin Luther King Day, a federal holiday. MORE: [ Local fans react to Bills vs. Steelers game rescheduled to Monday due to winter storm](https://13wham.com/news/local/bills-vs-steelers-game-rescheduled-to-monday-due-to-winter-storm-gets-mixed-reactions#) | [Winter weather conditions disrupt travel in Rochester](https://13wham.com/news/local/winter-weather-conditions-disrupt-20-of-flights-in-rochester#) The Bills [brought in fans to shovel the stadium](https://13wham.com/newsletter-daily/bills-tell-snow-shovelers-to-abide-by-travel-bans-in-place#) starting at midnight, with work continuing through the morning. Plows are working to move snow in parking lots outside the stadium as well. Travel restrictions have been lifted for most of Western New York, including Orchard Park, though a ban remains in effect in Lackawanna, Cheektowaga and Lancaster. Parking lots at the stadium open at 12:30 p.m., with gates to the stadium opening at 2:30 ahead of the 4:30 kickoff. The Bills are offering a free shuttle bus from McKinely Mall in Hamburg to the stadium, about 2 miles away. The No. 2 seed Bills (11-6) are 10-point favorites against the No. 7 seed Steelers (10-7). Bills fans who spoke to 13WHAM outside the stadium Monday morning were confident. \"I don't even think it's going to be close,\" Bills fan Adam Baghi said. \"The Bills are probably going to run up the score on the Steelers too.\" \"I'm pumped up,\" Bills fan Kevin Chang said. \"I'm fired up. I've been waiting for this all year. Let's get it, boys. Let's go!\" If the Bills win, they will advance to host the No. 3 seed Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round Sunday.

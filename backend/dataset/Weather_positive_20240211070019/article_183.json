    "text": "The snow is flying and that means it’s officially time to embrace our Great Milwaukee Winter. Fortunately, the folks at\nLost Whale, 2151 S. Kinnickinnic Ave., have our best interests at heart.\nThat’s because – for one day only – they’re bringing in a blast of warm San Diego sunshine, plus a menu of tiki-inspired drinks, from the folks at\nSwan Bar.\nThis very special West Coast Takeover takes place on Sunday, Jan. 14 from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. (doors open at 3:30 p.m.) and will feature four very special cocktails created just for the occasion.\n“Swan Bar is a fun cocktail bar in San Diego that mirrors Lost Whale, not only in their silly shenanigans but in their well-balanced, creative cocktails too!,” notes Lost Whale General Manager, Maria Westphal, noting that Beverage Director Pete Shea is the mastermind behind the four tiki-inspired cocktails that will be served during the event.\nIn addition to Lost Whale’s usual house cocktails, guests can look forward to Swan Bar quaffs like:\n- Drugstore Cowboy: Zacapa No. 23 Rum, Mr. Black Coffee Liqueur, Cynar Amaro, Pineapple, and Lime\n- Big Iron: George Dickel 8yr Bourbon, Passionfruit, Orgeat, Pineapple, Lemon, Tobacco Bitters, and Orange Bitters\n- F*ckin’ wu: Tanqueray, Lustau Fino Sherry, Honeydew, Cantelope, and Lime\n- Spaghetti Western: George Dickel 8yr Bourbon and secret “spaghetti syrup” (Don’t worry, no spaghetti was harmed in the making of this spaghetti-free syrup).\nBut that’s not all. The Packers’ game will be playing (yes, you should cheer them on!) and Lost Whale will be hosting a complimentary chili bar to keep your insides all toasty warm. Bonus: If you get there early, you can enjoy Lost Whale’s half-off happy hour specials until 6 p.m.\nLori is an avid cook whose accrual of condiments and spices is rivaled only by her cookbook collection. Her passion for the culinary industry was birthed while balancing A&W root beer mugs as a teenage carhop, fed by insatiable curiosity and fueled by the people whose stories entwine with each and every dish. She’s had the privilege of chronicling these tales via numerous media, including OnMilwaukee and in her book “Milwaukee Food.” Her work has garnered journalism awards from entities including the Milwaukee Press Club.\nWhen she’s not eating, photographing food, writing or recording the FoodCrush podcast, you’ll find Lori seeking out adventures with her husband Paul, traveling, cooking, reading, learning, snuggling with her cats and looking for ways to make a difference.\nGet all the daily headlines in your inbox\nSign up for our newsletter",

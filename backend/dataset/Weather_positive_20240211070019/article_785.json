    "text": "This week, the Met Office issued a cold weather warning, with bracing temperatures as low as –10 °C set to hit the UK.\nWith temperatures predicted to be even lower than Greenland in some parts of the UK,\nBensons for Beds has revealed why taking inspiration from such colder climes may be the solution to keeping your bedroom warm on a budget this week.\nResiding in certain areas of Canada, Greenland, and the Arctic, the Inuits have a method of keeping warm that has worked for thousands of years: igloos. Inside the igloo, there’s a high platform on which the inhabitants sleep. As heat rises, it makes sense to sleep on a high platform.\nBensons for Beds brand manager, Rachel Marshall, says: “We can gain inspiration from some of the strategies to keep our houses warm, such as sleeping higher up. As heated air is thinner than colder air, it makes sense that it naturally rises. Therefore, kids sleeping on top of a bunk bed or in a high or\nmidsleeper bed could feel the benefits.\nSurprisingly, there is also a hole or vent in the igloo, which is needed to allow fresh air in and the water vapour caused by breathing out. The vent helps the interior remain dry. This same logic should be applied to the vents in your home.\nRachel adds: “It may be tempting to close any vents leading to the outside of your home but it’s important not to do this.\n“Air vents are in your home for a reason. They’ve been designed to allow air to flow through your home and also to prevent a buildup of humidity. Excess humidity can lead to mould, which then can lead to health problems that affect our sleep.”\nResearch suggests that\nmould in the bedroom can lead to a host of sleep issues, such as insomnia and snoring, while allergic rhinitis can also lead to restlessness and even sleep apnea.\nThe key behind igloos is insulation so focus on creating a cosy, well-insulated environment in your bedroom without having to turn the heating up. One cost-effective solution is to invest in an all-season duvet. Products such as the\nSlumberland 3-in-1 duvet contain a 4.5 tog for warmer nights, a 9 tog for cooler nights, or can be combined to create a 13.5 tog for the coldest of nights.\nRachel concludes: “Use curtains to your advantage by keeping them open during the day to let the sun provide natural warmth before closing them at night to insulate the room. Block out any pesky draughts with cost-effective draft stoppers made from towels or bundled up socks.”\nFor more tips on\nkeeping warm on a budget, visit the Bensons for Beds Sleep Hub.",

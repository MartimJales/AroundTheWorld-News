    "text": "On Saturday night, the [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.chiefs.com/) players were prepared for the extremely cold weather. It was predicted that the Chiefs playoff matchup with Miami would be among the coldest in NFL history, with an anticipated two-degree temperature and a windchill of -30 degrees. Allen Wright, the equipment director for Kansas City, [ told People](https://people.com/how-kansas-city-chiefs-prepare-for-cold-playoff-game-8425962) that the team would be use a range of equipment to combat it and stay warm for the game. Wetsuits, thermal socks, heated benches, “long” underwear, and even infrared sideline heaters are among this equipment’s offerings. Wright continued by saying that he gives the wetsuits to each member of the team. Only half of the squad decides to accept them, though. He went on to say that tight end [Travis Kelce](https://blacksportsonline.com/tag/travis-kelce/) is one guy who won’t be dressing very differently for the game. “So he’s a guy that doesn’t really change much on what he wears,” Wright said of Kelce. “He’s one that believes on staying warm on the sideline and then going out there for the 5, 6, 8 minutes, whatever an offensive drive is, then come back over and get warm when he comes off the field.” Although the Dolphins vs. Chiefs game is chilly, it won’t be the coldest NFL game ever played. That distinction goes to the 1967 NFL Championship game between the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys, which took place in negative -13 degree weather with a negative -48 wind chill. In the AFC Wild Card Game against the Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice scored the first touchdown for the team with an 11-yard pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes.",

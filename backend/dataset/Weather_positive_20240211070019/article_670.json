    "text": "On Monday morning, Mumbaikars woke up to pleasant weather and clear skies with the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) touching 73 in the city. While the maximum temperature floated over 30 degrees, the minimum dropped to 18.7 degrees on Sunday night, indicating a stark fall from Saturday. According to scientists and weather experts, Mumbai is experiencing good air quality owing to the northerlies that arrived on Sunday.\nData from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that while the overall AQI stood at 73 — which falls in the satisfactory category — five of the city’s 19 recording stations registered an AQI below 50, which is categorised as ‘good’. The best air quality was observed in Worli where the AQI stood at 34 followed by Bhandup’s Khindipada (44) and Borivali and Vile Parle (49). At 105, the worst AQI was registered in Malad.\nResponding to questions, scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed the improvement in air quality to changing wind directions and influx of the northerlies.\n“Last week,\nMumbai was reeling under high temperatures owing to the prominent Southeasterly winds, which are moist in nature. However, since Sunday, we have had the northerly wind component which has resulted in the improvement of air quality. The change in wind direction is largely responsible for the good AQI,” Sushma Nair from IMD Mumbai told the Indian Express.\nUnlike last winter, Mumbai has been experiencing moderate air quality for a prolonged period this winter, a season which is typically associated with burgeoning AQI levels.\nSenior scientist and project director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecast and Research (SAFAR), Gufran Beig, attributed the good air quality to higher wind speeds and velocity.\nBeig said, “This year, the surface winds are relatively high. Currently, we are in an El Nino year. This phenomenon escalates the wind speed in the western region. This is the exact opposite of last year, which was the La Nina year. Therefore, the city is experiencing relatively good air quality this season.”\nAccording to IMD scientists, the northerlies are responsible for the declining minimum temperatures apart from improving the air quality.\nAmid higher minimum temperatures, which hovered around 23 degrees until Sunday, minimum temperatures dropped significantly on Monday morning with the IMD’s Santacruz observatory recording a minimum temperature of 18.7 degrees.\n“Owing to the northerlies, the temperatures will continue to oscillate between 30-31 degrees for the next couple of days, before a gradual decline. However, there won’t be a very sharp fall in temperatures,” added Nair.",

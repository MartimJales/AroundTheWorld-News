    "text": "KENT COUNTY, Mich. — The [Kent County Sheriff's Office](https://www.accesskent.com/Sheriff/) shared tips on emergency preparedness ahead of the winter storm heading for West Michigan. The [National Weather Service (NWS) in Grand Rapids](https://www.weather.gov/grr/) is forecasting heavy snow and strong wind gusts of 30 to 55 mph along with heavy snow causing blowing and drifting, whiteout conditions, power outages, and hazardous travel conditions. Kent County Emergency Management is encouraging everyone to prepare ahead of the storm. Before: 1: Consider changing travel plans - Listen to travel advisories by the [National Weather Service](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcHJvdGVjdC11c2IubWltZWNhc3QuY29tL3MvT0s0WUN5cFd3UUhvbXY1aU1ienVBP2RvbWFpbj13ZWF0aGVyLmdvdi8iLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjQwMTExLjg4Mzk3ODYxIn0.FU8OxKLlzAo2IUWS_nVgl18cm4vGFadGBzHS42d6bYo/s/2968836649/br/234822200330-l) - Traveling in the predicated conditions is dangerous and not recommended. If you travel on Friday, arrive at your destination early and plan to stay until the roads are clear and conditions improve - Carry an [emergency supply kit](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcHJvdGVjdC11c2IubWltZWNhc3QuY29tL3MvWlA3VkN6cWc2VnVxTmxvaWc0azFsP2RvbWFpbj1yZWFkeS5nb3YiLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjQwMTExLjg4Mzk3ODYxIn0.-Ug30F2OnOzVwYieiA4MUdACgHHtu-5WDLwd1N5MI1k/s/2968836649/br/234822200330-l)in your vehicle with essential items such as salt, sand, a shovel, food and blankets if you need to travel - When traveling, let someone know your destination, route and expected arrival time 2: Gather supplies - Water— one gallon per person per day - Food — supply of nonperishable, easy-to-prepare food - Blankets and warm clothing - Medications and medical items (hearing aids with extra batteries, glasses, contact lenses, saline solution, syringes, canes, etc.) - Identify a safe alternative heat source and supply of fuel in the event of a power outage - Pet supplies - Flashlight and extra batteries - Charge all cellphones, laptops, and other devices that use rechargeable batteries - Ensure you have a backup power source in case of long-term power outages if you require oxygen - A list of family and emergency contact information 3: Prepare your home - Open kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Remember to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals up out of the reach of children - To prevent frozen pipes allow water to drip from faucets served by exposed piping - Keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night - If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat on in your home, set to a temperature no lower than 55° F. - Due to the high winds, you should identify items outside your home you will need to tie down or put away so that they don't blow away or fly through a window. - Also, identify an interior room of your house, such as a basement or interior bathroom, or another location that you can take shelter in during high wind warnings if needed During: 1: Going out - Adhere to all travel advisories. Travel will be very difficult to impossible during the storm. Widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility - Stay inside during the storm. If you must go outside, wear several layers of lightweight clothing, a hat and gloves to prevent loss of body heat. Cover your mouth to protect your lungs - If you need to go outside, walk like a penguin (slowly and take short steps). Keep feet about shoulder width apart when walking on icy or snow-covered areas 2: Take care of pets - Bring your companion animals indoors. - Create a place where your other animals can be comfortable in severe winter weather.

Check on your animals frequently to make sure that their access to food and water is not blocked by snow drifts, ice or other obstacles 3: Power outages and down power lines - Stay at least 25 feet away from downed power lines - Call or text 9-1-1 and your local power company to report any downed line 4: Generators - If using a generator, make sure it is running outside your home and never use gasoline-powered devices inside the home. Carbon monoxide is created by these devices and dangerous levels can be fatal - Generators and fuel should always be used outdoors and at least 20 feet away from windows, doors and attached garages - Always connect the generator to appliances with heavy-duty extension cords - Let the generator cool before refueling. Fuel spilled on hot engine parts can ignite 5: Check on friends and loved ones - Periodically call or text friends, family and vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those with disabilities to check on their wellbeing 6: Look for warming centers near you - It is advised you do not travel during the storm; however, in the event that you need warmth or shelter you may find a warming center near you. You can find information on warming centers in West Michigan [here](/article/news/local/west-michigan-warming-centers/69-346361c9-4b30-43fe-8ed3-7b80cece6403) After: 1: Shovel smart - Avoid over-exerting yourself in the cold - Follow your doctor’s advice about shoveling snow or other hard work in the cold - Don't eat a large meal or drink alcohol to avoid extra stress on your heart - Be cautious as wet snow can be twice as heavy - Warm up your muscles and take it slow - Push the snow rather than lifting it. If you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel - Take frequent breaks - do not work to the point of exhaustion - Stop shoveling immediately and call 9-1-1 if you are experiencing any signs of a heart attack 2: Prevent hypothermia and frostbite [Know the signs of frostbite and hypothermia](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDYsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNkYy5nb3YvZGlzYXN0ZXJzL3dpbnRlci9zdGF5c2FmZS9oeXBvdGhlcm1pYS5odG1sIiwiYnVsbGV0aW5faWQiOiIyMDI0MDExMS44ODM5Nzg2MSJ9.qgRRc1fz5Y5RmaVA8MTjgEAtP3FOt19iK-Ib3N9-6Js/s/2968836649/br/234822200330-l) - Layer up: Inner Layer, wear fabrics that will hold more body heat and don’t absorb moisture. Wool, silk, or polypropylene will hold more body heat than cotton. Insulation Layer, an insulation layer will help you retain heat by trapping air close to your body. Natural fibers, like wool, goose down, or a fleece work best. Outer Layer, the outermost layer helps protect you from wind, rain, and snow. It should be tightly woven, and preferably water and wind resistant, to reduce loss of body heat 3: Returning home after a power outage - Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible. First use perishable food from the refrigerator. An unopened refrigerator will keep foods cold for about 4 hours and a full freezer will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours - When in doubt throw it out. Food that has been exposed to temperatures greater than 40 degrees for two (2) hours or more should be destroyed - If water pipes are frozen, do not use open flames, torches or welders to thaw them as this presents a fire risk. To safely thaw pipes, open cabinets to allow ambient heat or utilize a hair dryer on a high setting.

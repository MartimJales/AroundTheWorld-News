    "text": "Was there any doubt that Bills Mafia would answer the call?\nThe\n[Buffalo Bills](/tag/buffalo-bills) announced they were [seeking extra hands to help shovel snow at Highmark Stadium](/news/sports/nfl/buffalo-bills-seeking-snow-shovelers-ahead-of-playoff-game-on-saturday) ahead of their [playoff game](/tag/nfl-playoffs) against the [Pittsburgh Steelers](/tag/pittsburgh-steelers). The team was offering $20 an hour, along with complimentary food and breaks \"in a comfortable warm area,\" to prospective snow shovelers.\nThat was before the postseason contest, originally scheduled for Sunday afternoon, got postponed on Saturday due to public safety concerns amid an ongoing winter weather emergency in western New York.\nGet Philly local news, weather forecasts, sports and entertainment stories to your inbox.\n[Sign up for NBC Philadelphia newsletters.]\nThe heavy snow and high winds caused the game to be\n[moved to Monday at 4:30 p.m. ET](/news/sports/nfl/how-to-watch-bills-vs-steelers-wild-card-game-on-monday).\nWhile the snow was still coming down early Sunday, clean-up efforts were underway at the Orchard Park, New York,\n[NFL](/tag/nfl) stadium. And a member of Bills Mafia was helping out in a very Bills Mafia fashion.\nNFL\nThe Bills have since\nasked prospective snow shovelers to abide by travel bans and not report to the stadium until the bans are lifted.\n\"There will eventually be multiple shifts available for snow shovelers to work and be part of the team to get the venue ready for the hometown Bills [wild-card playoff game] vs. the Steelers,\" the team said on Sunday.\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul\nannounced Sunday afternoon that a travel ban remains in place for the City of Buffalo, across central Erie County and the Southtowns. But Hochul did say that the Steelers-Bills game \"will not be pushed back again.\"\nThe Steelers, meanwhile, flew from Pittsburgh to Buffalo on Sunday afternoon.\nThe\nweather forecast in Orchard Park on Monday calls for a high of 16 degrees and a low of 13, with winds from 10 to 20 mph. Snow showers are expected in the morning but there's only around a 9% chance of precipitation at kickoff time.\n\"I'm not saying it's going to be pleasant, but conditions won't be life threatening either,\" Hochul said, via\nESPN.",

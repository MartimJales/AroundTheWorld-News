    "text": "Latrobe Street Mission brings warmth through freezing temperatures PARKERSBURG, W.Va. (WTAP) - Latrobe Street Mission will be relaxing their rules as we see below freezing temperatures the next few days. “People can come in and get warm, get food, they can use the restroom or whatever they need to do so frostbite won’t set in. We do provide clothing as well or anything they need to stay warm,” said Shelter Manager, Natosha Roberson. Providing for those inside and outside if the shelter is a tough task but Roberson gets her inspiration from the bible. “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you took me into your home. That is what we live by at LSM,” Roberson said. Roberson is passionate about her job and it’s because she was in a similar position in 2016 when she was staying at LSM. “I actually used to be a resident here in 2016 so I know what it means to be hungry and be a stranger and be homeless so it truly means a lot to me to be able to be that person to extend more than just you have your hand out so here you go. It’s so much more than that, it’s providing a safe place to anybody that truly needs the basic needs in life,” said Roberson. For all shelter or warming station details you can contact LSM at [(304) 893-9460](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0TCorMUzLqbQ0YLRSNaiwsDCxMEkys0g2TTM3s0g1tzKoMLdItTQ0NDJKMjC1TDQyTfISy0ksKcpPSlUoLilKTS1RyM0sLs7MzwMAYU0XmA&q=latrobe+street+mission&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS976US976&oq=latrobe+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDQgBEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyDQgBEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyCggDEC4YsQMYgAQyBggEEEUYOTITCAUQLhiDARjHARixAxjRAxiABDIWCAYQLhiDARivARjHARixAxiABBiOBTINCAcQABiDARixAxiABDINCAgQLhivARjHARiABDIWCAkQLhiDARivARjHARixAxiABBiOBdIBCTI5ODBqMGoxNagCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#).

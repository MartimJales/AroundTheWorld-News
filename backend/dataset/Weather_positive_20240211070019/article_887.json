    "text": "I hope that you are staying cozy and warm during this unseasonably cold winter weather. Over the last couple of days, I have found myself humming one favorite winter songs \"Snow\" from one of my favorite movies \"White Christmas\". \"Snow. It won't be long before we'll all be there with snow,\" reading the lyrics is not quite the same as hearing Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Peggy Lee singing them in perfect harmony, but if you are like me, you can hear them in your mind. Although it is frigid outside, I think we are going to miss a magical dusting of white this time around, but lucky for me I am recently back from ringing in 2024 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming where I celebrated a white New Year. Jackson Hole is like a winter fairyland. It is what I would imagine the North Pole would look like. Looking down on the town, gold and gleaming in the night, from the Snow King Mountain is pure magic. Even more magical is the glowing red torch parade snaking down the white mountain and the spectacular sparkling display of fireworks exploding in the night sky to usher in another wonderful year! I love the snowy cold in moderation. It is crisp and fun, not the bone chilling, damp cold we are experiencing. Bundled up from head to toe, I love the novelty of all the winter activities. The sparkling scenery is enchanting to me. I rang in 2023 in Jackson Hole, but in this charming part of the country it feels like there is a new adventure around every corner. This year we decided to conquer dog sledding while in Wyoming and I can tell you it was the exhilarating adventure of a lifetime. The pups were literally dancing with excitement as we boarded our sled. As they bounded over the frozen terrain, we skittered and slid our way along the banks of the stunning Snake River with the imposing Tetons in the background. It was a breathtaking and enlivening experience. After our dog-powered exploit, we warmed ourselves with some steaming hot cocoa and hopped on snow mobiles for a four-hour tour of the staggering Teton National Park. We sailed through the woods, climbed to breathtaking lookouts, rode over frozen rivers and took on terrain that was only accessible by snow mobile, enabling us to see the spectacular beauty of the park dressed in its winter best unspoiled by the masses. It was simply amazing. Second only to a drive thru the Teton Pass, which left me even more in awe of the strength and fortitude of the pioneers who made their way over these perilous and formattable mountains in horse drawn wagons. In the comfort of our warm, four-wheel-drive wagon we wound our way through Teton Pass and on to the charming village of Driggs, Idaho. It was a snowy adventure that was one of the most fun of my life. All of our frosty exploits left us hungry and luckily Jackson Hole is a foodie heaven. We went back to some old favorites from last year including Gather and the Gun Barrel Steak and Game House, but we also feathered in some new-to-us places as well, including the Blue Lion. Nestled in a house turned restaurant, the atmosphere was homey and the live music made the scrumptious meal feel celebratory and relaxing all at the same time. I feasted on the velvety elk tenderloin, which was made even more amazing by the creamy polenta and rich red wine. We capped the meal off with a decadent slice of buckeye pie, which was not on my diet plan. So rich and memorable was the pie that I decided to make smaller, more waistline friendly buckeye balls to enjoy while braving this cold snap. They are a great bite sized treat and would be a welcomed treat for your Valentine. I can't wait to share more of my snowy adventures with you, including a stunning meal at Piste. Stay warm my friends.",

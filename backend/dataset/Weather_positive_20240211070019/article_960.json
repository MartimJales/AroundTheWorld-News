    "text": "Utah residents: this won't be news to you. You're living it. To everyone else: ski resorts in Utah just benefitted from an impressive storm cycle that deposited 70 to 80 inches of snow over the past few days. Remember when we were all concerned about the lack of snow in December? You can kiss those fears goodbye for now (if you live in or near Salt Lake City, Utah, that is). Here are a few of the storm totals reported by Utah ski resorts today: Alta Ski Area: 84 inches ( \"holiday weekend\" ) Brighton Resort: 73 inches (last seven days) Deer Valley: 27 inches (last three days) Park City Mountain: 73 inches (last seven days) Powder Mountain: 70 inches (last seven days) Snowbasin: 49 inches ( \"storm\" ) Snowbird: 60 inches (last seven days) Solitude Mountain Resort: 34 inches (last three days) The storm totals, some offered in three-day rather than seven-day formats, vary slightly, with Alta claiming the highest storm cycle snowfall amount. Presumably, the resorts that only report in three-day increments received somewhere in the 70 to 80-inch range over the past week. The snow was primarily concentrated in and around the Cottonwood Canyons, with ski resorts outside the Salt Lake City bubble receiving less snowfall. Brian Head Resort in southern Utah saw eight inches of snow in the past 72 hours. The heavy snowfall wasn't all hassle-free powder skiing for the Cottonwood Canyon and Cottonwood Canyon-adjacent resorts. Alta Ski Area faced a 34-hour interlodge (a safety precaution where everyone must remain inside because of avalanche risk) over the long weekend. Powder Mountain temporarily closed late last week due to frigid temperatures. I imagine the locals considered these delays minor compared to the thrill of skiing feet upon feet of fresh snow, though. And the best part? Another storm is blowing into the Salt Lake City area tonight that could deposit up to a foot of snow on Wednesday at multiple ski resorts. Don't miss another headline from POWDER!

    "text": "New Delhi: The lengthy dry spell in the Kashmir valley came to an end after the Gurez area in North Kashmir's Bandipora district witnessed light snowfall overnight even as minimum temperatures rose a few degrees in several parts of the valley, the Weather department said on Saturday. A weak western disturbance hit Jammu and Kashmir on Friday night due to which light snowfall occurred in the Gurez area in north Kashmir, they said. As the region is facing dry spells and warm days, Drass in Ladakh also received very light snowfall. According to the officials in the weather department, Jammu and Kashmir recorded a 79 per cent rain deficiency in December compared to the average rainfall of the season. The dry spell continued as there was no precipitation in the first week of January as well adding more to the worries of farmers and the people living in the region. Kashmir is currently under the grip of 'Chilla-i-Kalan', a 40-day harsh winter period during which a cold wave sweeps the region and temperatures are mostly in freezing magnitudes leading to the freezing of water bodies as well as water in pipes. The chances of snowfall are the highest during this period and most areas, particularly the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall during the 40-day phase. 'Chilla-i-Kalan' will end on January 31.",

    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The forecast for this upcoming week can be described in one word: cold. This cold weather will have an impact on how crews keep roads clear when snow is expected to fall Sunday and into Monday.\nWith just snow expected in this storm, Nichole Lawrence with TDOT said they are ready to get going.\n“You know when it is snow, we can get ahead of that and apply that salt brine mixture to the roadways and do that pretreatment,\" she said.\nThis week presents a unique challenge. While the snow might be easier to clear, the temperatures will play a big role, something that Dave Parker with ARDOT said they are ready for.\n“The frigid temperatures are really, possibly the biggest concern,\" said Parker.\nLiquid water contains H20 molecules that keep their distance from each other due to the heat they contain.\nCredit: ABC24 As soon as we hit freezing those molecules come together and create solid ice.\nCredit: ABC24 Salt can be applied to keep this from happening and can be effective.\nCredit: ABC24 Related Articles Why January is the coldest winter month in the Mid-South The National Weather Service's Memphis radar will be down for two weeks. Here's why: When temperatures are colder, you have to use more salt to remove the same amount of snow. In fact when the ground temperature drops below 25, like it is expected to next week, normal salt is actually really bad at melting frozen roads. Crews are prepared for this situation with some unique solutions.\nCredit: ABC24 “When you get down into the low 20s and the teens we will shift to a beet juice with that salt brine lowers the freezing temperature, makes things work a little better,\" said Parker.\nTDOT said they have their own special addition of Potato Juice that works in the same way.\nOnce in the single digits though, a switch to Calcium Chloride becomes the only way to keep roads clear.\nBefore using those methods, all 3 state DOTs in the Mid-South said you can expect to see crews begin treating roads with the traditional salt brine this coming Saturday.",

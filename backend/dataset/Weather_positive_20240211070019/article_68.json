    "text": "Out of the frozen frying pan and into the fire.\nThe Edmonton Oilers might have avoided a stretch of -30 C temperatures back home as they’ve spent the week on an Original Six road trip, but they ended up with about as much heat as they could handle in a red-hot Alex Lyon.\nThe Detroit Red Wings goalie came up with 44 saves Thursday in a bid to put an end to Edmonton’s eight-game win streak.\nBut the Oilers came from behind to pull out a 3-2 overtime victory to tie a franchise-record ninth win in a row.\nIt eclipses a previous high of eight wins they strung together in the end of November and early December, which ended with three losses in a row prior to going on their current streak.\nThat gives Edmonton a 17-3 record since U.S. Thanksgiving on Nov. 24, to push their record under new head coach Kris Knoblauch to 19-6 — an incredible rebound from the 3-9-1 start to the season under the Jay Woodcroft regime.\nAnd it’s got them right back into the playoff race, as they improved to 22-15-1 and moved into a tie for seventh place in the Western Conference with the Nashville Predators. And for as far as they still have left to go, they’ve come a long way from being the 31st-ranked team in the league following a franchise-worst 2-9-1.\nAnd they have given themselves a chance to set a new high watermark for the franchise as they look to make it 10 in a row for the first time, when they take on the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday (5 p.m., CBC, Sportsnet).\nThursday’s win marked the third time the Oilers have won nine games in a row, with, neither previous time coming during the dynasty days of the 1980s. The last one came down the playoff stretch a season ago, while the first nine-game streak occurred back in 2001.\nE-mail: [email protected]\nOn Twitter: @GerryModdejonge\nCopyright Postmedia Network Inc., 2024",

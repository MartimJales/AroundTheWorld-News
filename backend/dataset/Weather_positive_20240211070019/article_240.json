    "text": "If You Get One Thing Before the Storm, We Recommend This Electric Snow Shovel—And It’s on Sale Conquer snowy driveways with this durable, electric snow tool from Greenworks. Winter storm Gerri and winter storm Heather are expected to impact much of the United States this week and next. Snow storms are quite typical in January, so ensuring your home is prepped with the [necessary tools to combat heavy snowfall](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/winter-storm-prep-buy-online-pick-up-today/) is crucial. If you haven’t picked up your snow tools yet, now’s your last chance before the first big snowstorms of 2024. Lucky for you, the [Greenworks 80V Electric Snow Shovel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YYPQPYC/?tag=bv-greenworks-snow-blower-sale-20&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobvila.com%2Farticles%2Fgreenworks-80v-electric-snow-shovel-sale&ascsubtag=0000BV0000306452O 20240113020000)—one of the best electric snow shovels we’ve tested—is on sale right now. [Our tester Zach Lazzari tested](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/greenworks-80v-electric-snow-shovel-review/) the [Greenworks 80V Electric Snow Shovel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YYPQPYC/?tag=bv-greenworks-snow-blower-sale-20&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobvila.com%2Farticles%2Fgreenworks-80v-electric-snow-shovel-sale&ascsubtag=0000BV0000306452O 20240113020000), rating it a 9 out of 10 for its easy-to-use design, excellent battery, and durable build. In fact, it beat out eight other models that Lazzari tested in more than a foot of Montana snow this season, claiming “Best Overall” award in our guide to [the best electric snow shovels](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/best-electric-snow-shovel/). Its unique chute-less design continuously propels the snow forward (20+ feet away). “During testing, this model performed excellently, but the battery and power were the real difference makers,” Lazzari notes. “The Greenworks 80V just kept on going, and the auger speed felt more powerful than competing models.” Altogether, it provides continuous 45 minutes of runtime, and the battery recharges in just 30 minutes on its rapid charger. While its 45 minutes on a single charge is already impressive, Greenworks also offers batteries of up to 5 amp hours, which would grant you an even longer snow-clearing action between charges. Plus, it’s easy to use. Connect the battery to the port, then grip the lower handle and battery simultaneously to get it moving. Other notable features of this electric model include its sharp auger blade and a 12-inch shoveling width for clearing driveways, walkways, decks, and patios. Normally retailing around $300, the Greenworks 80V Electric Snow Shovel is now nearly a third off—a steal ahead of peak snow. Head to Amazon to [take advantage of this deal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YYPQPYC/?tag=bv-greenworks-snow-blower-sale-20&asc_source=browser&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobvila.com%2Farticles%2Fgreenworks-80v-electric-snow-shovel-sale&ascsubtag=0000BV0000306452O 20240113020000) before it’s gone for good.

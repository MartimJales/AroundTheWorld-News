In this type of weather, Monument Health takes protective measures to prepare for cases of hyperthermia and frostbite. When you think of freezing weather, most people head to the store to stock up on food and prepare to stay indoors. However, it’s not just individuals who are preparing; hospitals are also getting ready for the sub-zero temperatures, especially the Emergency Room. “For the most part, we get things ready like extra warm blankets. We have warm fluids for patients, and we prepare for injuries for cold weather injuries,” said Monument Health Rapid City Hospital Medial Doctor Brook Eide. According to Eide those who are most at risk for cold weather injuries are the homeless community, elderly individuals, and those dealing with substance abuse issues. “This cold temperature can cause frostbite in just minutes. If you do get cold, it’s important to warm yourself quickly. Warm fluids, warm blankets, and get out of that cold. If your temperature is below 95 degrees, that’s really what we consider hypothermia. And as we start to see more problems, if you stop shivering, it’s important to start warming yourself. When it comes to burns departments, we can evaluate you,” said Eide. Eide encourages people to stay indoors if possible but says to add layers if you must go out. Black Hills residents are taking his advice to heart. “I think I’m going to just focus on layering up and making sure that I come prepared, just as far as keeping the weather gear, as far as things go,” said Michaela Brown. If you notice symptoms of frostbite or hypothermia, such as numbness, tingling, or extreme cold, it’s important to seek medical attention. Copyright 2024 KOTA. All rights reserved.",

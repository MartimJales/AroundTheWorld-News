    "text": "Today's snowfall may have brought widespread school closures for the second time this week, but it's also great news for snow sports enthusiasts.\nFor the first time this winter, Dane County Parks have been hit with enough powder to open their snowmobile trails . All Dane County snowmobile trails will open for the season at 3 p.m. Friday, Jan. 12, the parks system announced in a news release. \"Good\" trail conditions have been reported.\nAt least 6 inches of snow and steady, below-freezing temperatures were needed before the trails could open.\n\"With the trails opening, snowmobile enthusiasts are eager to take their first ride of the season,\" Mark Stephens, president of the Dane County Council of Snowmobile Clubs , said. \"This is the first time that we’ve had adequate snow conditions to open the trails. We want to remind riders to use caution and watch for changing conditions, as there will likely be uneven terrain, snow-covered icy sections and the potential for open water in the marshes and waterways.\"\nLive coverage: Power outages, live forecast, snow totals, road conditions, more winter storm updates Friday\nWhat Wisconsin snowmobilers should know when heading out to trails Dane County is home to over 500 miles of snowmobile trails , including the Badger, Glacial Drumlin and Military Ridge State Trails. All snowmobilers are required to have and display a state snowmobile trail pass when using the trail system.\nSnowmobilers should remember to stay on the trails and watch for snow groomers, Dane County Parks said in the release.\n\"The majority of snowmobile trails are on private lands throughout Dane County. Riders should not deviate from designated trails. Snowmobile trails are for snowmobiles only unless otherwise designated, so please obey trail signs,\" said Sgt. Kyle McNally of the Dane County Sheriff’s Office Marine and Trail Enforcement Bureau.\nIn the parks system release, McNally reminded snowmobilers to \"drive safely, not drink and drive, and to review all snowmobile regulations before venturing out on the trails.\"\nFor up-to-date information on trail openings and closing, visit the Dane County Council of Snowmobile Clubs' website or Facebook page or call the Snowmobile Trails Hotline at (608) 242-4576. For Dane County Parks trail closures and conditions, visit the Dane County Parks Closures and Trail Conditions webpage .\nWhat to know: When do Wisconsin's ski hills and resorts open for the season?",

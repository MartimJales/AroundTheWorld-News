In fact, they see it as a good thing for the region. For many in Santa Fe, snow is not a problem. In fact, they see it as a good thing for the region. The snow is piling up across New Mexico, and many people see it as a beneficial factor. \"I think the snow provides most of the moisture and rainfall that we need for the summer, so it's really good to have it,\" Tabitha Martinez said. Martinez and her family are taking advantage of the snow and making the most out of what's in front of them. From sledding to strolling downtown and enjoying the atmosphere, there is no shortage of powder in the New Mexico state capitol. Three to four inches could be seen across town. Road conditions are mostly cleared, but residents are still advising others to drive with care as conditions may vary across the area. \"If you don't know how to drive in the snow, just stay home,\" Martinez said. Santa Fe is expected to see more winter weather conditions on Sunday with a 50 percent chance of precipitation.",

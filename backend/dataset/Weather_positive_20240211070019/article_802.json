    "text": "Monday, January 15th 2024, 9:39 pm Over the last two days, St. James Episcopal Church on 303 E. Church Street in Wagoner has been running a warming center. It's the first time the church has ever done anything like this. The people who have taken advantage of it are thankful. Volunteers at the church are offering a place to stay overnight and things to keep people warm, and the most common reason people are coming is to get food. The Church says it's served more than 45 people over the last few days. Brad Wofford says he received a lot of help from the church when he walked in. \"Oh, they've hooked me up with some food, some sleeping bags that contain basically everything I'm wearing right now. Like all of this,\" said Wofford. This warming center has become a refuge for Brad and people in similar situations. \"Thought it was pretty cool,\" Wofford said. \"Not really used to it. I feel cared about.\" \"Thank you to everybody that come out here in the cold weather and to these people that came out to think about other folks than themselves,\" Edward Grayson, who received food from the church, said \"It's what makes Wagoner great.\" Volunteers say most of their visitors aren't staying overnight but will stay long enough to warm up and get something to eat. Volunteers know the importance of a warm meal; that's why they're even delivering them. \"Everybody wants food we've been delivering,\" Kellie Odeneal, St. James Episcopal Church Outreach Director, said. \"We've delivered probably 18 or so meals out yesterday. And we have, I think, 16 or 18 packed up right now, ready to go out. Everybody's hungry.\" Back at the church, volunteers are preparing for another extremely cold night, ready to serve whoever comes through the doors. \"Any place that keeps you from dying gives you a little bit of hope,\" said Wofford. St. James Episcopal Church will keep its warming center open through Wednesday. They say they could reopen again depending on the weather.

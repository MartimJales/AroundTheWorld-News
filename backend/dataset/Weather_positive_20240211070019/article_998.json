    "text": "Watch this water bottle freeze in just seconds at the Chiefs game KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Gray News) – Temperatures at the Kansas City Chiefs game this weekend were so cold that water bottles froze instantly when they were taken out of concession stand refrigerators. Game attendee Keely Nadler posted a video on social media that shows her grabbing a Smart Water bottle out of a refrigerator at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday. Within seconds, the water froze completely from top to bottom. The game ended up being the [fourth-coldest game in NFL history](https://www.kctv5.com/2024/01/13/chiefs-dolphins-could-approach-nfl-record-coldest-game/) and the coldest game ever played at Arrowhead Stadium. The official temperature at kickoff was minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, with wind gusts making it feel like minus 27 degrees. The coldest game in NFL history remains minus 13 for the 1967 NFL championship, when the Packers beat the Cowboys at Lambeau Field in a game that came to be known as the Ice Bowl. The wind chill that day was minus 48 degrees. At Saturday’s game, dozens of fans needed medical treatment due to the cold, [KCTV reports](https://www.kctv5.com/2024/01/15/coldest-kc-chiefs-game-ends-with-dozens-fans-needing-emergency-attention/). The Kansas City, Missouri, Fire Department manned ambulances stationed at Arrowhead and responded to a total of 69 calls. Half of the calls were for hypothermia, and 15 people were taken to the hospital. The Chiefs won over the Miami Dolphins 26-7 and head to Buffalo for the AFC Divisional Round. The Chiefs and Bills will play Sunday, Jan. 21 at 5:30 p.m. CT. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

Tips to keep water going during sub-zero temperatures [Jordan Green](https://www.commercialappeal.com/staff/12264441002/jordan-green/) Protecting homes from icy temperatures is the goal for many Tennesseans this coming week as [subzero wind chills head our direction](/story/weather/2024/01/09/winter-storm-preparedness-in-tn-what-to-do-before-freezing-weather/72164770007/). Rather than spending thousands of dollars to try and fix pipes that might burst in your home next week, just take a few minutes to go through a checklist for home safety. Your kitchen may look silly with random cabinets open under the sink, but it will be worth it to not have to possibly replace any pipes after the freeze. Here are ways to keep your pipes from freezing during the chilly temperatures next week. How do I keep my pipes from freezing? Tips to keep water flowing It is recommended by [State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/dont-let-pipes-freeze-and-steps-to-take-if-they-do#:~:text=A%20trickle%20of%20water%20might,may%20help%20prevent%20frozen%20pipes.) to take time to make sure pipes don't freeze by following these steps: - Insulate pipes - Use heat tape or heat cables - Seal leaks in the home via windows or cracks - Secure outdoor faucets by draining and taking in hoses and sprinklers - Let both hot and cold water drip indoors to keep water flowing - Adjust the thermostat to stay warm overnight - Open cabinet doors to let air hit indoor pipes - Keep the garage door closed if exposed pipes are inside it What home temperature keeps pipes from freezing? Homes should be kept at a minimum of 55 degrees to keep pipes from freezing. This is the recommended temperature for people who are out of town. At what temperature do pipes freeze? Technically pipes can freeze in 32-degree weather, but most will not freeze until under 20 degrees. The longer the temperature remains under 20, the greater the chance of freezing. Pipes can fully freeze within six hours if the temperatures are cold enough. What pipes are most likely to freeze? Pipes that are not insulted and in open, unheated spaces are the most likely to freeze. These can be pipes in attics, basements or garages. As there is no warm air flowing to these pipes and they are exposed, they are at a greater risk. What to do if pipes freeze? State Farm also recommends taking these steps if your pipes do end up freezing because of the near-zero temperatures: - Shut off the water supply - Open faucets - Use a hair dryer or a space heater to warm pipes - Turn up the heat in the house - Do not use an open flame to warm pipes - Do not pour hot water down the drain to warm pipes - Call a plumber if needed",

    "text": "Sicamous RCMP responded to fewer incidents in the last quarter of 2023 than the previous year, with crime and traffic statistics both seeing a decrease. In a report to district council at its Jan. 10 meeting, Sgt. Murray McNeil said officers issued 122 tickets to drivers, down from 134 the year before, and added that the lack of precipitation had resulted in slightly less collisions despite December’s snowy start that resulted in a fatality. “The last couple of days we’ve been having this snow and, knock on wood, we’ve come out really well with it,” he said. “I was certain that we would have numerous collisions today based on the conditions that I saw driving around…but we didn’t have any collisions to report, which was surprising.” Overall crime stats saw an even greater decrease, from 429 to 373, with the biggest drop being driving complaints that were less than half of last year at 29 as compared to 67, which McNeil said could again be partly due to better road conditions. Frauds, however, jumped to six compared to just two last year, and McNeil said the RCMP will be holding a public session on fraud detection as per a request by Coun. Pam Beech. “Some of the frauds that we were seeing were the elderly getting contacted and asked to invest in different Bitcoin and things like that, some of these confusing things that promise excellent returns,” said McNeil. “So hopefully if we get a bit of an information session we can get some education out on that.” A constable from Salmon Arm will be conducting the meeting in the Sicamous library, with McNeil trying to schedule it for some time in February, with a second session also planned for the seniors centre. Those will be advertised as details are confirmed.",

    "text": " Scientists continue to conduct regular tests of the waters off Lahaina and say last week’s storm dumped more than 4 inches of rain.\n“It wasn’t a humungous storm, but it was certainly the biggest storm since the fire,” said Chris Shuler, UH-Manoa hydrologist at the Water Resources Research Center.\nSpecial Section: Maui Wildfires Disaster “The fact that it’s falling on a highly impacted burned area really drives concerns that there’s not only ash and contaminants mobilizing, but there is definitely mobilizing sediment,” he added.\nConfirmed test results aren’t available yet, but environmentalists say there are some encouraging signs. “There’s no doubt that toxicity has flowed into the ocean, but I think all the work that has been done has really reduced the amount that could have washed right in,” said Liz Yannell, program manager at Hui O Ka Wai Ola. “Soiltac must have kept the ash in place,” she added.\nExperts even saw a monk seal that came to rest on shore.\n“We’ve seen a lot of life more recently which warms your heart when you are out there,” said Yannell.\nAlso encouragingly, that burned chemical stench is gone and the landscape is being prepared for another change as the historic Pioneer Mill Smoke Stack remains standing above it all.\nBut residents say some things will never return.\nCounty: Lahaina wildfire debris to be wrapped in plastic before transfer to landfill\nSanford Hill, who lost his home at a senior living complex in Lahaina, recently returned to the community for the first time.\n“All the memories that I have going back 50 years of that place are gone,” said Hill.\nHe remembers Halloween parties during 70s and the home of Fleetwood’s on Front Street, but now the businesses and cottages by the sea just remnant memories.\n“No matter how they rebuild it, they are not going to capture what I remember ... because it’s just gone,” said Hill. “I don’t think they are ever be able to capture the character of Lahaina again.”\nCopyright 2024 ",

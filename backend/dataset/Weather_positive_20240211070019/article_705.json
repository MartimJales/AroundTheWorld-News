    "text": "With inclement weather entering our orbit, thoughts turn to loading up on Vitamin C, snuggling down, and dreaming of warmer days. You know, like Thursday. (Kidding. Sort of.)\nBusiness owners, there are some special editions and sections coming up (including this week’s Alive & Kicking self-improvement section and Valentine’s around the corner) with space available in print and online. Click the title to check out last year’s edition for each:\nSpecial Upcoming Dates at FWW:\nJanuary 17:\nAlive & Kicking\nJanuary 31 & February 7:\nValentine’s Day Section\nFebruary 14:\nMargarita Day Section\nMarch 13:\nSaint Patrick’s Day Section\nMarch 20 & 27:\nEaster Section\n*March 27:\nZest Magazine\nAlong with the special dates above, each week, we highlight one event for each day of the week in Night & Day and feature food and booze events in Ate Day8 a Week. Do you have any events or offers coming up that we need to know about? Please email for consideration. (For advertising inquiries, click\nhere.)\n*Yes. It’s time for ZEST 2024!\nMarch 27th is also when our 18th annual coffee-table-styled guide to eats, drinks, and shopping is published. This piece can be kept as a reference throughout the year for where to dine, imbibe, and hunt for foodie finds.\nWith thousands of places to choose from, we know how difficult it can be to decide. Each year, the Weekly provides our readers with one of the most comprehensive guides in North Texas. Zest informs the community about all the best bars & grills, farmers’ markets, food & grocery options, and restaurants, of course, all in one fell swoop.\nAnd if our readers wear out their print copy — we know that they will — never fear. Zest Magazine lives on FWWeekly.com in our magazine drop-down all year round enabling them to re-discover your business in the coming seasons too.\nOur final deadlines are Tuesdays for all the sections above, except for Zest Magazine. For that, we need to hear from you by Friday, March 22nd. If you’re interested in reserving space, please contact your FWW representative ASAP or click\nhere to submit an inquiry.",

    "text": "Monsoonal Trough Continues to Drench Far North Queensland, Flooding Risk Looms\nNovak Djokovic Declares Wrist Injury Pain-Free Ahead of Australian Open\nWorld number one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, has announced his wrist injury to be pain-free, setting the stage for his title defense at the Australian Open. Seeking his 11th Australian Open victory and a record 25th Grand Slam title, Djokovic is set to commence his campaign against Croatian qualifier Dino Prizmic.\nUnfazed by Recent Setbacks\nFacing a recent wrist injury during the United Cup, which necessitated treatment during a loss to Alex de Minaur, the Serbian champion has been practicing without pain and exudes optimism about his performance in the forthcoming matches. Djokovic’s potential to overcome adversity is not new; he has previously managed more severe problems in his last two triumphant campaigns.\nAn Unbroken Streak\nDjokovic, who has not experienced defeat at the Australian Open since 2018, and has emerged victorious in every final he has contested at Melbourne Park, is on a 28-match winning streak. His powerful determination to win every Grand Slam he participates in is reflected in his unassailable record.\nBeyond the Court\nOff the court, Djokovic has a unique ritual of spending time in Melbourne’s Botanical Gardens, where he enjoys grounding himself by hugging and climbing trees. This personal practice reveals the human side of this towering tennis figure, illustrating the mental strategies he uses to stay focused and composed.\nLooking at the Record Books\nFinishing the previous year as world number one, Djokovic bagged three of the four major titles. His current aim is to surpass Margaret Court’s all-time Grand Slam record by securing his 25th major title. Given his current form, this feat is well within his grasp.\nTournament Changes and Notable Participants\nThe Australian Open has extended to a 15-day event to prevent late-night finishes, a change that has found favor among other players like Andy Murray. The tournament will also feature notable participants such as Stefanos Tsitsipas, Carlos Alcaraz, and Daniil Medvedev, promising a high level of competition.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

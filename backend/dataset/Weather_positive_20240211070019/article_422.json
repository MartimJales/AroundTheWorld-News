    "text": "Emanuel Miller scored with six seconds remaining and host TCU handed No. 2 Houston its second straight loss in a 68-67 thriller on Saturday afternoon in Fort Worth, Texas. With less than 10 seconds left, TCU's Avery Anderson III dribbled atop the key before finding Miller cutting toward the basket. Miller caught the pass in stride and laid it off the glass, putting the Horned Frogs in front. TCU (13-3, 2-1 Big 12) negated Houston's (14-2, 1-2) opportunity to win at the buzzer, as Micah Peavy came up with a steal on the defensive end to seal the victory. Miller led TCU with 13 points and five assists. Anderson finished with a team-best six assists and 11 points as TCU defeated its second straight Top 10 opponent. J'wan Roberts was Houston's leading scorer with 20 points. Houston's defensive intensity generated an early 13-5 advantage. TCU shot just 27.3 percent in the first half but a 13-for-20 mark at the free-throw line kept the Horned Frogs in contention. TCU's 5-0 run with under four minutes remaining cut Houston's lead to 26-25, but the Cougars soon gained separation to take a 31-29 halftime lead. TCU scored first in the second half, as Ernest Udeh Jr.'s layup knotted the score at 31 apiece. After Jamal Shead countered with a layup, Anderson connected on a 3-pointer with 18:08 left, putting the Horned Frogs in front for the first time since the early minutes of the opening half. Xavier Cork and Jameer Nelson Jr. recorded layups on consecutive possessions to give TCU a 46-41 lead with 13:23 remaining. The margin widened to six points on three occasions over the next four minutes, before Houston reeled the Horned Frogs in. With 8:10 left, Emanuel Sharp's 3-pointer cut TCU's lead to 53-52. The key for the Cougars was an 8-0 run that resulted in a 62-59 lead with 4:22 left, but TCU kept the margin narrow down the stretch, taking back the lead for good on Miller's go-ahead score with six seconds remaining. --Field Level Media",

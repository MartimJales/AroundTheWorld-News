    "text": "TULSA, Okla. — As the temperatures continue to drop, a Tulsa homeless shelter is calling on the community to step up. The Merchant in the Pearl District is planning to stay open 24 hours a day until next Thursday to help get people off the streets and into a warm place, but they say they need more volunteers to help out. The Merchant Shelter The shelter normally opens for 2 hours, but is turning into a 24-hour shelter. Paul Schmidt, who runs the shelter, is stocking up on supplies at The Merchant to make sure the homeless community have a warm place to stay. \"We’re wanting just to help where we can, get as many in as we can and make sure they don’t freeze,\" Schmidt said. Schmidt says its vital to help get people off the streets. \"In Tulsa, right now there’s 560 shelter beds. In Tulsa right now there close to 1,200 [people] that are out every night. We are way short of shelter beds and with this kind of weather, they will die if something isn't done,\" Schmidt said. \"In the last year, we’ve had a good number of people have passed away from weather-related cold weather and so it’s a very real thing.\" He says temporary cots they have will give 40 people somewhere to sleep. The Merchant Shelter Cot Schmidt says the shelter normally feeds around 150 people a day, but they’ll have to give out 3 meals a day during the bad weather which Iron Gate will help out with. \"After we serve the evening meals, these will all fold up and go into the back of the kitchen and then we’ll put cots down around here,\" Schmidt said. He says because of donations, they’ve stocked up on warm clothes and have 150 blankets. Schmidt is calling for volunteers to help out at the shelter. \"We’re trying to get at least 4 volunteers for every 4 hours,\" Schmidt said. \"We do have security, we do have fire people in the building, but we need people helping serve the meals. Help, just be here for the people. So it’s really important, we need all the help we can get right now.\" He’s calling on the community to help and says it might just save a life \"If you want to help save lives this is a chance,\" Schmidt said. The Merchant is opening Friday evening at 5 p.m. and is going to stay open through to next Thursday morning.

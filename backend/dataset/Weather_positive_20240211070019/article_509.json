    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS â€” Corey Ohlenkamp says Indy DPW crews have been out since Friday, and so far, everything is going according to plan. \"They're obviously looking at that wind, they're looking at that ever changing road conditions and that bitter cold we've been talking about,\" Ohlenkamp said. He said drivers should be cautious as wind gusts of up to 40 mph and [temperatures in the single digits take over central Indiana](https://www.wthr.com/weather). \"If it looks good out, that doesn't mean the roads can't be slick, especially in the overnight hours. So, take your time and be patient. Give yourself a little extra time and space while you're commuting around town,\" Ohlenkamp said. Now their focus is on the rest of the week and the possibility of more snow. Freezing cold temperatures are also a big concern as a [Wind Chill Advisory ](https://www.wthr.com/weather/alerts)has been put in effect until Monday at 12 p.m. \"We are expecting these frigid temps to go through most the start of this week. That's something we are keeping a close eye on. It changes how people need to be ready for things. Obviously, this bitter cold is very dangerous outside, so you want to be prepared for handling that,\" Ohlenkamp said. DPW crews are still working 12-hour shifts, according to Ohlenkamp. \"Keeping a close eye on the weather forecast and making sure we are ready to go whenever and wherever we are needed,\" Ohlenkamp said. On average, DPW has around 80 trucks on the road during a snow fight. This year, many of the drivers are new and this is their first big winter weather event, and their confident this won't be the last. \"This will be a chance we got some practice this weekend. I guarantee you we will have more practice before the month is out,' Ohlenkamp said. He said they're ready for it. \"When the city needs them, they're there to stand up. They're there to do what they need to do and make sure everyone gets home safe,\" Ohlenkamp said.",

    "text": "PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- The snow drought is over!\nAfter nearly two years, Philadelphia finally has accumulating snow .

If there's freezing rain in your area, any cleared surfaces will develop a light glaze and make it much more difficult to walk on.\nRELATED: Philadelphia International Airport reporting delays, cancellations Tuesday\nRELATED: Dozens of schools reporting closures, delays\nMore from CBS News PHL Airport reporting delays, cancellations Tuesday What to know about road conditions in Pa., NJ, Del. after snow falls Pennsylvania, New Jersey residents and officials prepare for snow, cold temps NEXT Weather: Arctic blast arrives, tracking two chances for snow In: Pennsylvania Winter Weather NEXT Weather Snow Totals Delaware Philadelphia Alexandra Simon Alexandra Simon is a digital content producer at CBS Philadelphia.

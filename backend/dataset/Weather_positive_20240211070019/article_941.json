    "text": "A little bit of snow -- okay, a TON of snow -- wasn't gonna stop Bills and Steelers fans from making their way to the stadium for Monday's Wild Card game ... with diehard supporters trudging to their seats in time for kickoff.\nThe playoff matchup was originally slated to go down on Sunday ... but Mother Nature had other plans, as a snowstorm forced the N.Y. governor and NFL commish Roger Goodell to push it back a day.\nThe Bills pulled out all the stops in hopes of getting Highmark Stadium ready in time for the contest ... even offering folks $20 an hour to help clear out the snow.\nDespite the efforts, there was plenty left over from the storm ... but judging by videos of spectators walking through knee-deep piles in order to get to their seats, they didn't care one bit.\nIn fact, when Buffalo tight end Dawson Knox caught the first touchdown of the game, Bills Mafia made use of the extra snow by throwing it up in the air to celebrate.\nAll things considered, the field looks damn good for the game ... with not one snowflake in sight.\nThe Bills -- who are no strangers to uncooperative weather -- have the early lead over Pittsburgh ... but there's still plenty of ball left.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Recommended for you 1 Weather Alert See All > Weather Alert ...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM EST WEDNESDAY... * WHAT...Heavy snow expected.

    "text": "In a release from St. Vincent de Paul (SVdP), the organization says they are working to respond to the needs of the \"most vulnerable neighbors\" during this cold weather. Here are the list of services they are offering as well as updates for what their crews are doing/in need of: The Eugene Service Station is offering a warming center and day shelter with no one being turned away. The Dusk to Dawn congregate shelter for unhoused adults has temporarily moved to the Lane County Fairgrounds. The First Place Annex Night Shelter for unhoused families is at capacity. They have sent as many families as possible to local motels that are now at capacity as well. We are looking for another partner hotel and sending families to Egan Warming Centers locations for the time being. We are sending crews out to check on our various sites and shuttle people to Egan locations as needed. Blankets, hats, gloves, and warming items have been collected at 888 Garfield today. We will accept similar donations at the Chad Drive location on Monday. Stores are closed but SVdP says that any closure puts a strain on funding for their programs. The fact that we’ve also had to close our stores for several days, and lose that primary source of operational revenue, is placing a real strain on the organization, and we’re asking the public for help. If you are able to leave your home safely, they are asking for donations of blankets, hats, and gloves tomorrow at their administrative offices on 2890 Chad Drive in Eugene. They will also be accepting donations of blankets, pillows, eggs, coffee, sugar, butter, and milk tomorrow at First Place Family Center (4060 W. Amazon Drive in Eugene) as well as shelf-stable food at the fairgrounds. Finally, they are in need of volunteers at the Egan Warming Centers, particularly for the 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. shifts. Drivers are also needed to shuttle between the Eugene Service Station and Fairgrounds between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Volunteers can [sign up on their website](https://www.svdp.us/services/shelter-assistance/egan-warming-centers/) or by [emailing Tim Black](tim.black@svdp.us). Donations can also be made online at the [St. Vincent de Paul website](https://www.svdp.us/) by clicking the donate button. We will have more as we receive updates from SVdP during this winter weather emergency.",

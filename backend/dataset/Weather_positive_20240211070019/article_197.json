    "text": "Arthur Street Hotel and SOS International team up to help homeless prepare for winter storms LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - The Arthur Street Hotel (ASH) and SOS International are partnering to ensure members of the homeless community have some of the resources they need to deal with the coming winter storms and the dangerously low temperatures they will bring. Friday morning, SOS delivered 3,500 pounds of personal hygiene items, gloves, cleaning supplies and a hospital bed. These items will be used to stock the hotel’s first aid area and volunteers will be organizing blankets, tents and other supplies that will be distributed in the coming days. According to the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless, there are more than 12,000 houseless individuals in the city and that population is at increased vulnerability during severe weather. That makes access to warm clothing and necessities essential. “We’ve worked really hard to make sure we are meeting people where they are. and so for us to be able to have those supplies both here at the hotel and for our outreach is just really amazing,” Arthur Street Hotel Executive Director Susan Buchino said. ASH is also accepting monetary donations as well as gently used coats, blankets, gloves, and hats. To donate and find more information, [click here.](https://careatash.org/) Copyright 2024 WAVE.

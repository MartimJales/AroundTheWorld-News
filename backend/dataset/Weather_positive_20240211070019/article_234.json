    "text": "Madison woman runs essential errands for people during winter storm MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - While many Wisconsinites are avoiding travel this weekend amidst severe weather, one woman is driving into the storm to help her neighbors. One of the reasons Jenni Cardell moved from Colorado to Wisconsin is for the snow. She adds it’s a great part about living in the state. “I mean, it’s beautiful snow, it’s a heavy snow,” she said. “You know this is, as far as I’m concerned, a great part about living in Wisconsin.” Cardell is the primary care-provider for her aunt who lives with progressive dementia. Already giving up hours of her time to help out, Cardell was inspired to do more. “I know how important it is to be able to have access and get out and around, which is why I bought the snow tires,” she said. “So it just occurred to me this morning that maybe people would have some needs and that I would be able to get out and help somebody.” Cardell posted on a Facebook group ‘Dane County Neighbors Helping Neighbors,’ offering to help anyone in the Madison area in need of a ride. “I mean, as long as I have the availability and, you know, I’ve got a vehicle that is safe compared to a lot of people who don’t have vehicles that are as safe as mine. It’s a big heavy car, big heavy snow tires, dedicated snow tires.” From driving people to the grocery store, to picking up their medications at the pharmacy, requests started coming in, and Cardell hit the road Friday. “If you have the ability to help, you know, put the offer out there and don’t be afraid that, you know, people will ask you things. You can always say no and you can always just say, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing that,’ or ‘I do feel comfortable doing that one.’ You know, just make the offer and know that you can say no.” Cardell says she will continue to offer people help whenever she has free time.

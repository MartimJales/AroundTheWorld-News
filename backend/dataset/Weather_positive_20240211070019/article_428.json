    "text": "Rashee Rice caught eight passes for 130 yards and a touchdown and Harrison Butker kicked four field goals as Kansas City overcame frigid conditions in a 26-7 victory over Miami in their AFC wild-card game.\nAnd Houston thrashed Cleveland 45-14 in the AFC's other wild-card match, as CJ Stroud threw for three touchdowns and Steven Nelson and Christian Harris each had a pick-six.\nPatrick Mahomes threw for 262 yards and a touchdown and Isiah Pacheco rushed for 89 yards and a score to steer the third-seeded Chiefs in the frosty weather against the visiting Dolphins on Saturday night.\nAt kickoff, the temperature was minus 20C and felt like minus 32.8C, making it the fourth-coldest game in NFL history.\n\"The mindset was we knew it was going to be cold but let's go out there with that fire and see what happens,\" Mahomes said.\nFormer Chiefs star Tyreek Hill caught a 53-yard touchdown pass for sixth-seeded Miami. It was the first time Hill (five catches, 62 yards) played in Kansas City since being traded away following the 2021 season.\nMahomes completed 23 of 41 passes for Kansas City, which has recorded a playoff victory for the sixth straight season. Rice set a team postseason record with his 130 receiving yards, surpassing Elmo Wright (104 against Miami on December 25, 1971).\nTua Tagovailoa was 20-of-39 passing for 199 yards with one touchdown and one interception for the Dolphins. Miami has lost six straight playoff games since a wild-card victory over the Indianapolis Colts in 2000.\nButker's second field goal of the game, a 26-yarder, gave Kansas City a 13-7 lead with 7:36 left in the first half.\nHe added a 32-yarder with 18 seconds to go in the first half and tacked on a 21-yarder to make it 19-7 with 7:49 remaining in the third quarter.\nPacheco delivered a pivotal blow when he took a direct snap and scored from the 3 to boost the lead to 19 with 11:06 left in the game.\nIn Houston, Stroud completed 16 of 21 passes for 274 yards as the Texans won in the postseason for the first time since January 4, 2020.\nStroud (22 years, 102 days) became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff, surpassing Michael Vick.\n\"To see a young guy go out there, keep his composure, it kind of instills faith in everybody else as well,\" Harris said of Stroud's impact.\nNico Collins had six catches for 96 yards and a touchdown for the Texans (11-7), who rattled off 35 unanswered points after Cleveland's Kareem Hunt caught an 11-yard touchdown pass with 12:18 left in the second quarter.\nNelson and Harris effectively sealed the victory, with Nelson taking his interception 82 yards to the end zone to give Houston a 31-14 cushion with 6:05 remaining in the third quarter.\nThe Browns' attack came back out on the field and ran three plays before Joe Flacco was picked off by Harris, who darted 36 yards to make it a 24-point game.",

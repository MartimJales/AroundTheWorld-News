    "text": "Beatrice mayor credits resilience of residents and city employees, for making it through winter storms BEATRICE – Beatrice mayor Bob Morgan is thanking citizens and city employees for their resilience through the rough winter weather of late. \"The worst thing about cold weather is everything breaks. It just does. Whether its a water main they're trying to plug up...as I've said to many people who have called me....I have the same amount of snow pushed in my driveway as they did. Luckily, one of the things I've noticed about Beatrice you have a lot of help from neighbors. Not only thank you to all of the employees but to all of those neighbors that helped each other out.\" City Administrator Tobias Tempelmeyer says despite the tough road conditions and bitter cold, employees were still doing their jobs well. \"You've got guys out picking up trash, you've got police and fire running calls....electric guys making sure lights stay on. There's a whole long list of men and women who've done a great job..including those back at the office that are answering all of the phone calls from people who are unhappy about what the first people out there, did. One story that stood out to me is we had guys at the wastewater plant who stayed at the plant overnight....because they wanted to make sure they could get to work the next day and were not sure how the plant would handle it overnight...so they stayed there.\" Two bouts of snow and brutally cold conditions meant working outside was difficult. Street crews were working virtually around the clock for much of the week, including Saturday and Sunday shifts. At Monday night's city council meeting Beatrice officials have approved a change order increasing the payment to a company that did major water main construction work in Beatrice in 2023. The change increasing the amount by $1.18 million to Myers Construction Inc., was approved by the Beatrice City Council Monday night. The council approved three final contract payments to the company on a project that was funded by a more than $7 million interest-free state loan. The council also approved three reappointments to the Beatrice Planning and Zoning Commission…..Darrick Fletcher, Devin McGhee and John Riha. Hank Sunderman was appointed as a new member of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Laura McElravy was appointed as an alternate to the commission. The council gave second-round approval to an ordinance that amends how the city handles junked or inoperable vehicles. One more vote of approval is needed before it takes effect. City officials also approved another sponsorship agreement for improvements at Hannibal Park in Beatrice. Eakes Office Solutions will have their name on ball field signs, committing $4,700 over a five-year sponsorship agreement.",

    "text": "METROPOLIS, IL — As many prepare for cold weather and snow, Project Hope Humane Society reminds pet owners to keep four-legged friends in mind. Susan Howell, a volunteer and board member at Project Hope Humane Society, said animals are at risk of cold-related injuries. \"Their bodies have trouble, you know, protecting themselves against cold. Plus, just like humans, they can get frostbite and everything else,\" said Howell. The humane society keeps many of their animals indoors already, but they are taking steps to block out the cold for some of their larger animals. Howell said those who have outdoor animals should bring them inside or make the proper adjustments. \"Just anything to kinda get them out of the wind, protect them, and if possible, get heat to them, and, of course, they need fresh water and food,\" said Howell. Howell stresses the importance of keeping food bowls full to provide extra calories during cold weather and ensuring your pet's water supply doesn't freeze. As for indoor animals, Howell said short bathroom breaks outside won't hurt them, but to try and keep them indoors as much as possible. Cat shelters can be made out of tubs or boxes stuffed with straw— providing a warm place to get out of the cold; for larger dogs, usually kept outside, bringing them in the garage is a good alternative if there isn't space in the house.",

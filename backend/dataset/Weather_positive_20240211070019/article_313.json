    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) â€” During these freezing conditions, the Oklahoma Standard is on full display for some pet owners experiencing homelessness in the OKC metropolitan area. A group called [Angel Fund OKC](https://www.facebook.com/AngelFundOkc) donated blankets and dog kennels to the Homeless Alliance in Oklahoma City. \"If you own a dog or a cat, that pet is important to you,\" Taylor Self with the Homeless Alliance said. \"It's also important to our clients. Many of them are pet owners. So it's also important to us when we're caring for them, we also need to care for their pets.\" The Homeless Alliance saw the forecasted temperatures this weekend, and gave Misty Wilson's group a call. \"I got a phone call from a volunteer asking how fast they thought we could get kennels and blankets,\" Wilson said. \"I said, 'Well, I don't know. Let's try.\" Angel Fund OKC started a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/homeless-shelter-needs-place-for-pets-too?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unknown&utm_campaign=comms_gfm+homeless-shelter-needs-place-for-pets-too) Wednesday, January 10. It raised $900 within its first 18 hours of launching. The group donated blankets and 22 new dog kennels to the Homeless Alliance on Friday, January 12. \"If it means saving a dog, awesome, but if it means saving a dog's owner, even better,\" Wilson said. Self says this makes a huge difference for people who carry everything they have with them at all times. \"The idea of a dog kennel is not a super mobile thing either,\" Self said. \"So, not only are you worried about being inside and warming yourself up. It's also having a place for your belongings, for your pet, for all of your things.\" With these donations, the Homeless Alliance is turning their day shelter classroom into a dog room. \"A lot of our clients who have pets, you'll see them take care of their pets before they take care of themselves. They care about them. They're their chosen family. I think that now that they know their pets are being cared for, that there's a place for them to be, that's something they don't have to worry about. That's something we're honored to provide.\" Self tells Fox 25 her shelter is always [in need of donations](https://www.homelessalliance.org/donate), including dog treats, leashes, collars, blankets and beds.",

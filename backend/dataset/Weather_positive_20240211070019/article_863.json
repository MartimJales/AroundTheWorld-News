    "text": "Philadelphia finally snaps snowless streak after nearly 2 years It's official, more than an inch of snow has fallen in Philadelphia for the first time in nearly two years!\nPHILADELPHIA - It&apos;s official, more than an inch of snow has fallen in Philadelphia for the first time in nearly two years!\nThe snowless streak was snapped Monday night into Tuesday morning by a s mall system that produced just enough powder to end the city&apos;s longest recorded snow drought.\nA total of 1.5 inches of snow was recorded at Philadelphia International Airport just after midnight, according to the National Weather Service. That total reached 3â€“4 inches across the city several hours later.\nBefore Tuesday, the last measurable snowfall to blanket Philadelphia was back on January 29, 2022, when forecasters measured nearly 6 inches.\nThe 715-day record far surpassed the city&apos;s second-longest snow drought of 661 days that ended on Dec. 15, 1973.\nFeatured\narticle How long has Philadelphia gone without seeing over an inch of snow? Philadelphia is in something of a snow drought, but forecasters are optimistic it could end this winter.\nBelow freezing temperatures, which felt even colder from blustery wind gusts, helped make the record-breaking snowfall possible.\nThose temperatures will only get colder as the week continues with highs in the 20s expected by the weekend, and another chance of snow possible on Friday.",

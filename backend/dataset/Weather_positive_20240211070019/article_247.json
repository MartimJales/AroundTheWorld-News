    "text": "Serving up smiles during challenging time LORRAINE, New York (WWNY) - One of the last places to get power back on Friday was the Lorraine area but it’s the first place you’ll find a diner serving up a positive attitude. Keitha’s Kafe was forced to close on Wednesday and Thursday because of no power. “I don’t have a backup generator here at the diner therefore I lost two days of business,” said owner Keitha Robarge. It’s the first time she lost revenue due to weather-related conditions. “There’s a lot of local people who would have supported me during the power outage. People come out just to come out,” said Robarge. On Friday, her café was open and customers kept her busy. It’s the only business in the town of Lorraine making it a great meeting spot for members of the community “It gives us a place to meet, the three of us that are here today for lunch,” said customer Bill Spaulding. Spaulding and his friends use Keitha’s Kafe once a week to stay in touch. With more wind on the way, Robarge is hoping to be able to continue to provide a place where friends and family can meet. “We weathered the storm; we’re ready for the next one,” she said. As long as there’s power, Robarge will bring service with a smile. Copyright 2024 WWNY. All rights reserved.",

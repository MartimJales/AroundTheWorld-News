    "text": "MARTIN, TN-- Warming shelters across the Local 6 area are open in response to the blistering cold temperatures. The community coming together has inspired the volunteers. In below freezing temperatures like these, a safe place to warm up is something a lot of us take for granted. Unfortunately, it's something many go without. That's what inspired this community-led warming center in Martin, Tennessee. Joyce Washington is amazed at every donation from her community. “It's just really given me hope for my community that people really did come together,” Washington says. There are blankets and cots, food and water, and even free transportation from agencies like the Martin Police Department. Their community needs it all. “We're fooling ourselves if we think we don't have a population of unsheltered or shelter-sensitive people, because they exist out here,” says Washington. More than 30 volunteers signed up to work in the shelter or offered resources. Even after a day with no visitors in the warming center, Washington says it's still a success, because the community showed up to make it happen. “I'm okay that we didn't have anybody. That means that they found somewhere to go. But at least this community, this county, provided some option,” Washington says. With these cold temperatures sticking around, Washington says she doesn't know whether or not the shelter will open for the rest of the week. That all depends on weather conditions and whether volunteers will be available. The shelter will reopen for its last scheduled day Tuesday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. You can request a ride by calling 731-364-9226.",

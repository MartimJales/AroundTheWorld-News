    "text": "AURORA, Colo. — A dog seeking shelter in the cold weather was rescued Thursday by Aurora firefighters.\nAurora Fire Rescue said crews from Station 6 were able to rescue a small dog from under a car hood around 9 a.m. Thursday.\nGiven the bitterly cold temperatures, the dog presumptively sought warmth near the engine compartment.\nAurora fire crews lifted the vehicle with airbags and cribbing in order to reach the dog, and extended the front suspension components to remove the dog without causing injury.\nThe dog appeared to be uninjured in the operation. Animal Services were able to trace the dog’s microchip and bring the dog safely home.\nAurora Police and Aurora Animal Services assisted Aurora Fire Rescue at the scene Thursday.\nWind Chill Warnings have been posted through Tuesday morning by the National Weather Service for counties across Colorado, including the Palmer Divide, Denver area and eastern plains.\nPeriods of dangerous wind chill readings are expected mainly during the overnight periods Friday night through Tuesday morning. The wind and low temps will lead to wind chills of 20 below to 35 below zero, with the most severe conditions east of Interstate 25.\nThe coldest readings, approaching 35 below zero, are expected late Monday night into Tuesday morning across portions of the Plains.\nThe cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes. The National Weather Service recommends avoiding outside activities if possible during this period.\n\"When outside, make sure you wear several layers of appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves. Take precautions now to provide shelter for outdoor animals,\" said the National Weather Service.\nRelated Articles How to prevent your pipes from freezing this weekend Colorado governor issues disaster declaration for dangerously cold weather Wind Chill Warnings posted in Colorado through Tuesday as dangerous cold front arrives > Top stories curated daily just for you!

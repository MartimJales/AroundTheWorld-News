    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas - The artic blast is on its way, and we&apos;ve been saying over and over to remember the 4 Ps: Plants, people, pipes, and pets.\nAustin Pets Alive! went on social media asking for the community&apos;s help to foster the fur babies before the weather hits. Luis Sanchez, with APA!, says, so far, the response has been amazing.\n\"We&apos;ve had a few hundred people sign up to be fosters, and we&apos;re trying to get, as you know, through them as quickly as possible. So our team is really working hard to place as many dogs as possible, and we&apos;re really trying to get to zero by Sunday,\" says Luis Sanchez with Austin Pets Alive!.\nMORE STORIES:\nEmergency fosters needed for APA!'s outdoor shelter animals ahead of freezing temps Texas weather: Gov. Abbott speaks on state's response to arctic cold front Austin weather: Arctic front arriving earlier, bringing freezing temperatures APA! is hoping people will foster these dogs until Thursday, Jan. 18.\n\"But we&apos;re also looking for long-term foster, so fosters that can keep the dog for a few weeks, maybe a few months, or until that dog gets adopted,\" says Sanchez.\nNow if you foster one of these pups and fall in love with them, and you want to give them a forever home.\n\"We&apos;re going to do is we&apos;re going to celebrate that by doing a name your own price adoption fee. So if people want to adopt a pet for free, that&apos;s all you can. Or they can donate whatever they like,\" says Sanchez.\nAnd if you can&apos;t foster a pup but still want to help, you can.\n\"Things like blankets or sweaters for the dogs would be helpful. But we&apos;re also looking for, like, battery banks, generators, extension cables, things like that, so we can keep our kind of response supplies ready,\" says Sanchez.",

    "text": "[McKenna Golat](/staff/7534194001/mckenna-golat/) PORT HURON â€” Snowballs were flying over the weekend thanks to local kids looking for some winter fun. Gavin Tucker, 13, posted to Facebook on Friday that he and his friends were going to have a snowball fight the next day at Roosevelt Elementary School playground. The post was inviting other local kids to join in on the fun. About a dozen children were at the playground by 2 p.m. on Saturday. Some were engaged in the snowball fight, while other played on the play sets and built forts. Tucker said he and his friend, Allen Lloyd, 12, thought of the idea after playing outside the night before with a snowball maker. The two thought it would be fun to organize a bunch of people to have a giant snowball fight. \"I'm extremely proud of the turnout,\" Tucker said. \"I didn't care about how many people showed up. We just wanted to have some fun.\" Lloyd said he thought it was super cool that people came out to join them. After seeing the Facebook post, Nick and Emily Humphries decided to bring one of their sons and neighbor. They said they thought it was great to see that a kid organized a fun event and wanted to partake in the action. \"It seems like this doesn't happen as much anymore,\" Nick Humphries said. \"To see something like this be set up is awesome.\" Emily Humphries said it was especially nice to see that it was kids that organized it. She said it's great that kids are going outside rather than spending the entire day online. She said the only thing that would have made it better was more snow and less wind. The original Facebook post was asking for kids between the ages of 10 and 18 to join. After seeing the comments, Tucker updated the post to expand the age range to anyone under 25. He said this way, more people could join the fun. Tucker and Lloyd said they would like to organize more community snowball fights throughout the winter. Contact McKenna Golat at mgolat@gannett.com.

    "text": "- By [Vishal Pushkar](https://english.jagran.com/authors/vishal-pushkar) - Fri, 12 Jan 2024 02:42 PM (IST) - Source:JND Australian batter David Warner made a grand entrance at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) by landing in a helicopter on Saturday. The 37-year-old, fresh from attending his brother's wedding, touched down on the SCG outfield, gearing up to play a Big Bash League (BBL) match for Sydney Thunder. Check out the video here: Dave Warner.â€” KFC Big Bash League (@BBL) In a Helicopter. Arriving at the SCG. Here's how it happened. [@davidwarner31] [@ThunderBBL] [@scg] [#BBL13] [pic.twitter.com/v7QRCkauH5] [January 12, 2024] Warner recently concluded his illustrious Test career with a half-century against Pakistan at the SCG, leading Australia to a convincing win in the third Test. Despite retiring from ODIs, Warner remains committed to T20Is and continues to participate in various T20 leagues worldwide. Reports initially suggested the possibility of the helicopter landing in Allianz Stadium, adjacent to the SCG. However, Warner's grand entrance at the SCG took precedence, ensuring he landed before the broadcasters set up for the Sydney Thunder vs. Sydney Stars BBL game.

They must win their remaining three games and hope for specific results to go their way in the ongoing BBL season. Despite the team's position, Warner's commitment to T20 cricket remains evident, reflected in his recent two-year deal with Sydney Thunder.",

Stay inside when you can Most pets are susceptible to the cold and frostbite despite their fur.\nZiggy, a golden doodle dog plays in the snow in the aftermath of Winter Storm Jonas on January 24, 2016 in Melville, New York. (Credit: Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\nHOW TO PROTECT PETS IN EXTREME COLD, SNOW\n2. Check under the hood Cats find warm car engines very appealing at night.\nMake sure they aren’t hiding in your vehicle by banging on the hood or honking the horn.\n3. Give pets distinct collars Snow and ice can hide scents that help animals find their way home .\nMake sure that your pet has a distinct and labeled collar during the winter season.\n4. Check the paws From deicers to antifreeze, pets’ paws, feet, and bellies can become covered in this material that can make your pet sick when licked off the body.\nMake sure to wash/clean your pet after walks or put on pet shoes.\nKEEPING PETS SAFE: IS ICE MELT TOXIC TO DOGS?\n5. Do not overfeed your pet While it may be enticing to give your pet a few more calories to help them stay warm during the winter, be cautious of your pet&apos;s health .\nOverfeeding can lead to many health issues for animals .\n6. Keep up the humidity levels in your home According to the ASPCA, repeatedly coming out of the cold into the dry heat of your home can cause itchy, flaking skin.\nThey advise keeping your home humidified, and towel dry your pet as soon as they come inside -- especially the feet and between toes.\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n7. Bathe your pet as little as possible during cold snaps Your pets can develop dry, flaky skin they are washed too often, removing essential oils.\nMost of all, if it&apos;s too cold for you to be outside, it&apos;s too cold for your pet too, so keep them inside.\nFind more tips at the ASPCA and AMVA .\nFind more updates on this story at FOXWeather.com.",

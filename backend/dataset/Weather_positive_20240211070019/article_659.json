    "text": "It’s dumping at\nArapahoe Basin Ski Area, Colorado, with the resort seeing about a foot of the white fluffy stuff in the last 48 hours and more in the forecast. The past week has been just what the doctor ordered providing the Colorado ski resort with over two feet of snow and allowing it to open The Beavers and Pali terrain.\nA-Basin’s patrol team is working diligently to open more of the mountain as soon as possible, please keep an eye on the resort’s\nterrain status for real-time updates. As of Sunday, January 14, the resort has a base of 42 inches with 11 inches alone falling in the last 48 hours. Currently 32 out of 144 runs are open and six of the resort’s nine lifts are spinning.\nOn top of great snow, Arapahoe Basin Ski Area has plenty coming up on its events calendar, including the last two Rise n’ Shine Rando Races on\nJanuary 23, the famous Moonlight Dinners, and the NSAA Safety Village on January 27, just to mention a few events.\nRemember, A-Basin limits ticket sales every single day of the season to preserve the experience, so make sure to book online in advance to avoid disappointment. The resort has been limiting daily numbers to mitigate crowds, put less stress on the terrain, reduce parking issues, shorten lift lines, and keep A-Basin a beautiful, laid-back ski area with room on the slopes and a seat at the bar.",

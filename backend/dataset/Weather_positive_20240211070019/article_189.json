If you’ve never had this Russian retro dish, it’s a creamy beef and mushroom sauce served over noodles. It’s rich, hearty, and satisfying, layered with flavors and did I say SO creamy already? After one taste, you will see why Beef Stroganoff has been around for hundreds of years (one of the earliest versions was published in a Russian cookbook in 1871) and hopefully this Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff version will be passed down from generation to generation.\nTo modernize this Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff, I’ve eliminated commonly used mystery cream of mushroom soup, used my own blend of spices and made it less labor intensive by using the slow cooker.\nSo whether Beef Stroganoff is one of your favorite recipes or if you have never tried it or never made it before, you are going to be blown away at the ease and flavors of this Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff! If you love this Beef Stroganoff, you will also love my\nChicken Stroganoff for a budget friendly weeknight meal!\nBeef Stroganoff Recipe Ingredients\n- 2 lbs top sirloin cut into thin strips then 2” pieces\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1/2 teaspoon pepper\n- 1 large onion, chopped\n- 4-6 garlic cloves, minced\n- 10 oz. cremini mushrooms, sliced\n- 4 oz. cream cheese, softened **\n- 1/2 cup sour cream, room temperature **\n- 16 oz. egg noodles (or more if you love noodles)\nBeef Gravy Broth\n- 4 cups beef broth\n- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n- 1 tablespoon ketchup\n- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n- 1 tablespoon\nbeef bouillon(powder or base)\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons\nDijon mustard\n- 1 tsp EACH sugar, dried parsley, paprika\n- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1/4 tsp EACH dried thyme, red pepper flakes\nWhat is the best meat for stroganoff?\nThere are a few variations of Beef Stroganoff such as Beef Stroganoff with Meatballs and Beef Stroganoff with ground beef but the most common type of Beef Stroganoff is Beef Stroganoff with thinly sliced beef. When someone refers to Beef Stroganoff, they are referring to the latter and that is what we are making today.\n- Top Sirloin: I like to use top sirloin for Crock Pot Beef Storganoff because it is still economical but more tender than flank steak or other such cuts. It transforms into melt-in-your-mouth-tender when cooked in the slow cooker.\n- Rib Eye: You are also welcome to use more expensive rib eye as well. You can also use tougher cuts such as chuck roast or stew meat, just be aware you will likely have to cook your Crockpot Beef Storganoff for longer in order to tenderize the beef.\n- Ground Beef: You can also use lean ground beef but make sure to cook it before you add it to the crockpot and drain off the grease otherwise your stroganoff will be excessively greasy.\nTo thinly slice your top sirloin or rib eye, place it in the freezer for 30-60 minutes to firm up a bit. This allows you to slice the beef without it squirming beneath your knife. The beef will defrost quickly once you start slicing, so don’t worry about it being “frozen.”\nCan I Leave the Mushrooms Out?\nYes, you can certainly omit the mushrooms. You can also saute some mushrooms on the side and just add them to the portions of Beef Stroganoff for the mushroom lovers.\nYou can also add any additional vegetables you like such as carrots, potatoes, etc.\nCan I substitute the condensed cream of mushroom soup in this Beef Stroganoff Slow Cooker recipe?\nYes! Many Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff Recipes either call for cream of mushroom soup or a cornstarch slurry in order to thicken the sauce. In my experience, you cannot achieve the same creaminess by using this slurry method – it always ends up lacking. Instead we are going to make our own gravy and then add it to the slow cooker WITHOUT ANY cream of mushroom soup!\nDo I Have to Precook the Beef in this Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff Recipe?\nTraditionally, I recommend cooking beef before adding it to the slow cooker, but because we are slicing the meat so thin, it does not need to be precooked. If you are using ground beef, you will need to cook it first so you can drain off the excess grease.\nDO YOU USE SOUR CREAM OR CREAM CHEESE FOR CROCK POT BEEF STROGANOFF?\nWhen the meat is melt in your mouth tender, then you are ready to stir in some cream cheese until melted followed by sour cream for a wonderfully creamy mushroom, onion beef sauce. The cream cheese with the sour cream really really makes this sauce otherworldly divine and in turn this Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff otherworldy divine.\nCream cheese: In order for your cream cheese to not get lumpy, make sure it is quite soft. I cut it into pieces and soften it into the microwave – that way each piece is soft through and through and not just the outside. Take care you whisk your cream cheese so it fully melts. You can use low fat cream cheese but it will likely leave white speckles as it does not melt as well.\nSour cream: Your sour cream is less likely to curdle if it is at room temperature. You can use low fat sour cream but it will naturally not be as creamy and does not melt as well and tends to leave white speckles. It will still taste fine but just something to be aware of.\nHow to make Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff\nStep 1: While the beef is still on the cutting board, toss it with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Add meat, onions and garlic to slow cooker. You can add mushrooms now or halfway through cooking if you like firmer mushrooms (I add mine halfway through).\nStep 2: Whisk together flour, beef broth, a splash of Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and Dijon and some hand picked herbs and spices in a small saucepan and boil until it reaches gravy like consistency. It might appear on the thick side, but it will thin as moisture is released form the onions, mushrooms and meat in the slow cooker.\nStep 3: Add this Gravy Broth to your meat, onions, garlic and mushrooms (or for firmer mushrooms, reserve them until half way through cooking – that’s what I do) and cook until the meat is buttery tender and the tantalizing aroma fills your home with the robust flavors of creamy beefy heaven.\nHow long to cook Crockpot Beef Stroganoff\nCook your Crockpot Beef Stroganoff on HIGH 3-5 hours or on LOW for 7-9 hours. It is ready when the beef is melt-in-your-mouth tender.\nHow to make Crockpot Beef Stroganoff tender\nIf your beef isn’t tender, it means you just need to cook your Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff longer – even 30 minutes can make all the difference between tough and tender beef stroganoff.\nBeef Stroganoff Slow Cooker Tips for success\n- The meat is much easier to slice if placed in the freezer for 30-60 minutes to firm up. It will defrost quickly once you start slicing, so don’t worry about it being “frozen.”\n- You can substitute beef chuck roast for the top sirloin. Again, partially freeze before slicing.\n- The mushrooms are optional.\n- If you like melt-in-your mouth mushrooms then add them at the beginning of cooking. If you prefer firmer mushrooms then add them halfway through cooking.\n- I recommend full fat cream cheese as it is less likely to curdle.\n- Soften your cream cheese first otherwise it is much harder to fully dissolve and will leave lumps of cream cheese in the gravy.\n- Room temperature and full fat cream cheese is less likely to curdle.\n- The gravy should seem thick at first but will thin to the perfect consistency as moisture is released from the mushrooms, onions and meat.\n- Your beef is ready when it is melt in your mouth tender. If it is not tender, it just needs to cook longer. Even 30 minutes can make a big difference in tenderness.\n- Stir in additional sour cream if desired for more tangy sour cream taste.\nHow to store this Beef Stroganoff Crock Pot recipe\nYou can freeze Crockpot Beef Stroganoff but DON’T add the sour cream or cream cheese otherwise it will separate when reheated and the texture will be unpleasant. To Freeze:\n- Cook Crockpot Beef Stroganoff according to directions but do NOT add sour cream or cream cheese to Beef Stroganoff.\n- Let Stroganoff cool completely in the refrigerator.\n- Add Stroanoff to a a freezer safe container or freezer size bag.\n- When ready to eat, thaw overnight in the refrigerator.\n- Heat on LOW in the slow cooker for 1-2 hours or until warmed through on the stove.\n- Stir in cream cheese and sour cream.\nWhat to serve with this Beef Stroganoff Recipe\nThis Crock Pot Beef Stroganoff is not only delicious on egg noodles, but try it on\n mashed potatoes, baked potatoes and rice!\nAs far as sides, this Beef Stroganoff is delicious with:\nMoist Cornbreador Cornbread Muffins Soft and Fluffy Dinner Rolls Parmesans Breadsticks Roasted Carrots Roasted Broccoli Cheesy Pull Apart Pesto Bread Perfect Fruit Salador Winter Fruit Salad\n- Fall Salad, Apple Salad or Pear Salad\nWedge Salad with Blue Cheese Ranch\nWant to try this Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff?\nto your CROCK POT, MEAT, or DINNER Board to SAVE for later!\nFind me on Pinterest for more great recipes!

    "text": "Tesco has said it is temporarily accepting some smaller vegetables to help growers hit by recent storms and flooding. The supermarket is accepting slightly smaller [sprouts, cauliflowers, cabbages and leeks](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/) \"to help UK farmers struggling with the devastating weather conditions that have affected their livelihoods\". [Tesco ](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/tesco)said this applies to Northern Ireland stores.

A spokesperson added: \"In order to dry the wet sprouts Tesco worked with growers to develop a new innovative drying method, using cool air blowers to literally blow the water off them in their storage pallets.\" Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp [Click this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LU5TE4vC7DOJ3M6yruB11W) or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

    "text": "KATY, Texas – For Jeff Hajjar, making pizza is part of the family.\n“This used to be my dad’s. He opened it up in 1995 and I took it over in 2017. He got a little sick. He couldn’t manage it the way he wanted it too and I kept it going. Last year, my uncle Fuzzy who was the head honcho he’s the one that started Fuzzy’s, he passed away and one of the promises that I made to him was his wish of continuing Fuzzy’s Pizza,” he said.\nRELATED: Spectacular Saturday before our Arctic front arrives this weekend! The legacy continues to rise for Hajjar. He owns the Fuzzy’s Pizza store on Mason Road in Katy. He’s preparing to help the community in a big way ahead of the arctic blast.\nFuzzy's Pizza to stay open during freeze (Fuzzy's Pizza) “I’m not a fan of the cold but we are going to be open. Thankfully during the last freeze in 2021 we had power so we were open then and hopefully fingers crossed we will have power and be open too,” he said.\nRELATED: ERCOT issues Weather Watch ahead of extreme cold weather in SE Texas Customers love the idea.\n“That is a blessing that’s what that is. That’s amazing and it makes me want to come here even more and support them,” Carly Quintanilla said.\nRELATED: What is a ‘hard freeze’?❄️ There’s not much that can top this pizza lover’s dream.\n“We are opening up our dining room for people to come in and sleep, we will have the heaters on. We will have pizza and a little bit of a pizza party. It’s not going to be doom and gloom,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

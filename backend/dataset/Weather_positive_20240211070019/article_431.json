    "text": "NEW DELHI: In the frigid conditions of minus-4 degrees (felt like minus-27) at kickoff, the Kansas City Chiefs triumphed over the Miami Dolphins with a 26-7 victory in an AFC wild-card game on Saturday night. Patrick Mahomes played a crucial role, throwing for 262 yards and a touchdown, while Isiah Pacheco rushed for 89 yards and a score.Rashee Rice emerged as a standout performer for the Chiefs, catching eight passes for 130 yards and a touchdown, setting a franchise postseason record. Harrison Butker's accurate kicking was pivotal, as he made four field goals, contributing significantly to the Chiefs' victory.â€” Chiefs (@Chiefs) Despite the challenging weather conditions, Mahomes displayed resilience, completing 23 of 41 passes. The Chiefs' offense, combined with a determined defense, secured their sixth consecutive season with a playoff victory.Former Chiefs star Tyreek Hill made a noteworthy return to Kansas City, catching a 53-yard touchdown pass for the sixth-seeded Miami Dolphins. However, it wasn't enough to overcome the Chiefs' dominance.Tua Tagovailoa threw for 199 yards with one touchdown and one interception for the Dolphins, who have now lost six straight playoff games since their wild-card victory over the Indianapolis Colts in 2000.Raheem Mostert and Jaylen Waddle returned from injuries but weren't particularly effective for the Dolphins. Mostert rushed for 33 yards, while Waddle had two receptions for 31 yards.The game was characterized by challenging weather conditions, with the temperature dropping to minus-9 in the fourth quarter. Butker's precise field goals, combined with key plays from Mahomes and the Chiefs' offense, secured a commanding victory for Kansas City in their AFC wild-card matchup.(Inputs from Reuters)",

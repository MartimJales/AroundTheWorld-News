    "text": "MILWAKEE — A Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) bus driver helped a stranded driver get to work Friday morning as a major winter storm moved through the area.\nAccording to MCTS, Andre Clavelli was heading to work at about 7 a.m. when he lost traction and his car ended up in a snowbank.\nMORE COVERAGE: Forecast: Blizzard Conditions Possible Friday In Wisconsin Live Updates: Schools Close, Thousands Lose Power During Winter Storm \"While several cars and trucks passed by, with so many inches of snow and such slippery conditions, the other drivers didn’t stop,\" a news release shared by MCTS says.\nThat's when Clavelli went back into his car and called roadside assistance. Right as he was dialing, MCTS driver Deneen Tate, driving her BlueLine route, saw Clavelli and pulled over to help him.\nTogether, Tate and Clavelli were able to get the car back on the road - proving that it takes a village when a snow storm like this comes to Wisconsin.\n“I couldn’t do it myself. I am very lucky she was there to help me,\" Clavelli told MCTS. \"Truly blessed and thankful; God bless her. Her timing was perfect.\"\nBlizzard conditions will be possible Friday evening as temperatures drop and the snow becomes fluffier and lighter.\nWinds will gust near 40 to 45 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow reducing visibility. We're expecting a widespread 8-12\" of snowfall inland, with a narrow band of 12-14\" in some areas and 4-8\" immediately along Lake Michigan.",

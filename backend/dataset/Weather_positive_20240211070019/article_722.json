    "text": "The weather has been interesting for many of us this winter. Brutally cold winds forced Taylor Swift to pile on the layers while supporting her boyfriend Travis Kelce at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Miami Dolphins this past weekend. Meanwhile, strong Santa Ana winds forced Golden Globe winner Ali Wong to wear a wind-proof hairstyle for the big night.\nWith the weather so unpredictable, we are opting to spend more time indoors to steer clear of the plunging temperatures.

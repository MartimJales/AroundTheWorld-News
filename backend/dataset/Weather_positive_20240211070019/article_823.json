    "text": "January 15, 10 PM Weather Forecast Weather Alert ...LIGHT SNOW EXPECTED TONIGHT... A quick moving upper level weather system will bring upwards of one half of an inch to an inch of snow to parts of central Indiana through tomorrow morning. The best chances for higher snow totals will be over areas north and west of Indianapolis. These minor snow accumulations will accumulate on untreated surfaces, creating slippery conditions. Be prepared for minor snow accumulations if traveling as driving could be difficult. ...WIND CHILL ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON EST TUESDAY... * WHAT...Dangerously cold wind chills. Wind chills as low as near 25 below zero. * WHERE...Near and north of Interstate 70. * WHEN...Midnight tonight until Noon Tuesday. * IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... A Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds will combine to generate low wind chills. This will result in frostbite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not taken.

The Miracle Revival Church's goal is to protect those who are most vulnerable. Inside this church, there's a warming center and people who want to help. “We’ve had a mild winter, but it's about to get really bitter cold the next few days,” said Andrew Synder, the pastor at Miracle Revival Church. Temperatures will soon drop to single digits. That's why the city opens warming centers like the Charles Black Community Center, the O'Brien Center, and the Howard Park Event Center, but they fill fast. Pastor Snyder opened the basement of his church where people can go to keep warm. His goal is to help people with nowhere to go, escape the cold, offering things like clothing, blankets, shoes, and even food to those in need. \"There's a tremendous need, there's a lot of homeless people in South Bend and they need a place to come where it's warm, especially in the daytime, they go to the library, but sometimes it gets so cold, they close the library, we're just here to serve the community and do what we can to help people,” said Synder. The church is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 7 days a week.",

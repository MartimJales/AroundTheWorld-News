    "text": "News Editor for Townhall.com Katie Pavlich joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to give her take on how the low temperatures expected on Monday could impact turnout for the Iowa Caucuses. “It’s supposed to be -45 this weekend with the wind chill. And I’m going to Iowa on Sunday. And they’re like sending these emails that say dress warm, dress in layers. And I’m like, I have gear for cold weather. I do not have gear for Antarctica. Okay. So we’re going to do our best. But even people in Iowa who I know are saying, we deal with snow and cold, but -45 was wind chill is pretty tough. But at the same time, they worked really hard in these caucuses. They’re excited, raring to go. So you know there’s all a peer pressure there too. You know, because the caucuses are people getting together in gyms and community halls and these towns. And if someone wusses out because of the cold, they’ve got their Iowa hearty reputation on the line. Right? So I think people are probably pressuring each other to show up on Monday night. The honorary general in the “Failla Fashion Army” also congratulates your radio buddy on the launch of Fox News Saturday Night With Jimmy Failla, which premieres on January 13th at 10PM ET. Listen to the podcast to hear what else she had to say! PLUS, you can pre-order a copy of Jimmy’s new book now!

    "text": "Embrace the Cold for Winter Adventure\nAt the risk of being unpopular, I hope that by the time you are reading this story there is a formidable layer of snow pack on the ground and we are living in a certifiable winter wonderland.\nYes, not everyone loves the snow like I do (I am originally from the frozen tundra of Wisconsin, after all), but I feel sometimes that is just because people are afraid to go out in it. I think that if some folks bundled up and got out into the cold, they might realize that playing in the snow can make you feel like a kid again.\nRemember those days, building snowmen, sled riding, and coming home to hot cocoa? Well, I am telling you, no matter your age, those kinds of memories can be made again, because central Pennsylvania offers plenty of opportunity for winter adventures.\nFrom hiking to skiing to skating and more, you don’t want to miss out on all of the wintery fun that is out there. After all, what is the point of living somewhere that is cold (usually) at least three months of the year if we don’t embrace it, right?\nLet’s explore some of the opportunities available in Centre County:\nHitting the Trails\nThe trails are open year round for hiking and more, so don’t be afraid to use them, even in the cold. Always dress in layers, and, especially if you are new to winter excursions, go out with a buddy. Starting out, stick to well-known trails. Rothrock State Forest, Scotia, and Black Moshannon State Park offer plenty of options, as do other locations in the area.\nI am mostly a hiker, but I am always amazed when I see mountain bikers out on the snow-covered trails (fat tires are a must).\nSkis and snowshoes are another good option, and state parks often have rentals available for those looking to give it a whirl.\nSome winter trail tips:\n- Hike with a friend.\n- Stick to trails you know when starting out.\n- Beware of driving on snow-covered forest roads; the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources does not plow.\n- Traction devices are a must on steep and icy trails.\n- Don’t post hole (letting your legs sink deep in the snow with every step) on dedicated cross-country ski trails.\n- It gets dark early, so bring a light.\nSlide Down the Slopes of Tussey\nOf course, the first thing people around these parts think of when they think of outdoor winter activities is Tussey Mountain Resort. Centre County’s home slope is a great place to learn to ski and snowboard, and it is right in the Centre Region’s backyard.\nFirst-timers should consider a lesson and lots of practice on the bunny hill, because even though Tussey slopes are not that high compared to some others, they are steep. One thing for sure is that getting off the lift on top of the mountain and looking down at Happy Valley below is awesome (and maybe a little scary to newbies, like me).\nAnd if skiing and snowboarding aren’t for you, snow tubing is a less upright way to make your way down the slopes.\nDon’t forget to grab a warm (or cold) beverage in the lodge at the end of the day.\nSledding\nSome of my favorite memories from when my son was little were winter days spent at Slab Cabin Park, with a hot coffee in one hand and a sled in the other. When the snow falls, the sled hill is a favorite Centre Region spot that you don’t want to miss, with a fun atmosphere and a great hill.\nBald Eagle State Park also has a great sledding hill that is usually a little less busy, but just as much fun. All you have to do is bundle up and brave the climb back up the hill for more.\nSnowmobiling\nI have never used a snowmobile in my life, but boy do they look like fun, with the snow blowing behind you as you speed ahead. Along with dedicated snowmobile trails, many state forest roads are open to snowmobilers (check\nDCNR for open dates) as long as there is enough snow. There are groups dedicated to snowmobiling in different areas of the county, such as the Black Mo Snowmobile Club, that are good resources for those looking to get into this winter activity.\nIce Skating\nFrom community skating rinks in Bellefonte, Howard, and Boalsburg to our many state parks and indoors at Pegula Ice Arena, the ice skating options in Centre County are many.\nLet’s hope the weather cooperates this season for some outdoor skating, but in the meantime, Pegula is the perfect place to practice.\nFun in the Snow at Black Mo\nEvery year, Black Moshannon State Park offers a celebration of winter activities called\nFun in the Snow at Black Mo. The January 27 event is an opportunity to try ice skating, cross-country skiing, broomball, ice mini golf, curling, sledding, and snowshoeing. It is a fun time for the whole family. If there is no snow on the ground on the 27th, the makeup date is February 10. T&G\nVincent Corso loves exploring the outdoors in central Pennsylvania and beyond.",

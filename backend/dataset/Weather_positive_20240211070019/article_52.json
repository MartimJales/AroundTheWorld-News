    "text": "MERRIAM, Kan. (KCTV) - In response to the recent -- and upcoming -- freezing temperatures, the Great Plains SPCA is reminding pet owners of their effort to ensure the well-being of dogs that are typically kept outdoors.\nThe organization is offering specially curated winter care kits that include essential items to keep these dogs warm and comfortable, according to CEO Tam Singer.\n“They are just like us, they can get cold, they can get hypothermia, and they can actually die in arctic temperatures,” Singer said. “When a dog is tethered or chained outside, they’re unable to kind of find their natural ability to protect themselves.”\nThe care kits, provided free of charge, consist of crates equipped with toys, a leash, bedding, and treats. Additionally, the Great Plains SPCA is offering valuable tips and training to both pets and their owners, aiming to create a safer and more comfortable environment.\n“There are a lot of people that really do want to do the best by their pets,” Singer said. “Maybe they haven’t had the opportunity or the resources or the time and so reach out to us and we can help you – we want to help you.”\nYesterday alone, the organization distributed 35 of these kits to dog owners in need. However, despite these efforts, concerns were raised when KCTV5 discovered dogs still chained up outside during their drive around the area on a particularly cold Thursday.\nChaining dogs outside in freezing temperatures poses serious dangers, as the length of the chain limits the dog’s mobility. The Great Plains SPCA emphasizes the risks associated with such practices, stating that dogs may be unable to reach a warm spot if it’s too far away.\nThe organization also provides cat shelters for neighborhood cats.\n“We also offer insulated cat houses for those cats that are outside all the time,” Singer said.\nThe cat houses have hay inside them, and like the dog crates, they are free.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

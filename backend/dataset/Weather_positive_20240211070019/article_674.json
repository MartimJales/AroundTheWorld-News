On Wednesday, an air mass boundary will cause a division into two parts.\nMunich – Snow, frost and slippery conditions – this winter provides everything that makes up the season. Also in the third week of January. After the already spectacular start on Monday, Germany will even be divided into two by the weather on Wednesday.\nWeather in Germany: Snow showers will move through the country from the north on Monday For Dominik Jung, the first day of the week will be \"quite turbulent\". According to the graduate meteorologist and managing director of the weather service \"Q.met GmbH\", \"snow showers from the North Sea to the interior\" are to be expected. In addition, there are also short winter thunderstorms.\nAccording to the report, temperatures at low altitudes reach one to four degrees, which leads to \"wet and cold dirty weather\". On the other hand, above 300 or 400 meters there is light permafrost, which is why the snow remains on the ground. Jung explains: \"Ten to 15, sometimes 20 centimetres of snow are possible in the northern part of the low mountain ranges.\"\nThe German Weather Service (DWD) warns of snow and sleet showers with slippery conditions as well as some significant snowfall and snow drifts in the mountains. In addition, squalls are possible in the northeast, on the coasts and in the mountains. During the night it will continue to snow in some areas, in addition to frost and widespread slippery conditions.\nWalk in the snow: The white flakes are to be followed by a lot from above in the coming days. © IMAGO / Funke Foto Services\nWinter in Germany: Wednesday causes air mass boundary to divide the weather into two According to Jung, the values on Tuesday morning are between minus five and zero degrees. Widespread icy roads are to be expected. In the course of the day, temperatures will climb up to three degrees, with isolated snow showers only moving through the north.\nMy news Farmers announce the end of blockades Read\nClimax of the farmers' protests: \"Nothing works anymore\" – 10,000 participants at large demonstration in BerlinRead\n\"Sharp weather limit\" causes temperature change in Baden-WürttembergRead\nThree junctions of the Autobahn 24 already blockedread\nA native of Baden-Württemberg is the first and only \"Mister Olympia\"read\n\"There's still enough left\": Lotto millionaire Chico opens up about his current fortune read\nOverall, the weather situation calms down – only to pick up speed rapidly. \"On Wednesday, the air mass border, which has been announced for more than a week, will come to us in Germany. And that's when things really get going,\" Jung sums up.\nIn the north, the shivering continues at minus one to two degrees. The south is served nine to twelve degrees. \"It's going to be really mild,\" speculates the weather expert, referring to Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg & Co.\nSnow and rain in Germany: mild in the south and cold in other parts of the country Although it is not yet certain where exactly the air mass boundary will be, the values around the freezing point are expected to settle in this transition area. In the southwest, it will initially snow heavily, \"but behind it it will be much milder, partly freezing rain, freezing rain and then only rain, because the temperatures will rise significantly.\"\nThe snow is expected to fall as far as northern Rhineland-Palatinate. Accordingly, the south of North Rhine-Westphalia will also benefit from the white flakes, with the line then leading in the east to Saxony and the south of Brandenburg.\nJung emphasizes: \"Further south, we have some dangerous freezing rain, and that for several hours. Of course, this is a fire hazard for overhead lines, for power lines.\" The situation is different on the Upper Rhine, where ten to eleven degrees can be reached.\nThe DWD forecasts a \"pronounced severe weather situation with heavy snowfall over the centre and partly extreme black ice to the south\" for what is probably the most varied day of the week.\nSnow in almost all of Germany: The week starts really wintry. © IMAGO / Funke Foto Services\nLots of snowfall in Germany: In the southwest, rain can also turn into sleet According to Jung, however, the expected air mass limit will continue to have an impact after Wednesday. He warns: \"The night to Thursday will remain extremely dangerous, partly long-lasting heavy snowfall from Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia over to Saxony and Brandenburg.\" Temperatures are also falling again in the southwest, \"and then the rain can turn into sleet.\"\nBut that wasn't all. In the southern centre, it is expected to continue snowing at zero to two degrees. In the far south, on the other hand, the values rise again to ten to eleven degrees, which are not very wintery. However, it goes downhill again in the course of the day.\nFor the north, meanwhile, Thursday offers zero to three degrees. It's friendlier, even the sun could show up from time to time.\nCold weather in Germany: double-digit minus temperatures forecast for the start of the weekend In the night to Friday it is supposed to be \"partly bitterly cold\". In the middle, temperatures drop to as low as minus twelve degrees. The day itself is \"a bit more relaxed\". Temperatures around freezing point are expected, up to two degrees on the Upper Rhine, and even three or four degrees in the northwest.\nThe weekend will start really wintry, with temperatures down to minus 15 degrees Celsius in places. The values will rise to minus five to three degrees during the day on Saturday. Occasionally the sun appears.\nFor the following days, Jung expects \"a slight mitigation\". However, this is mainly accompanied by dense clouds. Zero to eight degrees are forecast for Sunday, minus one to six degrees for Monday.\nIn the new week, temperatures are expected to rise slowly. In addition, rain must be expected. (mg)",

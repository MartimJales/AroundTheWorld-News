    "text": "No matter how you look at it , we're in the middle of winter. On the bright side — literally — the days are getting longer, even though it may not feel like it right now. And don't forget, we have the arrival of daylight saving time coming in March. The increase in daylight hours comes in such small increments it doesn't seem as if anything changes but those minutes and seconds do add up. Between Jan. 1 and the end of the month Jan. 31, we'll see 30 extra minutes of daylight, according to calculations from the Old Farmers Almanac. And if you want to get really excited, between Jan. 1 and the summer solstice on June 20 — the longest day of the year — we'll have an extra 4 hours of daylight for Florida summer fun. These calculations were based on Jacksonville, in Northeast Florida. Daylight saving time begins at 2 a.m. EST Sunday, March 10, 2024, when we \"spring forward .\" Yes, we'll lose an hour of sleep. Those who support ending daylight saving time permanently advocate brighter afternoons and more economic activity. Likely the No. 1 complaint about daylight saving time is the disruption of sleep and habits. The winter solstice occurred Dec. 21 in 2023. Figures were calculated for Jacksonville. The summer solstice, or the longest day of the year, will be June 20 in 2024. Figures were calculated for Jacksonville. Over the course of a month, you'll have anywhere from an extra 10 to 20 minutes of new daylight hours. Here are a few ideas of what you can do with them:",

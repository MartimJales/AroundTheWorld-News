    "text": "Good morning, Cafe! Hope everyone is safe and well and warm! The cold weather is being downright mean to entirely too many of us, so please to get yourself a hot drink, something tasty and cuddle up to join us for a bit. All are welcome to join the fun, the silliness, the conversations. If you don‚Äôt know...just ask! Some things really do require a bit of explanation. There will be a few surprises along the way, all good ones, we hope. We are here to keep building the Daily Kos Community. We post Mon-Sun at 10:30 a.m. Eastern. Pie fights will be met with outrageous ridicule and insults. Trolls will be incinerated and served at the next group BBQ. As briquettes.

As a matter of fact, it was his storyline with Addie that I first remember. My mum started watching because Days came on right after the news at lunch time. Then, she had the nerve to get ME hooked on it! LOL We talked about it for years afterward, if I wasn‚Äôt working and had to miss it. Or, she‚Äôd watch it and bring me up to speed. Bill Hayes was the first to sing on a Soap, too!

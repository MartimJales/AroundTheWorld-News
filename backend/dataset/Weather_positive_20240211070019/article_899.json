    "text": "DGCA Issues SOPs to Airlines Amid Fog-Induced Disruptions at Delhi Airport\nColorado’s Animal Caretakers Stand Strong Against Harsh Cold\nAs Colorado grapples with plummeting temperatures, the state’s animal caretakers are going above and beyond to ensure the safety and well-being of their animals. From livestock owners to zookeepers, the fight against the harsh cold is a collective one, showcasing the dedication and resilience of those who care for the state’s diverse animal population.\nBraving the Cold: Livestock Owners Rise to the Challenge\nIn the face of the extreme cold, livestock owners are employing innovative methods to safeguard their animals. The Pendley family, who journeyed to the Stock Show in Colorado with their hogs, utilized heaters and enriched bedding to maintain warmth. Kade Pendley acknowledged that while hogs have natural fat reserves to combat the cold, extreme conditions still pose a significant challenge.\nEqually vigilant, Darylea Dory and her mother, who arrived to showcase their calves, underscored the critical role of dryness in preventing illnesses like pneumonia. To achieve this, they employed a large blow-dryer, ensuring the calves were dried quickly and efficiently.\nDenver Zoo Adapts to the Cold\nAt the Denver Zoo, similar steps are being taken to protect the resident species. Many animals are being relocated to indoor habitats, an effective strategy to shield them from the harsh outdoor conditions. But the focus isn’t solely on physical well-being. Jake Kubie of the Denver Zoo emphasized the importance of providing enrichment and mental stimulation to keep the animals engaged during the cold weather closure.\nCommunity Efforts to Safeguard Pets\nEven as livestock and zoo animals are receiving specialized care, community organizations are stepping up to safeguard smaller pets. The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region is sharing vital tips to ensure the well-being of pets like cats and dogs in frigid temperatures. These include understanding your pet’s tolerance to the cold and being mindful of stray animals that might be seeking warmth. Elite Equine Rescue and Rehab, a non-profit caring for neglected or abused performance horses, is also appealing for volunteers and donations to bolster their efforts in the face of the extreme cold.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/sports/craig-youth-hockey-associations-18u-team-achieves-back-to-back-victories-amidst-senior-night-festivities/ []https://bnnbreaking.com/breaking-news/health/revolutionary-healthy-smiles-healthy-hearts-initiative-launched-by-american-heart-association-and-delta-dental/",

    "text": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The extreme winter weather could only delay the celebration for the\n[Buffalo Bills](/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills).\nKicking off 27-plus hours later than originally scheduled at Highmark Stadium, the Bills made up for lost time by beating the\n[Pittsburgh Steelers](/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers) [31-17](/nfl/game/_/gameId/401547751) in an AFC wild-card matchup that extended Buffalo's win streak to six games.\nBuffalo quarterback\nJosh Allen threw first-quarter touchdown passes to tight ends Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid. Allen added a personal record 52-yard touchdown run in the second quarter to stake the Bills to a 21-0 lead, one they would not relinquish.\nThe Steelers, meanwhile, saw their unlikely late-season push end amid Allen's big plays and their own turnovers. Pittsburgh, which was playing without All-Pro pass-rusher\nT.J. Watt, reached the postseason despite possessing a 4% chance of making the playoffs on Dec. 22.\nHere's a look at the top storylines for both teams in Monday's matchup:\nBuffalo Bills\nDealing with a variety of defensive injuries as the Steelers got the game to within one score early in the fourth quarter, the ball was in quarterback Josh Allen's hands to put together a drive and pull ahead.\nKhalil Shakir, who managed to somehow find his way out of an attempted tackle by safety Minkah Fitzpatrick downfield and ran past other Steelers defenders into the end zone with 6:27 remaining.\nThe score punctuated a 31-17 win for the Bills in which the team took advantage of miscues by the Steelers and found cohesion on offense, with Allen completing 21 of 30 passes for 203 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran for 74 yards and one score on eight carries.\nIt was Allen's fourth career playoff game with three passing touchdowns, passing\nJim Kelly for the most in Bills postseason history. It was only the second time since Week 4 that Allen did not turn the ball over.\nNext up for the Bills will be a\n[Kansas City Chiefs](/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs) team led by Patrick Mahomes in his first career road playoff game.\nDescribe the game in two words: Step one. Winning in the wild-card round is a step in the right direction for a team with the biggest of goals, and while it wasn't a perfect performance -- the theme of the Bills' season -- a strong start led to Buffalo advancing to the next round.\nQB breakdown: Allen posted an impressive all-around effort, but his 52-yard record-breaking touchdown run deserves a shoutout of its own. On a third-and-8 play, Allen darted past and through defenders to score the Bills' third touchdown of the day despite safety\nDamontae Kazee making contact to try to bring him down. The run was the second-longest rushing touchdown by a quarterback in postseason history and the longest rushing score in Bills postseason history.\nPivotal play:\nKaiir Elam's interception in the second quarter. The Steelers were primed to score on Pittsburgh's fifth drive of the game. Backup cornerback Elam came in during the drive for Christian Benford (knee) and was run over on a 12-yard pass to tight end Pat Freiermuth then was called for defensive pass interference two plays later. Two plays after that, Elam redeemed himself and picked off a Mason Rudolph pass in the end zone to keep the Bills up two scores and the Steelers scoreless.\nTroubling trend: Defensive injuries. With the return of defensive tackle\nDaQuan Jones late in the season, the health of the Bills' D seemed to be looking up. Then starting cornerback Rasul Douglas, outside linebacker Tyrel Dodson and safety Taylor Rapp were hurt in Week 18 and missed the start to the playoffs. And in Monday's contest, starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard (ankle) was carted off and linebacker Baylon Spector (back) and cornerback Christian Benford (knee) both exited. Nickel corner Taron Johnson also left to be evaluated for a head injury. With a short week, the number of defensive injuries could take a significant toll. -- Alaina Getzenberg\nNext game: vs. Chiefs (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)\nPittsburgh Steelers\nCompeting without NFL Defensive Player of the Year contender\nT.J. Watt, the Steelers battled back from a 21-0 hole, but they fell short, putting an end to their season in the wild-card round. The Steelers are now winless in their past four playoff appearances, last winning against the Chiefs in the 2016 divisional round.\nThe Steelers, playing a day later than originally scheduled because of a winter storm in the area, fell behind 14-0 after one quarter, as their mistakes were compounded by the Bills' dazzling playmaking. Yet in a microcosm of their season, the Steelers didn't give up and fought to make it a one-score game early in the fourth quarter, before\nhttps://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17102/josh-allen and the Bills' offense carved up Pittsburgh's depleted defense.\nWith the loss, the Steelers have reached a crossroads and an offseason full of choices that could alter the course of the franchise. Will they commit to\nKenny Pickett as their starting quarterback in 2024? Will coach Mike Tomlin, currently under contract through the 2024 season, return? The clock on those decisions starts now.\nPivotal play: Trailing 14-0, the Steelers had their best opportunity to score from the 4-yard line early in the second quarter. Instead, they came away with zero points after\nKaiir Elam picked off Mason Rudolph as Elam dove in front of Diontae Johnson in the end zone to nab the ball. On the ensuing drive, the Bills went up 21-0 on a 52-yard https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen touchdown run. That the Steelers even got within a sniff of the end zone was a feat after gaining just 34 yards on their first four drives. Their fifth drive went 88 yards before Rudolph's errant throw in the end zone.\nQB breakdown: Making his fourth consecutive start -- and the first of his career in the postseason -- Rudolph performed better than his stat line suggests. He completed 22 of 39 passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns with the one interception, but the most impressive thing about Rudolph was the poise he showed in high-pressure moments.\nOn multiple occasions, Rudolph stood tall in the face of pressure, delivering strikes from the pocket as the Bills' pass rush closed in. In the third quarter, Rudolph climbed the pocket, dancing away from pressure, and threw across his body to hit\nGeorge Pickens over the middle for a 19-yard gain on third-and-long. The signal-caller capped that drive with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Austin III to make it a one-score game early in the fourth quarter.\nRudolph's confident and consistent play puts the Steelers in an awkward position. A new offensive coordinator is atop the list of Steelers' offseason priorities, but did Rudolph do enough to challenge Pickett for the starting job? Does Rudolph, not under contract for 2024, want to return to Pittsburgh or go somewhere else where he has a better shot at a starting job?\nSilver lining: Rookie outside linebacker\nNick Herbig has the makings of the Steelers' next defensive star. With Watt out, Herbig had a bigger than usual role on the defense. But his most impressive play came on special teams, as he hustled down the field to recover the ball following a blocked field goal by Montravius Adams. Thanks to Herbig's heads-up effort, the Steelers got their first points of the day on a short-field drive, capped by a 10-yard Rudolph-to-Johnson touchdown just before halftime. -- Brooke Pryor",

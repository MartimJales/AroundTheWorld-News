    "text": "BILLINGS, Mt: Among several school closures across Montana, Billings Public School (SD2) is choosing to maintain regular school operations on Friday using cold weather protocols. School District 2 officials said they are closely monitoring the weather; however, their intention is to maintain regular school hours for students. They took to their Facebook page on Thursday to share that the elementary and middle schools are going to follow standard start and end times. High schools will observe early dismissals due to semester exams as previously scheduled. On Monday, January 15th, SD2 will have a non-school day for students as their staff will be engaged in professional development activities. Billings Public School emphasized that the safety of their students and staff remains their top priority, so they will be closely monitoring the weather conditions for any update to school operations. Any updated information about school closures will be communicated through their website and Facebook posts.",

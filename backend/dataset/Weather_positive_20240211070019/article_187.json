    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — Due to the colder weather Columbus is experiencing, the Community Shelter Board has opened nine shelters to provide a safe environment to those who need it.\nView a list of daytime warming stations here .\nIn addition, the Community Shelther Board gave these facts and resources to Spectrum News 1:\nNine shelters are geographically disbursed across Columbus to provide 24/7/365 response to individuals and families experiencing homelessness, providing a safe and dignified environment to meet their immediate needs and connect them with resources to regain housing stability. Working in system congruency – dedicated, around-the-clock shelter staff act as first responders, providing intake for community members, navigating housing options, and keeping men, women, and families safe every single day and night of the year. The 24-hour homeless hotline answers 10,000-plus calls a year to connect people to shelter beds or help them find better options than shelter. On any given night this winter, there are more than 1,200 people sleeping in Columbus shelters. 7,800 people slept in homeless shelters last year — 1,900 of them were children. Homeless shelters and warming stations play a crucial role in providing a lifeline to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. They offer a refuge from the extreme weather conditions, protecting vulnerable individuals from life-threatening exposure to cold temperatures, frostbite and hypothermia. If you need access to an overnight shelter in Columbus, please call the centralized homeless hotline at 614-274-7000. This was a preliminarily conversation can be had and the needs of the person can be met. Please do not hesitate to call if needed. No one will be turned down.

    "text": "(WBBM NEWSRADIO) — A Decatur family has been reunited with their cat after it escaped from a truck — and was found over 1,000 miles away. Chad McIntyre, a truck driver, would bring the cat, named Tyler, with him on the road for company. “He had been a great companion for a little over a month that I had him on the truck,” McIntyre told CBS Champaign . “He’s a very well-traveled cat. He’s been in, I would say 20 of the 48 lower states.” McIntyre and Tyler were at a truck stop in Nevada when the cat escaped. He told the CBS station that he felt horrible, but he had to get back on the road. Back at home, his wife Brandi called the microchip company and discovered that Tyler was in a shelter in Wyoming — nearly 700 miles from where he disappeared. They figure the cat got into another truck before ending up in the shelter. How the cat got back is a story all on its own. The shelter arranged for volunteers to drive the cat back across the country, with several people doing different legs of the trip. Said Brandi McIntyre: “Now, he’s grounded. He’s not going back in the truck.” Listen to our new podcast Looped In: Chicago\nListen to WBBM Newsradio now on Audacy!\nSign up and follow WBBM Newsradio\nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram",

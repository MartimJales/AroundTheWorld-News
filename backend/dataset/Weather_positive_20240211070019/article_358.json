The question: Where can I go sledding? 24RHEIN gives an overview of the toboggan runs.\nCologne – The new year starts frosty and bitterly cold. For days, an official warning of frost and slippery roads has been in effect throughout North Rhine-Westphalia. In some parts of NRW there may also be snow. For many, this means unpacking their sleds and getting out into the fresh air. In NRW there are numerous toboggan runs for this purpose. In addition to the Bergisches Land and the Eifel, there are also slopes in the Ruhr area and Rhineland. Depending on the weather, it is possible to toboggan in various places – provided there is enough snow.\nTobogganing NRW: These toboggan runs are available It could snow again: There are numerous toboggan runs in NRW.

    "text": "PHOENIX â€” After a cold and wet start to the month, we are finally warming up this week. Our Valley forecast stays dry in the Valley Sunday but we could see a few more light snow showers in the four corners' area on Sunday. Buffalo Pass could get two to three inches of new snow. Overnight temperatures will remain in the upper 30s to low 40s in the Valley for another night or two before warming up into the 50s by the end next week. Expect afternoon highs back in the mid to upper 60s in Phoenix on Sunday and MLK Day. Later in the week as high pressure returns to the region, Phoenix could see temperatures back in the 70s for the first time this year.

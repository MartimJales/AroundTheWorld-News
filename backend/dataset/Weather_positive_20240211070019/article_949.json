    "text": "Mauritius lifts maximum cyclone alert\nMauritius lifted its maximum cyclone alert on Tuesday after assessing the impact of tropical storm Belal on the Indian Ocean island.\nThe storm claimed one life, left thousands without power, and caused widespread traffic disruption.\nThe Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) replaced the alert with a “safety bulletin” following the earlier elevation to the maximum level four alert.\nPreviously, the government had imposed an indoor stay order on Monday, which was later eased by the MMS, advising people to exercise caution and seek safe places.\nThe National Emergency Operations Command warned of winds up to 80 km/h and waves of seven meters, heightening flood risks in low-altitude regions.\nPrime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth criticized the meteorological agency for inadequate predictions, expressing surprise at the lack of anticipation for heavy rains.\nThe MMS director resigned following the incident.\nCyclone Belal had previously impacted the French overseas territory of Reunion, causing one fatality.",

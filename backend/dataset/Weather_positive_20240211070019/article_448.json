    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs advance past the Miami Dolphins in freezing conditions A matchup between the Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers in Buffalo was rescheduled to Monday due to a potentially dangerous snowstorm. The Kansas City Chiefs outlasted the Miami Dolphins in freezing conditions to take a step towards a fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years. With the temperature at a near-NFL-record low of minus 20C, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was instrumental in leading his side to a dominant 26-7 victory. Mahomes threw for 262 yards and a touchdown without turning the ball over on a night where rushing was the focal point of Kansas Cityâ€™s offence. The strategy paid off as the Chiefs opened the scoring in the first few minutes and stayed in front from there. An injury-depleted Miami was far from their high-scoring best, finishing with just 264 total yards as the Dolphins remain without a play off victory since 2000. The cold weather wreaked havoc across the first day of the super wild card round, with the matchup between the Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers in Buffalo being rescheduled to Monday due to a potentially dangerous snowstorm. Elsewhere, CJ Stroud threw for three touchdowns as the Houston Texans demolished the Cleveland Browns 45-14. Stroud racked up 274 yards in the air without a turnover, while Browns quarterback Joe Flacco was picked off twice in the heavy loss.",

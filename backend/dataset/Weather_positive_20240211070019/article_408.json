    "text": "Regina’s Mamaweyatitan Centre marked Family Fun Day, despite -30 temperatures in the city, with the help of the Roughrider foundation.\nFamily Fun Day at the centre is just one of many events that aim to bring the community together, regardless of conditions outside.\n“Honestly this morning when I got out of my car in -50, I was like ‘no one’s going to come’ and we’ve already got 100 people so it’s great,” said Megan Stecyk, librarian at the centre. “Winter’s a terrible time and you need something fun to look forward to.”\nGet the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. Prize giveaways, face painting, button making, balloon animals, visits from the Roughriders were all on the list of things to do at Family Fun Day, topped off with a hot chilli lunch.\nThe food was sponsored by the Roughrider foundation, whose executive director, Cindy Fuchs, said they were proud to help bring some joy to the community on such a cold weekend.\nTrending Now Ancient ‘lost valley of cities’ found in Amazon rainforest Canadians brace for another winter storm.

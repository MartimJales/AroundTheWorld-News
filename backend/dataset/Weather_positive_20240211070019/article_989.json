    "text": "The Salvation Army in Wheeling is looking to battle the cold by opening its shelter during the day to keep people warm. \"We're already talking about a class of people that are not in good health to begin with, so when something like this happens, it can be deadly, literally,\" said Lt. John Lawrence, corps officer, Salvation Army. The shelter will remain open during the day while the temperature is below freezing. The Salvation Army also partnered with Wheeling Subaru and Operation Warm for a children's shoe drive so they can stay warm and involved this winter. \"The shoe is that extra step,” Lawrence said. “I don't know about you, but when I was a kid and I got a new pair of shoes, you got excited going to school in your new shoes.\" Operation Warm and Wheeling Subaru donated 120 athletic shoes for children to use throughout the year. Anyone looking to register for size and pickup can call the Salvation Army (304-233-4400) and a pickup date will be given. \"It puts a smile on a kid’s face,” Lawrence said. “And so often kids’ feet are not taken care of throughout the year. Giving them a quality pair of shoes will not only put that smile on their face. But also help them take care of their health as well as participation in activities with other children.\" The Salvation Army is still accepting applications for Operation Warm.",

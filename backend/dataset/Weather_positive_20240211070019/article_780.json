    "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Monday's weather falling on a federal holiday did not keep kids from having a snow day. Sounds of laughter filled the frigid air near the Clinton Presidential Library as dozens spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday out on sleds, or in some cases— pool inflatables and cardboard. \"We have a big avocado here, soon-to-be ruptured pool toys, and a broken donut,\" said sledders Isabella Branton, Peter Branton, and Andrea Flores Ruz. No matter what they used to slide on, these families went to make some fun snow day memories and they even brought four-legged friends. For many people, the Clinton Library is a go-to spot when there's snow outside. \"We come every time we can. So I think it's like number four or five. Like enough snow to come out,\" Symone Blagg said. The bitter cold didn't stop Blagg from enjoying her day. In fact, she said she didn't feel it. \"I'm very hot. Like I've got on enough clothes that I could I could take a layer off. I'm sweating,\" she explained. Blagg said this snow is different than previous ones because it's much drier and that makes a big difference on the sleds. \"This dry snow like you get stuck a lot more. If it's like wet or more slippery, you can go further faster,\" Blagg added. Regardless of speed, she and her kids went for a good time, not a long time. \"It doesn't happen too often, but we do like the snow and snow days,\" Flores Ruz said.",

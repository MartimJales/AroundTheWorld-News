    "text": "Buffalo is known as the city of good neighbors for a reason.\nBuffalo is currently dealing with lake effect snow and strong winds that are producing a blizzard like conditions. The weather has led to a travel ban in the area and has pushed the Buffalo Bills’ Super Wild Card Weekend matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers to Monday afternoon at 4:30 p.m.\nDespite there being a travel ban in place, one motorist in Orchard Park was out on the road on Sunday. The driver could have been an essential worker trying to get to their place of work, but they suddenly became stranded. Luckily for the resident, two Bills players saw the vehicle and were able to get them back on the road.\nOffensive tackle Ryan Van Demark shared a video on his Instagram story showing Alec Anderson helping the vehicle out.\n“Good samaritan, Alec. Helping the people,” Van Demark says during the video.\nYou can also hear Anderson telling the driver that he’s good to go.\nThe motorist was lucky to have Anderson and Van Demark in the area as the storm was expected to be at its worst early on Sunday afternoon.\n“The bull’s-eye of the storm is predicted to hit midday Sunday afternoon,” Gov. Kathy Hochul stated on Saturday.\nIn addition to the most intense lake effect snow bands and wind, the wind chill could fall to five degrees on Sunday afternoon.\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

    "text": "The sub-zero temperatures and low wind speeds have finally forced Lake Mendota to relent.\nFor what seemed like an eternity for those who fish, ice boat and kite ski, the\nState Climatology Office has declared that the 9,781-acre lake was deemed officially frozen as of Monday, according to a release from the Madison-based Clean Lakes Alliance.\nWhile there could still be some open water spots on the lake, particularly in the lake's west basin, which had several open spots on Monday afternoon, officials at climatology use a guideline from the 1850s: whether one can row a boat from Picnic Point to Maple Bluff.\nThis year's freeze up is the third latest in over 170 years and comes 26 days after Dec. 20, the median ice-on date. It's also three weeks later than last season's freeze date. The latest date ice-on has been declared is January 30th, and that took place in 1932.\nThe earliest ice-out date for Lake Mendota is Feb. 27, set in 2002. The latest is May 6, set in 1857.\nHowever, just because the lake has frozen over, doesn't mean it's safe for travel. The state Department of Natural Resources says no ice is ever safe and that for those venturing out they should follow some basic safety guidelines. They remind people to dress warmly in layers; not to go out on the ice alone,; carry a cell phone in a plastic baggy or water-proof case; not to travel in areas you are not familiar and to not travel at night or during reduced visibility.\nLake users should also avoid inlets, outlets or narrows that may have current that can thin the ice; look for clear ice, which is generally stronger than ice with snow on it or bubbles in it; and carry basic safety gear like ice claws or picks, a life jacket and length of rope.\nThis also the 12th season in a row that the Clean Lakes Alliance has held its annual Mendota Freeze Contest, in which it asks people to guess when the lake would officially freeze. Of the 2,100 people to enter the contest, 88 people guessed Jan. 15. Kathleen Maier of Madison, who was randomly selected as the winner, said she picked the 15th because it is a family member’s birthday. Maier receives a $1,000 gift card courtesy of Lands’ End as the grand prize.\nThe freeze is also good news for the Clean Lakes Alliance’s popular\nFrozen Assets 5K Run/Walk on Feb. 3. As of Tuesday, the event was still on.",

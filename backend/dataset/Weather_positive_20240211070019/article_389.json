Those without a home may face bitter cold. But shelter is available for those who may need it at places like the Salvation Army. “Well, we have the shelter open and we have stuff warm for the guys to come in and get,” said Valerie Glover, Laurel Salvation Army program coordinator. “We keep the shelter open when it’s 32 (degrees) or below out. So, they can come in and kinda cozy up, watch TV, get something warm to eat, get something warm to drink and just be in out the weather.” The Slavation Army works closely with area emergency management centers to monitor the weather and provide shelter. “If it’s something that the (Emergency Operations Center) needs or if they want to know if our shelter is open, we work close together,” Glover said. Bridge to Hope President Cindy McLauchlin works with the homeless to help get them shelter. “We have anywhere from eight to 10 people who are sleeping in tents out in the weather.” McLauchlin said. Glover said the work is near and ear to her heart, helping those struggling or needing help. “I can just put myself in their shoes, thinking ‘What if it was me?’ And it’s very important that they have somewhere to go.” Right now, donations of winter clothing and blankets are needed.

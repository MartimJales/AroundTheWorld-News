    "text": "Deputies respond to woman in labor during blizzard conditions On Saturday night at approximately 11:20 p.m., Marshall County deputies and first responders were dispatched to 1359 Binford Ave. near St. Anthony for a report of a female having contractions. Due to weather and road conditions, the responding deputy and first responders were unable to reach the home, according to a press release. The deputy continued to respond by walking a half mile to the residence as the female remained online with the Marshall County Communications Center. Marshall County Secondary Roads and the Iowa Department of Transportation were contacted to clear the drifted roads for emergency responders to reach the residence. The Clemons Fire Department was able to utilize a tractor to clear a path for UnityPoint Health Ambulance. At approximately 12:38 a.m., the pregnant female gave birth. The female and baby were transported to UnityPoint Health. Names and conditions are not being released at this time. The Marshall County Sheriff’s Office was assisted by Marshall County Communications Center — Emergency Medical Dispatch, Clemons Fire Department, UnityPoint Heath — Marshalltown Ambulance, Marshall County Secondary Roads Department, and the Iowa Department of Transportation. For more information, please contact Sheriff Joel Phillips by calling 641-754-6380 or via email at sheriff@marshallcountyia.gov.",

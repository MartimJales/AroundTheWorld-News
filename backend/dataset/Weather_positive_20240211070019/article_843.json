    "text": "{h2}Perfect day for MLK Day, cold blast moves in for Tuesday{br}{/h2}{p}Beautiful day for MLK Day! Temperatures will be in thew 60s by the afternoon with sunny skies. Our next weathermaker brings big changes by tonight. An Arctic front moves in Monday night - Tuesday morning. Some wintry mix is possible across SW Alabama. Counties west of I-65 are under Winter Weather Advisory for light freezing rain. Ice accumulation of less than 1/10th of an inch is possible. Some overpasses and overhead surfaces could have a light glaze of ice in Alabama. Some wintry mix could fall in Northwest Florida, but accumulation is not expected due to warmer temperatures. We're mostly expecting showers.{/p}{p}This Tuesday cold front will be one of the stronger fronts of the season. It's coming from the Arctic and will have a big impact on our weather Tuesday - Wednesday. Highs will only be in the 40s on Tuesday afternoon, wind chill values near freezing. Temperatures will drop into the teens and 20s overnight - Wednesday morning. Wind chill values Wednesday morning could be into the single digits. Highs on Wednesday continue in the lower-40s. A hard freeze is in effect for Tuesday night - Wednesday morning and is something you should prepare for. Set indoor faucets to a drip and make sure outdoor pipes are insulated. Have a plan for your pets & outdoor plants.{/p}{p}Temperatures return to the 50s and 60s for Thursday & Friday. Some rain is possible Friday ahead of another strong cold front. Stay tuned!{/p}{p}{strong}Meteorologist Kelly Foster{/strong}{br}{/p}{p}NBC 15-area forecasts from the National Weather Service - {a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/marine\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/marine",

    "text": "Kempton Tips: D’Orhy the pick for classy Silviniaco Conti Chase\nI can't believe I'm saying this given the amount of weather-related abandonments recently, but it's currently Good to Soft (Good in places) on the Chase Course and Good to Soft (Soft in places) on the Hurdle Course ahead of Kempton's seven-race meeting on Saturday.\nOne of the highlights on the card is a classy renewal of the G2 Silviniaco Conti Chase - and the first of my two selections comes in that very spectacle.\n14:07 - Pic D'Orhy @\n11/4\nThere may only be five runners, but this renewal of the G2 Silviniaco Conti Chase is top-class.\nFirst and foremost, I want to oppose Joseph Patrick O'Brien's Banbridge. He's the unexposed type in the field, but ultimately he's yet to achieve anything that compares to the form of the three older horses - and maybe even Notlongtillmay - and doesn't deserve to be favourite in my book.\nEdwardstone ought to make a bold bid as he steps up in trip for the first time over fences, but I'm backing Pic D'Orhy to go back-to-back.\nPaul Nicholls' nine-year-old won this race last year - admittedly a much weaker event - by 16 lengths and warmed up for his defence with a triumph by the same margin in the 1965 Chase at Ascot that Shishkin famously refused to contest.\nKempton is a track he excels at, he will cope with the unexpected conditions better than most and Nicholls reckons this is his best chance of a winner on the day.\nDespite conceding three and six pounds to Banbridge and Notlongtillmay respectively, I think he's got an excellent chance of extending his impressive record in open chases to six wins from seven starts.\n15:50 - Rare Edition @\n10/11\nThe final race on the card is a 0-140 handicap hurdle over two miles - and this time I'm siding with the favourite Rare Edition.\nCharlie Longsdon's seven-year-old made a pleasing return from a 246-day layoff when a fast-finishing third in a competitive heat at Doncaster in mid-December, which resulted in no change to his mark of 136.\nProviding he improves as expected for the run, he could prove much too good for this modest-enough field off that rating.\nReturning to Kempton - the scene of his seven-length demolition of the now 149-rated Rubaud last season - and the booking of the brilliant Harry Cobden are two more positives, so it's fair to say he has plenty going for him here.",

    "text": "The night-time footraces of the Run 7-Eleven 2024 have attracted some 40,000-plus participants. The cool evening weather is expected to boost runners when competitions begin at 10 p.m. in the cities of Manila, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro on Feb. 3. Familiar faces like Richard Salano, Jeson Agravante, Mary Joy Tabal, Christine Hallasgo, Nhea Anne Barcenas are expected to return and grace the various distance events of the weekend meet as they seek out podium finishes. Last year, Salano and Agravante took the top honors in the men’s and women’s 21-km run of the Manila leg, while Hallasgo ruled the women’s 21-km event in Davao City. In Cebu, Rio de Janeiro Olympian Mary Joy Tabal marked her return to running from marriage and motherhood, with a third-place finish to winner Asia Paraase and Jeanly Mata in the women’s 16-km run. “We have been doing this for the longest time. And it’s really been a privilege for the 7-Eleven Run Series to be part of Manila, the heart of where everything started,” said Jose “Jun” Ang, Jr., the Division Head of General Merchandising of Philippine 7-Eleven Corporation, chief organizer of the race, which is on its 12th year. The refreshing conditions of the evening are favorable to the runners, who will have a chance to go around the routes with a better pace, according to organizers, who discussed the mechanics of races during the event’s launch on Friday at the Aristrocrat Restaurant in Malate, Manila Cash prizes will be at stake to the overall winners of the men’s and women’s 42-km run, the men’s and women’s 21-km events, along with the top finishers of the men’s and women’s 32-km action. The podium finishers will also be given a chance to join in top-notch running events around the Southeast Asian region. Organizers said they have achieved success in their registrations, with 25,000 participants already confirmed in the City of Manila, while 8,000 are set to compete in Iloilo, and 7,000 are joining in Cagayan de Oro. The winners in the 42-km marathon will get P25,000, while the top notchers in the 32-km category will receive P22,000. The champions of the 21-km action will be given P20,000.",

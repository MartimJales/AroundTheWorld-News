    "text": "Bristol City Confirms Loan Signing of Scott Twine from Burnley\nAmazon’s Rechargeable Heated Socks: A ‘Game Changer’ for Parents in Cold Weather\nWith the chill of winter biting, parents across the globe have found a warming ally in the form of rechargeable heated socks available on Amazon. These innovative foot warmers have become a hot topic on social media as they offer a convenient and cost-effective solution for those braving the cold to cheer on their children’s outdoor sports activities.\nA Game Changer in Cold Weather\nThe socks, hailed as ‘game changers’ and ‘life-changing’ by users, are equipped with built-in heating elements that promise to encapsulate your feet in warmth. They are designed to withstand a variety of outdoor activities, making them popular choices for football and rugby matches, skiing trips, and hiking adventures. With prices ranging between £18 and £25, they are an accessible option for those seeking respite from the cold.\nWarmth That Lasts\nThe rechargeable heated socks are not just about immediate comfort. They offer a battery life that varies between four and nine hours, ensuring prolonged warmth during those lengthy sports matches or extended outdoor excursions. The socks are also machine washable once the battery is removed, making them a practical choice for regular use.\nMore Ways to Keep Warm\nWhile the heated socks have been stealing the spotlight, they aren’t the only cost-effective warming items being discussed among parents. Hand warmers costing as little as 34p from B&M and hot water bottles have also been suggested as portable and reusable sources of warmth. Electric blankets and draught excluders are also being recommended as ways to stay warm indoors without running up high energy bills. Loft insulation, meanwhile, is being touted for its potential for long-term energy savings and improved heat retention in homes.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

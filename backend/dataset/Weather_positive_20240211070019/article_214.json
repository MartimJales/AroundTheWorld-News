Clavelli tried his best to get unstuck and avoid being late for work. But he could not do it alone.\nWhile stuck in the snow, cars and trucks passed by. Nobody stopped to help.\nBus driver helps stranded motorist\nAfter about 15 minutes, an MCTS bus operator pulled over near Clavelli&apos;s car. That bus driver, Deneen Tate, ran out of her bus and rushed over to check on Clavelli. Together, Clavelli and Tate rocked the car and got it back onto the road.\nSIGN UP TODAY: Get daily headlines, breaking news emails from FOX6 News\nTate ran back to her bus. Before leaving, she waited to be sure Clavelli could continue driving. Then she yelled out, \"Drive safely!\"\nClavelli made it to work and took the time to share his experience with MCTS.\n\"I couldnâ€™t do it myself. I am very lucky she was there to help me. Truly blessed and thankful; God bless her. Her timing was perfect,\" said Clavelli.",

    "text": "HEADLINES: -Winter Weather Advisory -1\\\" to 3\\\" of snow for many -Snow begins Monday morning. LET IT SNOW!! LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOW Howdy everyone! We have snow moving our Monday into early Tuesday. But it's NOT a typical snow for us. Long read, with hopefully good info: Normally, you’ll hear us discussing a Low-pressure swirl. Maybe a coastal storm, something big coming up from the south-- not this time. This snow is simply occurring from favorable upper level wind, and it’s cold! Instead of precip twirling around a Low, we’ll see random stripes and blobs of snow showing up on the radar. This includes Central Virginia and parts of Southside. No warm air upstairs at 5,000 ft (as there’s no Low to pull it in.) Light to occasional light snow. Light snow begins Monday morning and will occasionally fall much of the day into Monday night and Tuesday morning. Sometimes a little heavier, but nothing resembling a major snowstorm. The mystery: how much sticks? Confidence is high that nearly everyone in the ABC13 area will see snow falling (because no warm air is pulled in overhead), but how much accumulates? We can observe snow sticking at 33 to 35 when it’s falling faster than it can melt. But this is light snow. So are these totals too high? Do we have hours of snow falling, yet nothing sticks? No, I don't know how much snow sticks to roads. Bridges will be more slippery than regular roads. Temperatures will hover between 28 to 34. Less slow sticking east toward Richmond and south toward Danville. LET IT SNOW!! And this one is a bit of mystery how much snow measures up in our yards - George \",\"forecast\":",

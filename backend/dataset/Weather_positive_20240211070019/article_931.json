    "text": "Residents across northern Lincolnshire and even those living across the River Humber were left astounded by a glowing amber and red sky on Friday night. From around 5pm until the early hours of the next morning, a huge flare could be seen coming from a tower at the Prax Lindsey Oil Refinery in [Immingham](https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/immingham), as well as thick plumes of black smoke. Residents in Grimsby and Cleethorpes reported seeing a \"glowing orange\" sky in the distance, which appeared a dark red shade from nearby villages like Killingholme, Stallingborough and Goxhill.

One Hull resident told [Grimsby Live](https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/): \"It really was intense, it looked like the Eye of Sauron.\" One Grimsby resident said: \"I saw it as I was driving past Tesco in Cleethorpes at about 5pm. It just looked like the sky was lit up, I thought it was a fire at first. It looked really bad from where I was, like the sky was on fire. It was like something you see in a film.\" \"I see it every so often lighting up the sky from my back garden, but on Friday it was brighter than I've ever seen it before,\" a Goxhill resident said. Prax Lindsey Oil Refinery issued a community update about the increased flaring, and said it was due to the restarting of production units following power outages in the area that day. The full statement reads: \"Following localised outages earlier today, we are currently undertaking production unit start-ups which may result in some increased flaring and noise levels. Please be assured that every effort will be made to keep this to a minimum, and we would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. \"Should you have any concern on a safety or environmental matter, please contact the refinery on 01469 563 300 to enable us to investigate and respond promptly.\"",

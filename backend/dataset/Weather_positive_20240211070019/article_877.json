    "text": "It’s important to be prepared for extreme cold and understand how dangerous winter conditions can be for our bodies. Skin exposed to some wind chills can develop frostbite within minutes, with hypothermia coming close behind. By paying special attention to wind chill, you can more accurately prepare for shifts in temperature, ice, snow and winds, while preventing cold and wind-chill related health problems during all stages of winter. Bodies lose heat more rapidly in windy conditions. The faster the winds, the more heat is drawn away from exposed skin, causing a drop in internal body temperature. The combination of cold temperature and wind can create such a severe cooling effect that your flesh can actually freeze. Frostbite and hypothermia are both cold-related medical emergencies. Frostbite describes injury caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. Exposure to cold weather conditions — especially when there is a wind chill factor — is the most likely cause. However, frostbite can also result from direct contact with ice, freezing metals and very cold liquids. While exposed skin is more likely to get frostbitten, you can still get frostbite without actual skin exposure. People are also reading… Numbness and tingling in your extremities is usually the first sign of frostbite, although you may not actually feel anything. If treated early enough, frostbite is reversible. Hypothermia is a condition in which your body loses heat faster than it produces it, resulting in dangerously low body temperatures. Normally, our body maintains a temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Hypothermia is typically seen when the body’s temperature is less than 95 degrees. Symptoms include excessive shivering, weakness or exhaustion, fumbling hands, confusion, memory loss and slurred speech. It’s important to remember that each day is what you make it. And your morning routine is a major influence in setting the tone for the rest of your day. Here are key understandings and tips to use as a guide in harnessing the power of morning rituals to kickstart your day. There are several phases of hypothermia, but continuous shivering is usually the first sign you need to increase your protection from the cold and seek shelter. Prolonged hypothermia can be life-threatening. Tips to help prevent frostbite and hypothermia: Limit time outdoors to less than 10 minutes whenever possible. When outside, take shelter from winds, covering all exposed skin. Dress appropriately with layers before going out for even “just a minute.” Keep dry with water-repellant items, and remove wet clothing immediately. Pay special attention to snow or other precipitation getting under your sleeves or into your boots, face, fingers or toes. Avoid drinking alcohol as it can actually lower your body temperature. Consider heated liquids (e.g. soups, tea or milk). Keep backup protective supplies in your home, vehicles and take action to protect pets. This time of year can be very emotional. You can feel nostalgic, bittersweet, hopeful, happy, sad or stressed. In fact, sometimes you can experience seemingly contradictory emotions all at once. Studies underscore that emotional states vary more widely during this time. Get out of the cold immediately if the signs of hypothermia or frostbite appear, and seek medical attention as quickly as possible. There are essentially three main components to an effective, protective layering system, along with accessories: Layer 1: Wear a light, long-sleeved base layer made of nonabsorbent material that fits snuggly against your skin. This layer helps regulate your body temperature and is important for wicking away water and perspiration while keeping your skin dry. Cotton is a poor choice as it absorbs water, keeping it close to your skin. Mid-layer 2: Shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts and trousers help by trapping air and preventing it from circulating and carrying body heat away. Layer 3: Thickness is warmth. For sedentary activities or extremely cold conditions, an outer shell garment with several inches of loft is recommended to protect you from wind, rain or snow. Most allow at least some perspiration to escape, and virtually all are treated with a durable water repellent finish to make water bead up and roll off the fabric. Fit is important, as this layer should be roomy enough to fit easily over other layers and not restrict movement. Accessories: Always protect your head, neck and extremities with similar layers of socks, gloves, hats, hoods, beanies, winter boots, masks and scarves to keep you dry and warm. Winter conditions can amplify your exposure to UV rays, reflected off the surface of the snow. Goggles or sunglasses (and SPF) are important. Avoid overexertion. Your heart works overtime in cold weather, and heart attacks become more of a risk with activities like strenuous snow-clearing as blood pressure and heart rates can spike while cold air constricts blood vessels and decreases the amount of oxygen received by the heart. The American Heart Association recommends: Last week, researchers at Ohio State University released findings of a study of 24,000 people over the age of 30 conducted to better understand Americans’ daily eating habits. The 10-year study findings are setting off alarms, reporting that the average American often packs more calories than a single meal in snacks. Equally concerning, the snacks usually carry little to no nutritional value and account for about one-third of daily added sugar. Taking on half the lifting load each time Taking breaks, often Don’t drink alcohol before or after shoveling snow Know when something is wrong, and stop shoveling. Chest discomfort, shortness of breath or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach could be signs of a heart attack, and you should see a doctor immediately. For the vulnerable, find someone to help shovel your snow. Be vigilant in protecting yourself and taking preventive actions. Know your weather conditions, and always dress appropriately for cold, windy weather.

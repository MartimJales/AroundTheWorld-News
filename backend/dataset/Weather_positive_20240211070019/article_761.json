    "text": "YORK COUNTY, Pa. — Ahead of Tuesday’s expected winter weather, some families took advantage of the extra day off on Monday and decided to hit the slopes in northern York County. Low temperatures equal high levels of excitement for skiers and snowboarders at [Roundtop Mountain Resort ](https://www.skiroundtop.com/)in Warrington Township. The resort is expected to fill ski lifts with families eager to enjoy the winter weather. “Holidays, in general, do turn out to be good for us, people get the days off, they plan their vacations, they come out here, they enjoy the day with us,” said Ted McDowell, the general manager of the resort. Paul Mawhinney, a ski instructor for Roundtop, brought his son for a day of chills and thrills. “A lot of us, with it being a national holiday, we have off work today, so it’s a great day to spend time with the family because it’s right in the middle of the season where you have some of the coldest temperatures and some of the best snow,” Mawhinney said. McDowell says this week’s weather conditions are perfect for laying down snow. “It’s a low humidity day, it’s a cold day, it’s not a very windy day, those are perfect snow-making conditions for us.” Snow machines are expected to run at full blast over the next several days, despite the snow expected into Tuesday. “We have cold, dry temperatures, low temperatures at night, not going above freezing during the day, and that makes perfect snow-making conditions where they can make a lot of great now for us,” Mawhinney said. Snowtubing is expected to open at the resort later in the week. People are encouraged to purchase passes ahead of their arrival due to the expected increased volume of customers. The resort is open Monday through Saturday with varying [ hours of operation.](https://www.skiroundtop.com/explore-the-resort/about-the-resort/hours-of-operation.aspx)",

The smaller the difference between the inside and outside temperatures, the lower your energy usage and bills. One of the easiest things customers can do for heating efficiency is to change air filters regularly. A dirty air filter makes a heating system work harder, which uses more energy and can increase costs. Also, have heating systems checked regularly by a qualified heating and air conditioning contractor to maintain efficiency and peak performance. Leave drapes or blinds open during sunny winter days to allow the sun's rays to warm the house, but close them at night to help insulate your home. One of best energy-saving habits you can do each year is to check windows, doors and vents for air leaks. Caulking, sealing and weatherstripping leaks can save 10% to 20% in heating costs. Replace standard bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LED).Â LEDs are more efficient than regular bulbs, while giving off the same amount of light. Replacing just six of your most frequently used bulbs with LEDs can save up to $480 over the lifetime of the bulbs. Operate ceiling fans in a clockwise direction in the winter, which pushes warm air back down into the room. (Most fans have a switch that allows you to reverse the motor.) While fans move air and make people more comfortable, they do not provide heat, so remember to turn the fan off when you leave the room. Manage water heating. Set your water heater to 120 degrees or less. Water heating is typically the second biggest user of energy in your home. Ways to manage winter heating bills\nDuke Energy offers free programs and tools to help customers better manage and understand their monthly energy expenses:\nBudget Billing Â gives customers better control over their energy spending by establishing predictable monthly payments.

Weatherization Program: Â Available in some Duke Energy service territories to help income-qualified customers save energy and reduce expenses through energy conservation measures like weatherstripping and HVAC repairs or replacements.

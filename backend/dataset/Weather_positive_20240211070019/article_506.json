Pricing and availability are subject to change. Yahoo Canada Style 15 best snow blowers & snow throwers for winter 2024, according to reviewers Should you buy a snow blower or a snow thrower? Here's what to know. Read full article Kayla Kuefler Â· Shopping & Lifestyle Editor January 12, 2024 at 7:02 p.m. Best snow blowers and throwers of 2024, according to reviewers (Photo via Getty)\nIf this winter has felt warmer than usual, you have El NiÃ±o to thank. El NiÃ±o, a climate pattern marked by above-average sea surface temperatures, has delayed consistent cold conditions for many Canadians, postponing the season's snow, ice and frost. However, some climate scientists forewarn a \"dramatic pattern change\" in January and February, bringing blizzard-like conditions back to several provinces. Environment Canada has issued an extreme cold warning for all of Alberta, and in eastern Canada, one weather system is expected to bring 20 to 40 centimetres of snow. Though the season's snowfall can be challenging to predict, the white stuff will eventually find its way, prompting the need for a new snow blower or thrower.\nSnow blower vs. snow thrower: What's the difference? While they essentially perform the same task, snow blowers and snow throwers are, in fact, two different things.\nA snow thrower is a single-stage machine, meaning it uses a rotating auger to pick up snow and cast it out of the shoot in one continuous motion.\nA snow blower, on the other hand, works in two stages. Similar to a snow thrower, it uses a rotating auger to scoop up snow, but rather than immediately shooting it out, it feeds the snow into an impeller (a powerful fan) which blows it out of the chute.\nSnow blowers versus snow throwers: What's the difference? (Photo via Getty) Do I need a snow blower or a snow thrower? There are a few factors to consider to determine whether you need a snow blower or a snow thrower.\nSnow conditions : If you don't typically get a lot of snow, a snow thrower may be a better option as they're smaller and less powerful than a snow blower, which means they tend to be less expensive. If you're used to seeing heavy snow conditions, you'll be better off with a snow blower as they're larger, more powerful and equipped to handle heavy snowfall.\nGas-powered vs. electric: Many snow throwers are corded, meaning you can rely on your home's electricity for power. However, that also means you have limitations on how long the cord is and where you can take your machine. On the other hand, snow blowers tend to be fuel-powered, so you have flexibility on where you can take them, but in turn, they require gasoline and more maintenance than their electrical counterparts.\nWhere to buy a snow blower/thrower in Canada Amazon Canada\nCanadian Tire\nHome Hardware\nRona\nTroy Bilt\nWalmart\nIf you're interested in investing in a snow blower or snow thrower this winter season, scroll down to shop 15 reviewer-loved-and-tested snow blowers and throwers under $500, $1,000 and $2,000.\nðŸ’° Best budget snow blower: Certified 13.5-Amp Electric Corded Snowblower This small but mighty electric snowblower has earned hundreds of five-star reviews from Canadian Tire shoppers who praise its \"stunning performance\" and \"easy to use\" design.\nCertified 13.5-Amp Electric Corded Snowblower $200 See at Canadian Tire ðŸ’°ðŸ’° Best middle-of-the-road snow blower: Briggs & Stratton 1022ER 208cc Single Stage Gas Snowblower This mid-range unit has earned near-perfect reviews from Canadian Tire shoppers who call the unit a \"beast\" and say it \"gets right down to the pavement.\"\nBriggs & Stratton 1022ER 208cc Single Stage Gas Snowblower $800 $900 Save $100 See at Canadian Tire ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° Best high-end snow blower: Briggs & Stratton 1696807 208cc 2-Stage Gas Snowblower If you're looking for bells and whistles, we suggest checking out Briggs & Stratton's 208cc two-stage gas snowblower.

    "text": "Three provinces are coming together to fight the battle against mental illness and addictions.\nThe main goal of the partnership of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Ontario is to create recovery care plans. It will be an information-sharing partnership as they move to a recovery-oriented system of care.\n“Saskatchewan is focused on helping people overcome addictions and live healthy, safe lives,” Tim McLeod, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Seniors and Rural and Remote Health, Saskatchewan said.\n“By helping people overcome addictions, we can save lives, heal families and strengthen our communities.”\nOver the last two days, ministers from Alberta, Sask., and Ontario met in Calgary for the eighth annual Recovery Capital Conference of Canada.\nAlberta’s recovery model will act as the base for the new partnership, meant to break down barriers and increase access to recovery services.\nStory continues below advertisement “We are eager to share the Alberta Recovery Model because we believe it is the most dignified, comprehensive and compassionate approach in any jurisdiction across Canada to help people overcome their mental health challenges and recover from the deadly disease of addiction,” Alberta Minister of Mental Health and Addiction, Dan Williams, said.\n1:50 Addiction conference debates recovery focused care in Calgary Earlier this week, Alberta unveiled two new agencies to deliver mental health and addiction services.\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday. Recovery Alberta will be tasked with delivering mental health and addiction services currently covered by Alberta Health Services. The province is also establishing a new Crown corporation called the Canadian Centre of Recovery Excellence.\nSaskatchewan has not made the same announcement but will be working with Alberta and Ontario to develop new plans to treat mental health and addiction.\nTrending Now O.J.

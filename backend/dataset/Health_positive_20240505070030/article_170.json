But, I'll do it all over again. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Getting through a session is always hard but the aftermath of it is something that I absolutely love. I am irregular at times. But, both my body and my coach don't ever give up on me. Thanks to both of them. My coach and I have completely changed my routine now and I'm loving what I see. The only thing that sticks with me after a workout is my coach @prashanth3488 sir always asking me to breathe. Just like in life, BREATHE.\"\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Sapthami Gowda ðŸ§¿ (@sapthami_gowda)\n\\n Sapthami's workout video has sparked curiosity among the netizens.

    "text": "New Delhi: Brain is among the most essential organ of the body. Research has shown that improved brain health is linked with better physical, mental and emotional well-being. However, in the present era, various lifestyle habits are affecting the organ. These habits include, smoking, binge drinking, unhealthy eating, lack of physical activity are damaging the brain.\nMoreover, the environmental conditions are not helping at all. Air pollution, climate change, heatwave, cold wave, and several other are also impacting the brain health. But the good news is that brain health can be improved with good food.\n4 foods to eat for brain health\nLeafy greens: Foods like kale, spinach, collards, and broccoli are rich in brain-healthy nutrients. Research found that these foods can help slow cognitive decline.\nFatty fish: Filled with omega-3 fatty acid, fatty fish are brain boosting foods. These are abundant sources of healthy unsaturated fats that have been linked to lower blood levels of beta-amyloid-the protein that forms damaging clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.\nIt has been advised to eat fish at least twice a week, but before starting this diet you must consult your physician. If you’re not a fan of fish, ask your doctor about taking an omega-3 supplement, or choose terrestrial omega-3 sources such as flaxseeds, avocados, and walnuts.\nBerries: Research shows flavonoids, the natural plant pigments that give berries their brilliant hues, also help improve memory. Aa per a study, conducted by Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital researchers, found that women who consumed two or more servings of strawberries and blueberries each week delayed memory decline by up to two-and-a-half years.\nWalnuts: Nuts are excellent sources of protein and healthy fats, and one type of nut in particular might also improve memory. Especially walnuts, they do not just look like human brain but act as brain booster as well. Moreover, the nutrients in this nut have been linked to lower blood pressure and cleaner arteries. That’s good for both the heart and brain.",

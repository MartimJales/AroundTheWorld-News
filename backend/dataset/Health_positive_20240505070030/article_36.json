    "text": "Regenative Labs' Latest Published Study Demonstrates the Safety and Efficacy of Wharton's Jelly Connective Tissue Allograft for Rotator Cuff Tears\nPENSACOLA, Fla., April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Regenative Labs (Regenative), a leading HCT/P manufacturer, announces the publication of a study exhibiting the safety and efficacy of Wharton's Jelly connective tissue allograft for rotator cuff tears. The need for further research in supplementing connective tissue defects was evident given that there are approximately 4.5 million shoulder pain patient visits and 250,000 rotator cuff repairs annually in the United States. Patients in need of rotator cuff repairs often seek minimally invasive options, making Wharton's Jelly a promising alternative for musculoskeletal defects.\nDr. Albert Lai of Desert Pain Specialists and Centers of Rehabilitation and Pain Medicine in California and Dr. Conrad Tamea of Orthopedic Associates of Tampa Bay participated in the study. As a Double Board-Certified Physician with specialties in Physical Medicine Rehabilitation and Pain Medicine, Dr. Lai had this to say about the approach, \"Incorporating Wharton's jelly into our practice has provided an effective conservative option for patients with rotator cuff defects that outperforms conventional therapies. Utilizing the structural connective tissue allografts has allowed many patients to avoid surgery altogether and significantly improve their quality of life.\"\nThe study titled\n\"Safety and Efficacy of Wharton's Jelly Connective Tissue Allograft for Rotator Cuff Tears,\" was published by MDPI and can be accessed in its entirety here.\nThe study follows 87 patients with rotator cuff defects from 20 private practices who received an application of a Wharton's jelly allograft from Regenative Labs after having failed at least 8 weeks of conservative treatment. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the improvement of patient-reported pain, quality of life, and functionality scales after applying Wharton's jelly (WJ) in rotator cuff defects.\nPatient outcomes were tracked on a 90-day calendar utilizing three scales including the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Quality of Life Scales (QOLS), and Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index (WOMAC) covering pain, stiffness, and functionality. There were statistically significant differences between the initial application and Day 90 for all three scales.\nThe application of Wharton's jelly allografts in this retrospective cohort was observed to promote decreases in patient reported NPRS scores, pain, and stiffness in the shoulder and improve function. These improvements were consistent across age groups but were most notable for the elderly population, who generally have a slower and less effective recovery rate after conservative treatment and surgical procedures. Given the success shown by NPRS and WOMAC in decreasing pain in the elderly population, more studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Wharton's Jelly, specifically in patients older than 65.\n\"Rotator cuff repairs are estimated to make up somewhere between $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion of annual healthcare expenditures in the US. It's clear that the need for this type of research is necessary and quite frankly, overdue,\" said Tyler Barrett, CEO of Regenative Labs.\nThe positive results from this study and the current literature provide a foundation to study applications of Wharton's jelly in other musculoskeletal injuries to ultimately improve the quality of life and reduce the economic healthcare burden of multiple conservative treatments or expensive surgical procedures.\n\"As a board-certified Orthopedic Surgeon with over 25 years of operative experience, I can say after using Wharton's jelly allografts in more than 200 cases, I have found them to be extremely beneficial to my patients. Orthopedic applications using Wharton's jelly, including in the knee, shoulder, hip, and spine, are more often than not preventing the need for surgery that results in a prolonged recovery time, lost wages, and great financial cost,\" said Dr. Tamea.\nBarrett and his team hope to enlist physicians in Regenative Labs' retrospective repository to take part in studies regarding uncovered uses. Physicians will have their outcomes highlighted, furthering the understanding of regenerative medicine and uncovering new applications for this groundbreaking field of medicine.\nContact Regenative to get your practice involved today.

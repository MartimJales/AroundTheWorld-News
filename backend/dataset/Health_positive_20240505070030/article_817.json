    "text": "Free Mental Health First Aid Training Offered at Shoreline Community College!\nShoreline Community College Counseling Center is offering free Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training for our campus community. MHFA is a research-supported international education program developed to teach adults how to recognize and respond to signs and symptoms of mental health and substance use challenges. MHFA is a skills-based course that gives people the tools to assist someone who might be struggling with mental health or substance use challenges and connect them with appropriate support and resources. To date, 2.5 million people across the United States have been trained in MHFA.\nJust as CPR helps those without clinical training assist an individual having a heart attack, MHFA prepares participants to interact with a person experiencing a mental health crisis. Mental Health First Aiders learn a 5-step Action Plan that guides them through reaching out and offering appropriate support.\nWith support from the Counseling Center, this training (valued at $170.00/participant) is FREE to Shoreline Community College employees and students.\nTraining Details:\nWe are currently offering a blended training which includes:\n- 2-hour, self-paced online training prior to the in-person training and\n- 6.5 hour in-person training\nThis quarter’s in-person training is scheduled for:\nFriday, April 12th, 9:00am-3:30pm\nThe self-paced online training must be completed prior to attending the in-person training. You must complete the online and in-person training to become a certified Mental Health First Aider. MHFA certification lasts for 3 years.\nIf you cannot make this date – we will be offering another training later in the quarter.\nPlease email Gwyn Hoffman-Robinson at gehoffman@shoreline.edu to register and/or find out more information. Please note registration is limited and a waiting list will be started when capacity is reached. Once registered, details as far as room location, etc. will be shared.\nLocation: TBD",

    "text": "How to watch LSU gymnastics open NCAA regional in Fayetteville on Thursday night The LSU gymnastics team has clinched a postseason berth for the 39th consecutive season, and it's heading to Arkansas as the No. 2 national seed and the top seed in the Fayetteville Region. LSU (19-3, 5-2 SEC) has a National Qualifying Score of 198.215, the highest in program history, as it seeks to punch its ticket to the NCAA championships in Fort Worth. The Tigers begin their postseason run in the Thursday evening session, where they're joined by No. 15 Minnesota, No. 18 Oregon State and BYU. “There’s no such thing as an easy regional. We’ll see some familiar SEC faces and we know that it’ll be a great environment, but regardless of where we go, we have a job to do” coach Jay Clark said in a release. “It’s just about us staying on our same message, and that’s focusing on the five minutes in front of our face and not getting too ahead of ourselves. We just have to go out there and be normal. If we can do that, then we’re pretty confident in the results.” The regional round runs through Saturday and the NCAA championships will be from April 18-20. Here's what you need to know to watch LSU's opening session at the Fayetteville Regional on Thursday night.

He is recovering well and will continue to recuperate at home with his family.\n[pic.twitter.com/26a9f9T85N]\n— MassGeneral News (@MassGeneralNews)\n[April 3, 2024]\n“This moment – leaving the hospital today with one of the cleanest bills of health I’ve had in a long time – is one I wished would come for many years,” Slayman said in a statement issued by the hospital, according to CNN. “Now, it’s a reality and one of the happiest moments of my life.”\nThe 62-year-old is a manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. He previously said a doctor recommended he try the pig kidney when he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease.\nLast month, Slayman’s doctors said a new kidney could last years, but there are also many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. The hospital said the surgery, which occurred on March 16, happened after years of research and pre-clinical studies.",

In a statement, Rick Slayman joyfully announced, \"This moment - leaving the hospital today with one of the cleanest bills of health I've had in a long time - is one I wished would come for many years,\" . In late March, Slayman, 62, following an [end](https://www.hngn.com/articles/253503/20231031/second-ever-recipient-of-pig-heart-transplant-dies-six-weeks-after-experimental-procedure.htm)-stage kidney disease diagnosis, had the problem organ replaced by none other than a genetically-modified pig's kidney. Massachusetts General Hospital, where the surgery took place, announced that Slayman is \"recovering well and will continue to recuperate at home with his family.\" Slayman further [proclaimed](https://www.massgeneral.org/news/rick-slayman-discharge-statement), \"I'm excited to resume spending time with my family, friends, and loved ones free from the burden of dialysis that has affected my quality of life for many years,\" he continued, thanking his team of surgeons for the care he received. \"Lastly, I want to thank anyone who has seen my story and sent well-wishes, especially patients waiting for a kidney transplant. Today marks a new beginning not just for me, but for them, as well. My recovery is progressing smoothly and I ask for privacy at this time.\" Slayman's four-hour pig kidney transplant was conducted on March 21. The surgery at the Mass General Hospital Transplant Center included a \"genetically-edited pig kidney with 69 genomic edits,\", according to [People.](https://people.com/first-living-pig-kidney-transplant-patient-goes-home-8624795https://)",

    "text": "KINGSTON, R.I. — April 4, 2024 – University of Rhode Island student volunteers danced the day away on a recent Sunday to benefit children with life-threatening and chronic illnesses. The volunteers and participants of RhodyTHON 2024 had much to celebrate at the conclusion of the dance marathon by raising more than $52,000 for Hasbro Children’s Hospital, a Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. RhodyTHON began at 10 a.m. and ended at 8 p.m. in Mackal Field House, during which participants enjoyed a variety of activities, games and performances from student organizations. Run by student volunteers, the event attracted more than 600 people, including 100 who registered that day. A moving and energetic day, the big reveal came at the end, when student organizers Grace Heppes and Gabrielle Pino, both URI seniors, unveiled the amount raised this year. “There’s a feeling you get the day of the event that we talk about, us on the executive board and really anyone else who comes, and if you haven’t been there you won’t know what it’s like until you have,” says Heppes, of Otisville, New York, a clinical neuroscience major with minors in leadership studies and special populations. “It is such a special and indescribable feeling. It is so rewarding to know how much of an impact we have made. It is a rare opportunity to make such a difference while having the time of your life.” Heppes and Pino, of Ewa Beach, Hawai’i, a double major in film media and communications, with a minor in general business, had been preparing for RhodyTHON since last years’ event. As executive director and communications director, respectively, they are members of an executive board with 25 members. “Throughout the year, the RhodyTHON communications team worked toward creating infographics and videos to encourage members of the URI Community to register for Donor Drive until the main event,” Pino said. “Knowing the impact social media has on various communities, we were able to dedicate hourly posts for each Miracle Child to fundraise a certain amount based on their stories. During the main event, it was heartwarming to see everyone posting on their social media accounts to spread the love and joy RhodyTHON brings to the URI community.” Members of the organization undertook individual challenges during the year to raise money for the program. They also participated in group fundraising. Heppes did a push up for each dollar donation she received, while Pino accepted donations of $5 every time someone cracked an egg over her head. Heppes was inspired to get involved with Rhodython by her older sister, who founded another Miracle Network Dance Marathon fundraiser, “BomberTHON,” while attending Ithaca College in New York. When Heppes contacted the URI organization in October as a first-year student in 2020, there was just one position open on the RhodyTHON executive board. She describes the uncertain return of RhodyTHON after the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of time that influenced her entire URI experience, including her efforts to spread awareness and encourage the URI community and beyond to register for this event. Each of the 10 hours that made up RhodyTHON were devoted to an individual Miracle Child. At the top of each hour, choreographed “morale” dance performances kicked off the incoming series of dedicated activities. Dancers and children and their families enjoyed various crafts and snacks, all tailored to the interests of each Miracle Child during their hour. The Miracle Children and their families walked down a red carpet to begin their honorary time period. Mailboxes located near seats for the Miracle Children and their families allowed attendees to drop off letters of encouragement, praise and comfort. Apparatus from URI Emergency Medical Services and the Kingston Fire Department were available for children to explore outside the Mackal Field House. URI students recognized the familiar sight of URI Police Cpl. Paul Hanrahan serving up good, old-fashioned, hot dogs. One of the Miracle Kids set up a lemonade stand he built last summer to assist the fundraising effort. Those interested may still make a donation online .

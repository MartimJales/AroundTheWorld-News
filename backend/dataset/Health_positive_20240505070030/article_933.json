    "text": "A pioneer in healthy, natural and delicious food and drink, Rude Health, has confirmed the addition of a brand new Granola – Maple & Pecan. The new flavour will be rolling out nationwide with Waitrose across 259 stores from 29th March (RRP: £4 / 400g). The latest launch is also available on Ocado and to the Independents via wholesalers including Infinity and Auguste Noel from next month.\nBuilding on the successes of the rest of the Rude Health cereals range, the Granolas offer a unique and indulgent proposition thanks to the combination of delicious taste, real ingredients and balanced nutrition. Packed with pecans, wholegrains and sunflower seeds and an added drizzle of maple syrup, the new flavour is high in fibre and pairs perfectly with the Rude Health Organic Almond Drink.\nIn addition to the NPD, the full cereal portfolio also boasts a fresh new look, hitting the shelves from March. In a bid to further drive desirability, the new design uses strong visuals and brighter, bolder graphics, which will create greater stand out on shelf, bringing the Rude Health brand to the front and centre. The iconic ‘lips’ have been made more prominent on pack, to represent both the delicious taste, as well as the Rude Health ‘attitude’. Rolled out at the end of last year with the dairy-free drinks range, the design re-fresh also aims to provide clearer visibility of the nutritional benefits and health claims, making the fixture easier to navigate for consumers.\nThe Organic Wild Berry Granola recipe has been re-developed to improve clusters, texture and appearance. Now with raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries, the pack itself has also been updated in colour and copy to drive the deliciousness. As the only organic berry SKU, it has now been voted #1 for overall enjoyment vs the competition.\nFounder Camilla Barnard says: “People have loved our granolas ever since we launched The Ultimate Granola – they balance kitchen cupboard ingredients with health and indulgence. So we felt that Maple & Pecan was a no brainer addition to the line up. It’s a flavour people love – in fact it’s the second fastest growing flavour in the wider cereals category! It’s no surprise, given shoppers are looking for more indulgent flavours to enjoy beyond their usual weekday breakfasts. We know they will love this crunchy, nutty granola.\nThe launch was also the perfect opportunity to refresh our packs. Rude Health is all about deliciousness and we wanted to make this even clearer on our cereals range. The new designs are more consistent with our drinks range and hero the benefits more clearly – they really pop on shelf!”\nThe full Rude Health range is made using quality ingredients and nothing artificial. All products are non UPF – organic, dairy-free, non GMO, containing no gums and no gunk!",

    "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — The City of Columbia kicked off its first Black Maternal Health Week, an idea that was kickstarted by a University of South Carolina student.\nThe goal is to raise awareness about black maternal health in our state while educating women and mothers on the available resources to help advocate and educate themselves during childbirth.\nEbony Christie came up with the idea for the health week. \"I really wanted to shine a light on the issues that are not always talked about,\" she said.\nChristie is a junior public health major currently attending USC. \"One of the biggest things was the black maternal mortality rate across South Carolina,\" she said.\n To get the project rolling, she reached out to Columbia City Councilwoman Aditi Bussells.\n\"Black women are three or four times more likely to die from pregnancy related complications compared to white women,\" Bussells explained.\nDr. Kiri-Claudia Allen Harrington echoed these disparities, which she said happen due to multiple factors including healthcare, underlying chronic conditions, structural racism, and implicit bias.\n\"If we do the advocacy work, and come together and really focus on closing disparities in health care in community resources we won't be having this conversation,\" Harrington said. \"To be honest with you, if we make birthing safer for Black mothers and indigenous mothers and Latino mothers, it will become safer for everyone.\n In order to make birthing safer within the state Dr. Harrington said it will take more than one contributing factor….\n\"Wat are the resources where people are getting education, access to the doctor, fresh foods. and housing security and transportation security, so it's just not one factor.\"\n\"I want young people like myself to know to always be aware, do your research and find something you're passionate about. work hard at it and with that you will be able to make it a bigger issue and bring more awareness and change to that,\" said Christie.\n The events held during Black Maternal Health Week are the following:\nSaturday, April 6 from 11am-3pm - “Mom’s Market”: Health Fair for Moms, Families, and Babies\nLocation: Drew R.

    "text": "BELLEVUE, WAS / ACCESSWIRE / April 4, 2024 / Overlake Medical Center & Clinics has begun using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to take notes and summarize patient visits, allowing providers to spend less time on paperwork and more time providing care.\nOverlake Implements AI Tool to Enhance Patient-Provider Interaction, Improve Productivity\nChristy Chan, MD, Overlake Clinics primary care provider, uses AI technology to take clinical notes. Overlake has deployed Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX™) Copilot, a Microsoft product that combines conversational, ambient, and generative AI to automatically and securely draft clinical notes for immediate review and completion after each patient visit.\nDAX™ Copilot goes to work during patient-provider verbal interactions. The software drafts notes in real time that immediately translate into Epic, Overlake's electronic health record system. This process alleviates countless after-clinic hours of administrative burden-commonly referred to as \"pajama time\"-and allows providers to focus on the needs of their patients face to face.\nBeyond increasing operational efficiency, the technology improves the patient experience, as well as increases provider satisfaction and retention by reducing burnout.\n\"The psychological benefits have been the best part of this application,\" says Christy Chan, MD, Overlake Clinics family medicine physician. \"The burden of having to remember all the details and urgency of closing notes is significantly removed.\"\nAccording to a nationwide survey conducted among 1,000 clinicians who utilized DAX technology, respondents reported saving 7 minutes in notetaking per patient encounter, 79% reported experiencing a better work-life balance , and 70% said this software helped alleviate feelings of burnout and fatigue .\nDAX Copilot utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model and is amplified by the capabilities of the Microsoft Azure cloud, which is certified by the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®) and supports federal law restricting the release of medical information. This advanced software also increases accuracy by lowering the potential for human error in the charting process.\n\"Our patients' safety and privacy are our highest priorities and are factors in every decision we make about technological advancements,\" says Scott Waters, Overlake's chief information and technology officer. \"It is a sacred honor to be trusted with our patients' care, and we are pleased to offer this exciting, new tool that will elevate their experience.\"\nOverlake plans to have DAX Copilot technology implemented in at least five clinics across the organization by mid-May.\nAbout Overlake Medical Center & Clinics\nOverlake Medical Center & Clinics is a nonprofit regional healthcare system based in Bellevue, Wash., serving the Eastside community since 1960. The health system includes a 349-bed hospital and a growing network of primary, urgent and specialty care clinics located throughout the region.

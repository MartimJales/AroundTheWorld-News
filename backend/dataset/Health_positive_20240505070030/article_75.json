    "text": "(HealthDay News) — For patients with Parkinson’s disease, lixisenatide yields less progression of motor disability than placebo, according to a study published in the April 4 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine .\nWassilios G. Meissner, MD, PhD, from the French Clinical Research Network for Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorder in Toulouse, and colleagues conducted a phase 2 randomized trial involving patients with Parkinson’s disease. Participants who received diagnoses less than three years earlier, receiving a stable dose of medications to treat symptoms, and did not have motor complications were randomly assigned to daily subcutaneous lixisenatide or placebo for 12 months in a 1:1 ratio (78 participants in each group) followed by a two-month washout period.\nThe researchers found that scores on the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III had changed by −0.04 points and 3.04 points in the lixisenatide and placebo groups, indicating improvement and worsening disability, respectively. After a two-month washout period, at 14 months, the mean MDS-UPDRS motor scores were 17.7 and 20.6 with lixisenatide and placebo, respectively, in the off-medication state. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 46 and 13 percent, respectively, of participants receiving lixisenatide.\n“The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide had a three-point beneficial effect, as compared with placebo, in the change over a 12-month period from a baseline value of approximately 15 points on a 132-point scale measuring motor disability,” the authors write.\nSanofi provided the medication and placebo for the study.\nAbstract/Full Text (subscription or payment may be required)\nEditorial (subscription or payment may be required)\nMore from McKnight's Senior Living",

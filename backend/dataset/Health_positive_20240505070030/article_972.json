    "text": "WAUSAU, Wis.(WAOW)-- Since 2012, ['Executive Cleaning LLC'](https://www.execcleaning.com/about) in Marathon County has been offering cleaning services to customers, but now the company has expanded to help those in need. Two years ago, the company decided to partner with a nationwide organization, ['Cleaning For A Reason'](https://cleaningforareason.org/), to offer a helping hand to people who are battling cancer. Executive Cleaning is owned by Bob Schneider, but since the company has added the Cleaning For A Reason to its services long time family friend Beth Anderson has become the manager of the program. \"I was really excited to meet these people, and what a blessing to come around people when they are just so fatigued and so tired and really it is just a simple thing you can do, many of them can not vacuum their home. Many of them can't clean. It's really wonderful to be a friend to them,\" said Anderson. Since offering the service the company has been able to help nine families. Anyone interested must visit [Cleaning For A Reason.](https://cleaningforareason.org/patients/) Once signed up Executive Cleaning offers up to four free cleaning services.",

    "text": "In this day and age,\nbody-contouring procedures are some of the most sought-after noninvasive treatments for sculpting, toning and firming some of the most stubborn areas of the body. While noninvasive procedures offer incredible results with little to no downtime, cost is still a big hurdle for many individuals interested in the body-contouring procedures.\nIf you’ve ever looked into body-contouring treatments, you’ve definitely heard of CoolSculpting. If you’ve been thinking about giving the viral,\nfat-reducing treatment a go but have been waiting for the right time, here’s your opportunity, as CoolSculpting is offering major savings on their hero treatment all month long.\nHow to Save on Your First CoolSculpting Elite Treatment\nAs\nsummer is approaching, many people are thinking about body contouring more than usual, which prompted Allergan’s launch of their savings initiative, CoolMonth last year. “According to a survey we conducted last year, 50 percent of people would look into body contouring treatments in preparation for summer,” said Jasson Gilmore, senior vice president of U.S. Aesthetics at Allergan. “Also, our patient satisfaction research shows that 89 percent of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with CoolSculpting after two visits. We want to support individuals seeking treatment by offering promotions throughout CoolMonth that focus on encouraging patients to reach out to trained providers for more information on CoolSculpting Elite and a full treatment plan.”\nJust this week, Allergan Aesthetics, the masterminds behind the CoolSculpting empire, announced the return of CoolMonth—the month-long celebration of all things CoolSculpting that includes major savings on their most popular treatments. From April 1 to April 30, you can save $200 on your first CoolSculpting Elite treatment amongst other unique CoolSavings opportunities.\nLike CoolSculpting, CoolSculpting Elite is “FDA-cleared for the treatment of visible fat bulges in the thigh, abdomen, and flank, along with bra fat, back fat, underneath the buttocks, and upper arm in patients with a Body Mass Index of 30 or less and in submental and submandibular areas in patients with a BMI of 46.2 or less. It is also FDA-cleared to affect the appearance of lax tissue with submental area treatments.”\nIf you want to get in on all things CoolSavings, we’ve got you covered. All you have to do is visit\nCoolSculpting’s website to locate a provider near you, and search for one that features the CoolMonth of Savings logo. After that, simply get in touch with your provider to score your deal, and for even more savings, join Allergan’s membership program, Allē for $200 off your first treatment right away.",

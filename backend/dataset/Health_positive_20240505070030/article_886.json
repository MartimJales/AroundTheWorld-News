    "text": "Mother of donor and recipients share stories and highlight importance of organ donation at Methodist University MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Locals gathered at Methodist University Hospital on Thursday for its annual flag-raising ceremony in honor of Donate Life Month. Three speakers shared their stories about organ donation, including Anna Lopez, who made the decision to donate her teen son’s organs after he tragically died in a car accident. Lopez is currently the chief operating officer at Methodist Germantown Hospital. The other two speakers at Thursday’s event received transplants themselves. The goal of the annual event is to raise awareness about organ donation and encourage people to consider being a donor. According to Methodist University, the importance of organ donation impacts a large portion of the Mid-South since our community has a higher prevalence of diabetes and renal failure, directly impacting the need for liver and kidney transplants.

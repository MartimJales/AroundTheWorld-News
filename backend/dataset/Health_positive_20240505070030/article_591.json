    "text": "According to a release, Longleaf Recovery & Wellness, a primary mental health outpatient facility in Hoover, officially opened on Tuesday, April 2, with a ribbon-cutting and open house. The event featured Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kim Boswell and Hoover Mayor Frank Brocato. “It is such a privilege to partner with this group to expand and increase access to care in Alabama,” said Commissioner Boswell. “It is so important for programs like (this) to expand and provide the missing gaps in the continuum of care. This program will be instrumental in serving a need…that is not really currently available in our state.” “[People] need facilities like this where they can come in, have an opportunity to recover and to enjoy the quality of life that God intended for them to have,” Mayor Brocato said. Chief Executive Officer Colin Harris said it is “abundantly clear there is a tremendous need for more accessible, high-quality options for both substance use treatment and comprehensive mental health treatment in Alabama.” The mission of Longleaf, a partnership between Birmingham Recovery Center, LIV Development and EBSCO Industries, is to bring more treatment options to Alabamians through strategic expansion. The company’s Huntsville-area location will open in late April, with plans for a Baldwin County facility to open mid-summer.

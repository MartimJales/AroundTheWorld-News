Now, more than ever, with Kate&apos;s cancer diagnosis too, Harry wants them to know he is there for them.&quot; Prince Harry talks seeing King Charles amid cancer battle Additionally, it was mentioned that Harry will be juggling his schedule around his charity work for the Invictus Games to ensure he can spend as much time as possible with his father.

He is coming over for his charity work, which is so important to him so he will juggle his schedule accordingly, but seeing his dad will come first.&quot; During his previous visit, Harry was granted a brief 30-minute audience with his father just before King Charles commenced his cancer treatment. Despite the limited time, Harry was said to be appreciative of the opportunity to see him.

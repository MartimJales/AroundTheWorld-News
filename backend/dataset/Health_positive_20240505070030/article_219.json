    "text": "Pope Memorial gets donation match to help animal’s medical needs THOMASTON, Maine (WABI) - Pope Memorial Humane Society in Thomaston is getting a big financial boost! A $75,000 matching gift is being donated to Pope’s Sherman Medical Fund. The fund was created in 2020 to honor a kitten named Sherman and his siblings. At just four weeks old, the kittens were rescued from a fire and needed immediate care for burns, smoke inhalation, and singed fur. This gift matches every dollar donated up to $75,000 which could mean a $150,00 donation in total. These funds would ensure lifesaving treatment is available to all homeless pets facing medical challenges. “Just the fact that our donors are so committed to helping us take care of these animals, it means the world to us. We take in, oh goodness, about 1,400 animals each year. And, you know, pretty much every single one needs medical in some form, whether it’s a vaccine or spaying and neutering. You never know if there’s gonna be an amputation or what other medical needs, but there’s a lot and this the Sherman Medical Fund is what that’s here for everyone,” said Kasey Bielecki, Pope Memorial’s Marketing and Public Relations.

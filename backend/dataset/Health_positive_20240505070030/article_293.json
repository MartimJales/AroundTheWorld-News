    "text": "TROY, N.Y. — Vanderheyden, the Troy-based non-profit assisting youth and families in crisis, celebrated 190 years this week at The Bessy Group Home, one of their original and still active buildings on Spring Avenue.\nJoined by staff, board members, and local and state representatives, the speakers recounted and honored the continuing legacy of the institution.\n“Heal, growth, and hope; those are kind of our keys,” President and CEO Karen Carpenter said. “Our job is to be the best place to go to school for those that need to go to school here, the best place to live for those that need to live with us, and the best place to work.”\nEstablished in 1933 as the Troy Orphan Asylum by the Troy Women’s Benevolence Society, it originally provided the basics to children who didn’t have them: food, clothes, shelter, etc. But now, Carpenter said, it’s about providing those foundations while setting them up for success throughout their lifetimes.\nThe organization serves 700 people in need from 30 counties in New York State. One of the oldest in the nation, it focuses on child welfare for those with emotional, behavioral, or developmental needs and tackles them from multiple angles to best suit the person and situation.\nOnsite, Vanderheyden has everything from their 7-12 grade school, residential programs for people up to age 21, and diagnostic services. Additionally, they have community programs like in-house assessments, job services, and their thrift store, the Vandy in downtown Albany, which provides both a starting job for residents and a revenue stream for the non-profit.\nMark Eagan, the president and CEO of the Capital Region Chamber, said non-profits often go overlooked for the revenue they bring into the area. Tax-exempt organizations bring in $28 billion to the Capital Region, he said.\n“The majority of that goes to direct service, to the employees, the folks that live in our neighborhoods so we need to pay attention to that,” Eagan said during the recognition Wednesday. “If you really want to know really the soul of a community, it’s how do they take care of the most vulnerable and that’s really what Vanderheyden has done and done so amazingly well.”\nCarpenter said they have to have these celebrations and these moments to remind the community that they exist and are putting in this work — though it may often go unseen. These are people’s lives; they don’t want to advertise them.\nBut they need resources as a non-profit organization, she said. The organization used the event this week to announce their $1.9 million capital campaign that they can use to upgrade their buildings and expand their independent living quarters among other projects.\nIf she could, Carpenter said with a laugh, she’d ask for $190 million, but the celebrations, like their 190th Anniversary Gala on April 20, get the word out about the work their board and employees do. Rain or shine, through the pandemic, during holidays, they are serving their children and families.\n“365 days a year,” said Cathy Yudzevich, Director of Marketing and Development for Vanderheyden. “People forget that.”\nRensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin was also at The Bessy Group Home Wednesday. As big as he is on infrastructure, he reminded the crowd that people are part of the infrastructure, and a place that allows the most vulnerable people in a society to flourish also allows the society to continue to grow and build.\nThe 190-year celebration took place at the Bessy Group Home, an original building and the lone survivor from the 1981 fire that burned down much of the original complex. It is still a group home. (Erica Bouska – MediaNews Group) “If you think about why county governments exist,” McLaughlin said, “it’s social services. That’s why county governments were brought into existence…The work that you do here (at Vanderheyden) is incredible and much appreciated.”\nCarpenter said she hopes those founding women can look at what Vanderheyden has become and be proud of their continued legacy. As previously mentioned, they’ve expanded their services, but they’ve also taken steps beyond what happens inside their facilities.\nOne of the ways is by trying to help a family that’s struggling while the kids are still living at home, she said. If a child is having issues but their home is not unsafe, they’ll have a counselor enter the home and see if they can sort out the issues as they happen, providing an avenue for families to stay together.\nIt’s also about approaching it from an angle of “What has happened to you?” when something bad happens rather than “What is wrong with you?” Carpenter said. There can be a lot of trauma from the lives these kids have been removed from, she said, and understanding that a child will or won’t do certain behaviors because of their experiences is critical.\nSome just need a new approach to everyday occurrences, she said, using an example of a resident who hated showers because they were burned by scalding water as a young child. Teaching them that they controlled the temperature allowed them to do something as simple but essential as taking a shower.\nThey also recognize that there is little to no support for those in the system once they reach a certain age. Foster care shuts off at 18 and all state and federal funding disappears at 21 unless the person has a declared life-long disability.\n1941 Girls Garden Group.

If children are coming from a situation where they don’t have a positive figure to teach them how to get car insurance, to help them with the security deposit on their apartment or even to teach them how to cook meals more advanced than boxed mac-and-cheese, how can they be expected to meaningfully contribute and thrive?\nVanderheyden tries to be that figure for them, Carpenter said, by providing them with group home living, providing work experience at the Vandy or as a maintenance worker on property or by providing them with someone to talk to or be with on Christmas. They don’t want to simply remove them from their potentially dangerous lives; they want to set them up with a good one going forward.\nNow, they have residents who can use their retail skills from the Vandy to work at larger retail stores and had a past resident bring in donuts from the bakery they work at. The kids volunteer as well, Yudzevich said, and they enjoy feeling useful and giving back to their communities.\nMom of a special needs child herself, Troy Mayor Carmella Mantello said she knows how important non-profits and services like Vanderheyden are to the community. They must protect their most vulnerable and at the end of the day, it’s all about their kids.\n“Quality of life dominos into good schools, safe neighborhoods,” Mantello said Wednesday. “Vanderheyden is a part of that.”\nState Sen. Jake Ashby, President and CEO of Vanderheyden Karen Carpenter and Troy Mayor Carmella Mantello. (Erica Bouska – MediaNews Group) Mantello presented Vanderheyden with a proclamation from the City of Troy commending their work. State Sen. Jake Ashby who was also in attendance presented a proclamation as well on behalf of the State Senate.\nThe Benevolent Society of Troy originated in 1800, making them just 24 years younger than the US. Carpenter said they never forget the legacy of their job and their goals.\n“I think for all of us it’s important to mark history and to mark the dedication that so many people have had over decades and decades and decades,” Carpenter said. “We want to give them (the residents) the attention that they need to be good citizens.\n“We’ve got lives in our hands,” she continued. “I again go back to that legacy of that group of women from the Benevolent Society of Troy that says ‘We must take care of our community,’ and that’s what we’re trying to do today.”",

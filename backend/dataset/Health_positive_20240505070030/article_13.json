TORONTO, April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The [Super Patch Company](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4132058-1&h=4101927432&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsuperpatch.com%2F&a=Super+Patch+Company) has announced the formation of a prestigious advisory board composed of renowned medical doctors, scientists, and physical therapists.

For example, [research](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4132058-1&h=2089263816&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superpatch.com%2Fhow-the-tech-works&a=research) by Paul Doghramji, Derek Dietze and Peter Hurwitz focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a novel haptic vibrotactile trigger technology (VTT) embedded in a non-pharmacologic, non-invasive sleep patch. The purpose was to compare the experiences of patients using the VTT-enabled sleep patch with those using a control patch without the technology. Key Findings: - Significant improvements were observed in sleep quality, duration, and insomnia severity scores among participants using the VTT-enabled sleep patch. - Patients reported reduced time to fall asleep, increased hours of sleep, and enhanced overall sleep quality after using the VTT-enabled patch. - The majority of participants expressed satisfaction with the convenience and ease of use of the VTT-enabled patch, preferring it over traditional oral medications for sleep. - Quality of life components, including daytime fatigue, mood, and cognitive function, showed notable improvement in patients using the VTT-enabled patch. - Conversely, participants using the control patch without VTT technology did not experience similar improvements in sleep quality or quality of life measures. Researchers write that this innovative technology may reduce the reliance on traditional pharmacological treatments for sleep issues. Similar studies have taken place regarding the effects of reducing pain.

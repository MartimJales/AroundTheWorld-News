He stated this on Thursday while speaking at a gathering held at the Governor House and attended by noted social media influencers from Karachi. Tessori told the digital media content creators that he had been continuing with his mass-scale charitable work without drawing any salary as governor. He said that up to 350,000 deserving people had benefited from the food ration drive conducted by the Governor House to serve the destitute people without any discrimination. He said that some 180,000 aggrieved people had so far availed the facility of the “Bell of Hope” installed outside the Governor House to ensure speedy justice to the complainants who didn’t get instant relief from different state and government authorities. Tessori told the social media influencers that 50,000 students had been getting the latest Information Technology education at the Sindh Governor House free of charge. He said the free IT education programme launched under the governor’s special initiative was being expanded to Hyderabad, and so far 10,000 students had obtained registrations to attend the free IT course in Hyderabad.

[Genexia](https://genexia.co/), founded by [Kelly Cohen](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/cohenky?_gl=1*4irl95*_ga*MTgzMTUxMzg1NS4xNzA0MjI0OTU0*_ga_7H1FCKXZ4Y*MTcxMjIzOTI4OS4yNC4xLjE3MTIyNTY1ODUuOC4wLjA.), Dino Martis and Anoop Sathyan, aims to [use explainable AI in mammograms](https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2024/02/startup-develops-ai-to-diagnose-coronary-artery-disease.html) for early detection of coronary artery disease to significantly reduce deaths and quality of life degradation for women. Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States and worldwide. In the U.S. alone, 500,000 women die annually as a result of heart disease. “Women are not as fortunate. the symptoms are not that observable as with a man,\" said Cohen, who survived a heart attack. \"I hope that our technology would make the difference and provide women with the chance I was provided.\" The technology wouldn’t require any additional tests. “By attaching this diagnostic to the mammogram, which they conveniently and regularly engage with, we are now able to proactively identify coronary artery disease for women who previously would have been not diagnosed,” Martis said.

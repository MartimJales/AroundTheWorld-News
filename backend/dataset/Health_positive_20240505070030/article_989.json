    "text": "By Editor ,\n6 hours ago Bloodworks Northwest this week announced the launch of its three-month “1,000 Thank Yous” campaign, aimed at expressing gratitude for donors across the Pacific Northwest for their heroic efforts to maintain a safe and reliable blood supply as well as highlighting the critical need for blood.\nThe nonprofit blood center relies on the support of one thousand people walking through donation center and blood drive doors every day to meet the demands of hospitals in the region. Despite only 3 percent of the community donating blood, the continuous flow of approximately 1,000 donors daily is essential to ensure an adequate blood supply for patients in need. The “1,000 Thank Yous” campaign is a heartfelt gesture of appreciation for this selfless act of giving.\n“We cannot thank our donors enough for continuously showing up to supply hospitals with lifesaving blood,” said Sue Nixon , Executive Vice President of Community and Donor Engagement at Bloodworks Northwest. “When we think of serving hospitals all across the Pacific Northwest, one thousand people have to donate every single day to have the blood on hand and ready for the patients who need it. The fact that generous people save one another’s lives and that you can do that too, that’s what the 1,000 Thank Yous campaign is about.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

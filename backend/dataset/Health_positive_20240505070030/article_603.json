Go to https://nanohearingaids.com/ to see how they can help you get your hearing back. The Challenges Faced By VeteransThe team at Nano Hearing Aids appreciates that, as a veteran, you have a unique set of circumstances that may be impacting both the way you access medical care and your financial standing. Nano also appreciates that as well as other challenging injuries and disabilities, hearing loss and tinnitus are two of the most common physical injuries endured by veterans. If you’re suffering from hearing issues, Nano reassures you that millions of other veterans are in the same boat. OTC Hearing Aids Just For YouIf you are suffering from perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, they want to give you the information you need to start understanding which hearing aids might be best for you. If you are on a tight budget and are struggling to pay for your other healthcare and daily needs, they recommend their OTC models, which are ideal for perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Nano Hearing Aids believes that their OTC models, which you can buy without the need for medical intervention, can help you if you feel disenchanted with the system or you don’t want to rely on slow and cumbersome disability support.

Their base level aids start from $297 RRP and offer you up to 12 hours of battery life per charge, a small portable charging battery case, and two listening programs. More advanced models give you extra features like: Bluetooth connectivity for in-app controlmultidirectional microphonesand more listening modes. Picking The Right Hearing AidsIf you have perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, Nano Hearing Aids recommends you consult their new online guide to see whether OTC aids are right for you, and to learn more about the benefits of this type of technology. Their spokesperson said, “If you have been disconnected from the fullness of sound for a while, it can also be an adjustment.

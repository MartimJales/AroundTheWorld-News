    "text": "Nebraska Medicine offering pain therapy touted as alternative to opioids OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Dr. Kody Moffatt developed knee pain three years ago. He’s a sports medicine provider at Children’s Nebraska, and said he knew the pain was not sports-related. “The arthritis devolved to the point that my only option was surgery,” he said. For his recovery, he wanted a different way to treat the pain, largely because of his concern over taking opioids. “They’re very helpful, but we need to respect them,” Moffatt said. “I try to prescribe them as little as possible. If there are ways to treat pain without using opioids, they should be considered.” He said Nebraska Medicine orthopedic surgeon Dr. Beau Kildow suggested a pain relief treatment called [iovera](https://www.iovera.com/). It’s a handheld device that injects liquid nitrogen gas into specific nerves in the surgery area before the operation. “It temporarily freezes the nerves off around your knee, hoping to decrease that pain signal that gets back to your brain,” Kildow said. He said one 30-minute session can provide pain relief between three and six months, and that it has pretty high success. “It doesn’t work on everybody, unfortunately,” Kildow said. “Kind of in our practice—or what I’m seeing—is about a 70 percent success rate where the patient does feel some sort of pain relief.” Nebraska Medicine began offering the treatment around 2020. Any surgery patient is qualified for it, unless they have a skin lesion or rash. Kildow said he has only used it for knee surgery patients, but that it can be used for the shoulders and ankles too. In Moffatt’s case, he says he walked out of the hospital after each of his knee replacements, and he was able to stop taking opioids after three days. “The joint pain and the bone pain that I would expect to experience with this type of surgery was gone,” he said. “I had none of it, which then allowed my physical therapist to be a lot more aggressive with my rehab.” Kildow said on top of being addictive, side effects from opioids include dropping blood pressure, constipation, sleepiness and dizziness. “Especially in our field of work, where we do have to prescribe opioids for our patients for pain control, trying to find other modalities to cut down on that is key.” Ortho Nebraska also offers iovera.

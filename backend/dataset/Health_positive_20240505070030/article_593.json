    "text": "FDA study shows Xolair can lessen severe reaction to food allergies LA CROSSE, Wis. (WEAU) - The drug Xolair has been available for more than 20 years, and while it’s is normally used to treat asthma, a recent study lead the FDA to approve it to help those with food allergies. “The study included things like cashew, hazelnut, walnut, egg, milk, and wheat. As of last week the FDA approved it for IgE-mediated food allergies,” says Samantha Knox. Samantha Knox is a pediatric allergist at Gundersen Health System and she is excited to see this medication be used to help treat those who deal with allergies. “I think it’s really showing us a pathway that we’ve been able to target some of those the food allergy pathway and help treat those patients who have multiple food allergies and who have had anaphylactic reactions,” says Knox. The study has shown that the drug can increase the amount of allergenic food that a person can consume. “In most cases it’s 100 milligrams or less of the food protein with a bite reaction. That’s if we accidentally take a bite of a cookie or candy and it has our allergen in it. What they’re looking at was more of like 1,000 milligrams or a few nuts or a larger portion of their milk or egg, which was a really good indication that this was helping to protect those accidental exposures,” says Knox. While the drug helps prevent reactions, Knox warns that it is not a cure and people should still be careful. “It does not resolve your allergy. It is not something that we can see modify your immune system such that it sustains, thus far. There’s lots of research to be done here after to see how long this lasts and for how long that needs to be done,” says Knox. Xolair is administered through an injection that is given every 2-4 weeks. Knox says this medication is the first of its kind to be indicated for IgE-mediated food allergies. Copyright 2024 WEAU.

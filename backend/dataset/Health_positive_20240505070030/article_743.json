EatingWell's Editorial Guidelines Trending Videos Close this video player Photo: ANTONIS ACHILLEOS If weight loss is your goal, meal prep can be your friend. But even well-intentioned goals to have produce and protein at the ready can fall by the wayside if your week is thrown a curveball, leaving an abundance of fresh produce or raw chicken spoiling in your fridge. Don’t let this all-too-familiar image scare you into ditching your goals. Instead, lean into convenient options that don’t require a ton of prep work in the kitchen. A good place to start? Canned foods. How to Set Weight-Loss Goals You Can Actually Achieve Are Canned Foods Healthy? Yes! There should be no shame in the canned-food game! Canned foods are packed with nutrition and come in handy to make meals happen when time is tight. Past research published in Nutrients found that diets higher in nutrient-dense canned foods (in addition to fresh foods) had a better overall diet quality than those that rarely included canned foods. Specifically, nutrients we tend to fall short on—potassium, fiber and calcium—were consumed in higher amounts by people who incorporated canned foods into their eating plan. “Overall, canned foods can be one good, convenient and low-cost source of nutrient-dense foods,” says Caroline Young, M.S., RD, owner of Whole Self Nutrition. “In my practice, many of my clients need to lean on convenience during high-stress times, and canned foods can be invaluable to them, making it possible to eat produce and plant-based proteins.” 9 Best Canned Foods for Weight Loss 1. Canned Artichoke Hearts Canned artichoke hearts in water are a staple in my kitchen. Artichokes are one of the highest-fiber vegetables on the market, with a half-cup serving of the canned beauties clocking in at 4 grams of filling fiber (or roughly 16% of the Daily Value) and just 35 calories, per the USDA. Remember, fiber helps keep you fuller for longer, minimizing mindless munching between meals. While preparing fresh artichokes can be a bit cumbersome, popping open a can of artichoke hearts is a breeze. Place them in a colander under cool running water to rinse off some of the sodium, and then add to pizza, pasta and egg dishes. We recommend trying our Artichoke & Red Pepper Frittata or Creamy Artichoke Pasta. 2. Canned Beans Arguably one of the most versatile canned products on the market, canned beans continue to be a dietitian’s go-to staple. For reference, ½ cup of black beans provides 8 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein, plus micronutrients like iron, calcium and potassium, per the USDA. “Canned beans are a nutrition powerhouse that keep you satisfied long after you’ve eaten,” says Christy Wilson, RDN, owner of Christy Wilson Nutrition, LLC, a nutrition communications business. While some concerns arise around the sodium content of canned beans, earlier research in the Journal of Culinary Science & Technology shows rinsing canned beans under cool running water can reduce the sodium content by up to 41%. If you’re looking for more inspiration on what to do once you open up that can, consider one of our 12 Budget-Friendly Recipes to Make with a Can of Beans. 3. Canned Corn Contrary to what you may have read online, you do not need to avoid starchy vegetables, like corn, if you are looking to lose weight. “Corn holds up well to canning and can be used to add fiber and color to salads, pizza, sauces and much more,” says Elana Natker, M.S., RDN, a nutrition consultant with Sage Leaf Communications. Canned corn is available packed in water, making the sodium content negligible for those watching their blood pressure. A half-cup serving of canned corn provides 2 grams of filling fiber and 2.5 grams of protein, as well as other nutrients like potassium, folate and choline, per the USDA. The 6 Best Frozen Vegetables You Should Be Eating for Weight Loss, According to Dietitians 4. Canned Lentils Canned lentils are a game-changer when it comes to making meals happen fast. “If you don’t feel like cooking lentils from scratch, it’s perfectly fine to use the canned variety. Canned lentils are one of my go-to plant-based proteins because they have protein and are packed with fiber. Those two nutrients keep you full and help with weight-loss goals,” says Natalie Rizzo, M.S., RD, author of Planted Performance and owner of Greenletes. According to the USDA, ½ cup of canned lentils provides about 8 grams of protein and 7 grams of filling fiber. However, because they are often canned with salt, they can have a high sodium content. Rizzo suggests rinsing them, just as you would canned beans, to reduce their salt content. Upgrade your lunch salad by popping open a can of lentils and making our Mixed Greens with Lentils & Sliced Apple. 5. Canned Pineapple If you struggle selecting fresh pineapples in the market, then Wilson suggests turning to the canned fruit aisle. “Bright, fresh and always delicious, I know that canned pineapple is a sure shot. It's sweet, perfectly sliced and ready to eat as a snack or as a nutritious sweet ending to my meal,” says Wilson. Savoring the flavor of naturally sweet fruits can be a great swap if you find yourself craving a sweet snack during the day. While there’s nothing wrong with a little bit of added sugar from a cookie, if your goal is weight loss, finding ways you can satisfy your sweet tooth with a food like fruit can help set you up for success. A half-cup serving of canned pineapple (in water) provides an excellent source of vitamin C, per the USDA. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, two factors that can hamper weight loss, according to a review in the International Journal of Medical Sciences in 2020. 6. Canned Pumpkin While pumpkin may trend during the fall months, Rizzo recommends canned pumpkin year-round for weight loss. “Canned pumpkin is a staple in my pantry. It’s rich in the antioxidant vitamin A, which is known for its role in eye health. And it’s a simple, tasty and healthy addition to soups, sauces and baked goods,” she says, adding that you can use canned pumpkin to swap out some of the oil or butter in baked goods. When picking up your canned pumpkin, you’ll want to look for canned pumpkin that contains 100% pumpkin puree, without added sugars or salt. Incorporate canned pumpkin into your diet with our Pumpkin Overnight Oats. 7. Canned Salmon Convenient and ready to eat, canned salmon is a great go-to protein source. “Canned salmon is a powerful protein that helps keep you full and gives you heart-healthy EPA and DHA omega-3 fats. You don’t want to avoid fats when trying to lose weight, especially not heart- and brain-friendly omega-3s,” says Natker. A 3-ounce portion of canned salmon packs 20 grams of protein alongside those heart-healthy omega-3s, per the USDA. Upping your protein intake is a good idea when trying to lose weight. Studies have evaluated the use of high-protein diets for weight loss, and the results are promising. A 2020 article published in the Journal of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome found that eating high-protein can safely help with weight loss while preserving lean mass (like muscle). Maintaining muscle during weight loss can help you keep weight off long-term. Need some inspiration? Check out these recipes created with a can of salmon. 8. Canned Tomatoes A close runner-up in popularity to canned beans are canned tomatoes. “Canned diced tomatoes are a favorite of mine since they’re also versatile. You can use it in place of pasta sauce since it has less sugar,” says Natker. For reference, a half-cup serving of canned tomatoes packed in tomato juice with no added salt has just 20 calories and provides 2 grams of fiber, 1 gram of protein, 12 milligrams of sodium and 3 grams of total sugars (with no added sugars), per the USDA. Canned tomatoes also provide lycopene, an important heart-healthy antioxidant. 9. Canned Tuna Similar to canned salmon, canned tuna is another great protein option to add to your pantry stash. A 3-ounce portion of canned tuna provides 22 grams of high-quality protein as well as calcium, potassium and omega-3 fatty acids, per the USDA. Plus, it’s affordable, easily fitting into many weight-loss meal plan budgets. There are quite a few canned tuna options on the market now, including no-salt-added tuna and tuna packed in oil or water. The best choice to make is the one that meets your goals for weight loss. Tips for Choosing Canned Foods While canned foods can (and should) be part of your kitchen arsenal, dietitians recommend keeping these tips in mind as you stock up and sort through your canned food inventory. Opt for low-sodium or no-salt-added options. Rinse canned foods under cool running water if you have high blood pressure or are watching your sodium intake. Check the ingredient label. Foods canned with sauce or syrup may include added sugar.Check the expiration date. Canned foods have a long shelf life, but they don’t last forever. Go through the cans you have on hand. Use those with the closest expiration date first, then store them in your pantry using the FIFO (first in, first out) method. Avoid purchasing cans with dents, bulges or cracks of any sort. Eat canned foods only from cans that are sealed, free from dents and smell and look fresh when opened. Do Canned Foods Expire? The Bottom Line Canned foods are a wonderful addition to a balanced diet, whether your goal is weight loss or not. While there are a variety of options to choose from, dietitians recommend stocking up on a variety of canned beans, fish such as canned salmon and tuna, and canned vegetables and fruits, like tomatoes, corn and pumpkin. Dietitians encourage you to get creative with your “cantry” and see what new canned foods will become part of your regular rotation. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

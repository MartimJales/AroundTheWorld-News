    "text": "Wellness Counseling , a private therapy practice in New Jersey offering support and empowerment in the Montclair community, is excited to announce the ongoing supportive mom group at its Montclair location. The weekly gatherings aim to provide a safe space for mothers to connect, share experiences, and find solidarity in their journey through parenthood. Led by professionals Ali Whitney, a Licensed Associate Counselor, and Heather Picinch, a Licensed Social Worker, the Wellness Counseling mom group offers a platform for mothers to seek guidance, gain insights, and foster meaningful connections with fellow moms. Recognizing the immense demands placed on mothers, the program prioritizes self-care, mental wellness, and mutual support. Scheduled every Wednesday evening at Wellness Counseling's Montclair location, the mom group promises a safe and inclusive environment where mothers can freely express themselves, seek advice, and build a strong support network. The sessions, facilitated by experienced counselors, encourage open dialogue, exploration of challenges, and celebration of triumphs of motherhood. Additionally, Wellness Counseling recognizes the importance of supporting families as a whole. In conjunction with the mom group, a concurrent program is offered to middle schoolers, providing a nurturing environment where youth can engage with peers, receive support, and develop essential coping skills. Led by Dana Shabo, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, and Heather Picinch, a Licensed Social Worker, the middle school community workshop offers a safe space for adolescents to navigate the challenges of adolescence. Through group discussions, activities, and peer interaction, participants are empowered to explore their emotions, build resilience, and develop healthy coping mechanisms. The dual programming not only supports mothers in their quest for self-care and mental wellness but also provides a valuable resource for families by addressing the unique needs of adolescents during a pivotal stage of development. Participants in the mom group can rest assured that their children are in capable hands, engaging in meaningful activities and receiving support from qualified professionals.

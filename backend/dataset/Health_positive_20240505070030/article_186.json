    "text": "[Maple Leaf Foods](MapleLeafFoods.com) and the Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security commend the Government of Canada's commitment to invest $1 billion over the next five years to establish a National School Food Program. This initiative, in collaboration with provinces and territories, aims to expand existing school food programs, reaching an additional 400,000 children across Canada. \"Maple Leaf Foods and the Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security express gratitude for the federal government's dedication to creating a National School Food Program,\" stated Sarah Stern, executive director of the Maple Leaf Centre for Food Security. Addressing the critical issue of food insecurity, Stern emphasized, \"One in four children in Canada live in food insecure homes. Food security is vital for health, dignity, and academic success. Historically, Canada has lacked a national school food program, making this investment a significant step towards rectifying this gap.\" Stern highlighted the importance of collective efforts, acknowledging, \"This commitment builds on decades of advocacy by food security advocates. Collaborating with experts, governments, and stakeholders, we will work towards implementing a healthy meal program in every school, benefiting millions of children and families facing food insecurity.\" Looking ahead, Stern emphasized ongoing collaboration and urged governments to set ambitious targets to reduce food insecurity by 50% by 2030.",

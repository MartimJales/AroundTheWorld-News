    "text": "Hearing Aids For Veterans: Invisible OTC Models Are Affordable & Easy Choice\n[Hearing At Home LLC](/hearing-at-home-llc/) - Thursday, April 4, 2024.\nIf your time serving America in the United States Army has left you hard of hearing, Nano Hearing Aids wants to help. If you don’t know where to begin when it comes to hearing aids and devices, they are committed to making things clear.\nGo to\nhttps://nanohearingaids.com/ to see how they can help you get your hearing back.\nThe Challenges Faced By Veterans\nThe team at Nano Hearing Aids appreciates that, as a veteran, you have a unique set of circumstances that may be impacting both the way you access medical care and your financial standing.\nNano also appreciates that as well as other challenging injuries and disabilities, hearing loss and tinnitus are two of the most common physical injuries endured by veterans. If you’re suffering from hearing issues, Nano reassures you that millions of other veterans are in the same boat.\nOTC Hearing Aids Just For You\nIf you are suffering from perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, they want to give you the information you need to start understanding which hearing aids might be best for you.\nIf you are on a tight budget and are struggling to pay for your other healthcare and daily needs, they recommend their OTC models, which are ideal for perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.\nNano Hearing Aids believes that their OTC models, which you can buy without the need for medical intervention, can help you if you feel disenchanted with the system or you don’t want to rely on slow and cumbersome disability support.\nInvisible CIC & BTE Options\nAll of their models are invisible—which Nano has seen is particularly preferred by veterans like you—with both completely in canal (CIC) or subtle and hidden behind the ear (BTE) options available.\nTheir base level aids start from $297 RRP and offer you up to 12 hours of battery life per charge, a small portable charging battery case, and two listening programs. More advanced models give you extra features like:\n- Bluetooth connectivity for in-app control\n- multidirectional microphones\n- and more listening modes.\nPicking The Right Hearing Aids\nIf you have perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, Nano Hearing Aids recommends you consult their new online guide to see whether OTC aids are right for you, and to learn more about the benefits of this type of technology.\nTheir spokesperson said, “If you have been disconnected from the fullness of sound for a while, it can also be an adjustment. Therefore, an amazing customer support team, we believe, is as important as world-class research and development. With no sales pressure. We’re here when you’re ready, whatever that looks like. Small hinges can, indeed, open big doors.”\nLet Nano help you get your hearing back at\nhttps://nanohearingaids.com/\nHearing At Home LLC\n511 South Royal Lane\nCoppell\nUnited States\nhttps://hearingathome.com/\nAbout Hearing At Home LLC\nContact info\nCompany: Hearing At Home LLC Address: Coppell 511 South Royal Lane Email: ab@clearviewcom.com Phone: +1 (404) 822-3309 Website: https://hearingathome.com/\n[More about Hearing At Home LLC](/hearing-at-home-llc/)\nContact info\nMedia Inquiries Hearing At Home LLC 511 South Royal Lane Coppell United States https://hearingathome.com/ ab@clearviewcom.com",

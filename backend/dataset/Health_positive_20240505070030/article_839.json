    "text": "SAN DIEGO — San Diego Community Power is flipping the switch on the energy marketplace, delivering cleaner and more affordable electricity to nearly a million customers in San Diego County. CEO Karin Burns joins our Laura Cavanaugh to share how SDCP is leading the region in green solutions for a brighter future. As San Diego’s locally run, not-for-profit electricity provider, San Diego Community Power is on a mission to procure 100 percent clean and renewable energy by the year 2035 or sooner, and to do so in a way that is equitable, affordable and sustainable. “We started in 2019. We served our first customer in 2021. And today we’re serving over one million customer meters across San Diego,” said Burns. “The way it works is we buy solar, wind, geothermal. We buy those resources from power developers. We send that energy through the poles and wires of SDG&E. And then the customer receives one bill that includes our portion and the portion of SDG&E.” SDCP serves nearly one million customers in San Diego, Chula Vista, Encinitas, Imperial Beach, National City, La Mesa and the unincorporated County of San Diego. Utility and electricity rates impact us all in San Diego. That is why San Diego Community Power is working to keep costs down for customers. “This year our board approved our recommendation to reduce our rates by 18 percent compared to last year,” said Burns. “And entering into partnerships with groups like Ohm Connect, we’re working on launching programs that will help folks use less energy that will help them shift energy into less expensive, lower cost parts of the day. We’re buying our renewable resources with 20 year power purchase agreements. And that helps reduce costs and stabilize them.” Learn how San Diego Community Power is working for you at www.sdcommunitypower.org Sponsored by: San Diego Community Power",

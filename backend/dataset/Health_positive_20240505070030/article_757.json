    "text": "The first patient to receive a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig has fared so well that he has been discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, just two weeks after the groundbreaking surgery. The transplant and its encouraging outcome represent a remarkable moment in medicine, scientists say, possibly heralding an era of cross-species organ transplantation. Two previous organ transplants from genetically modified pigs failed. Both patients received hearts, and both died a few weeks later. In one patient, there were signs that the immune system had rejected the organ, a constant risk.But the kidney transplanted into Richard Slayman, 62, is producing urine, removing waste products from the blood, balancing the body's fluids and carrying out other key functions, according to his doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital. The procedure brings the prospect of xenotransplantation, or animal-to-human organ transplants, significantly closer to reality, said Dr. David Klassen, the chief medical officer for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the nation's organ transplant system. \\\"Though much work remains to be done, I think the potential of this to benefit a large number of patients will be realised.\\\"Whether Slayman's body will eventually reject the transplanted organ is still unknown, Klassen noted. There are other hurdles: A successful operation would've be replicated in numerous patients and studied in clinical trials before xenotransplants become widely available. If these transplants are to be scaled up and integrated into the healthcare system, there are \\\"daunting\\\" logistical challenges, he said, starting with ensuring an adequate supply of organs from genetically engineered animals. The cost too, he said, may be a substantial obstacle.",

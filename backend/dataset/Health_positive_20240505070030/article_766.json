    "text": "Mice can cause a lot of damage around your home and spread germs and diseases, so it's best to take steps to prevent them. While homeowners commonly use mouse traps and other lethal solutions to eliminate mice, there are other options. You can repel mice with one simple herb by planting it around your home and garden. That herb? Mint. Mice have a powerful sense of smell, and menthol can irritate their nasal passages, so they will often avoid it. Adding mint plants to the inside of your home can be as helpful as planting them in your yard. In addition to protecting your home from mice, naturally repelling mice from your garden is also a good idea. Mice not only eat plants in the garden, but they can also introduce bacteria and diseases to your plants.\nThe best place to plant mint is near any mice entry points and anything you want to keep mice away from. This could include inside your home, shed, or garden. However, mint grows rapidly and aggressively and could take over your garden if you're not careful. Whether adding mint plants to your yard or bringing them inside, it's a good idea to keep them in containers. Remember that mint tends to grow as a perennial in USDA growing zones 3 to 8. It's best to plant your mint at the right time of year and grow it in partial shade, although full sun can work in some climates.\nHow to use mint for the best results\nFreshsplash/Getty Images In some regions, it may not be convenient to plant mint. If this is the case, you can add dried mint leaves to strategic areas instead. Alternatively, add some mint essential oil to a cotton ball and place it anywhere you want to repel mice. However, you'll need to regularly replace either of these options to ensure they keep doing their job.\nWhen aiming to repel mice, ensure that you don't rely on mint alone. It's best to use mint alongside other tactics for getting rid of mice humanely . You'll also need to keep your home clean and eliminate food crumbs. If repellents don't work for you, you may need to resort to lethal methods for eliminating mice or call in professionals to ensure your home and garden remain rodent-free. Mint may not work on some mice or may not work reliably for long. Since mice may grow accustomed to the smell, this repellent may also become less effective as time goes by.",

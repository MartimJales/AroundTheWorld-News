    "text": "Healthycell REM Sleep, a gel-delivered sleep supplement, significantly improved various metrics of sleep quality, including time spent in deep sleep and overall sleep efficiency, in a new study.\nKey Takeaways:\n- SleepScore Labs analyzed 822 nights of sleep across 26 healthy participants, finding that Healthycell REM Sleep significantly enhanced multiple aspects of objective sleep quality, such as falling asleep faster and spending more time in deep sleep.\n- Participants using Healthycell REM Sleep reported improvements in their perceived sleep experiences, including a 24% easier time falling asleep and a 43% increase in their ability to sleep through the night without waking.\n- The study’s results have been submitted for presentation at SLEEP 2024, the annual joint meeting of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.\nA gel-delivered sleep supplement, Healthycell REM Sleep, was found to significantly improve multiple aspects of objective sleep quality in a recent study by\nSleepScore Labs, a sleep research and technology company.\nObjective sleep quality was measured using SleepScore Max, a non-contact monitor designed to unobtrusively measure sleep at home.\nSleepScore analyzed 822 nights of sleep across 26 healthy research participants revealing that Healthycell REM Sleep significantly improved multiple aspects of objective sleep quality compared to the baseline period of the study when no sleep supplements were used.\nStudy Findings\nWhen using the gel sleep supplement Healthycell REM Sleep, the research participants experienced improvements\nin falling asleep faster, spending more time in deep sleep (+3.2 hours/month), fewer awakenings throughout the night, and less time spent awake during the night. Furthermore, improvements were observed in the metrics of sleep efficiency and sleep maintenance, and there was an increase in average SleepScore, an objective indicator of overall sleep quality.\nImportantly, in addition to the improvements in objectively measured sleep, participants reported improvements in their perceived sleep experiences. When using Healthycell REM Sleep, participants felt adequately sleepy when going to bed more nights per week. Consequently, they reported finding it easier to fall asleep (+24%) and being able to fall asleep in their preferred amount of time more nights per week.\nParticipants also noted a significant increase in their ability to sleep through the night without waking (+43%). Their perception of overall sleep quality increased (+33%) and they reported feeling satisfied with their sleep more days per week. In the mornings, they felt well-rested more days per week.\nQuality Sleep Is Key\n“Sleep is critical to overall health,” says Healthycell CEO Doug Giampapa, in a release. “Our REM Sleep microgel is formulated to help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and sleep deep, so we are thrilled to see the clinical data quantifying its impact on supporting better sleep.”\nColin Lawlor, CEO of SleepScore Labs, adds in a release, “Given the importance of sleep, the consumer is looking for real data and evidence behind solutions in the market. We are delighted to work with Healthycell on this project to objectively study the impact of their products”\nResults of the study have been submitted for presentation at\nSLEEP 2024, the annual joint meeting of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.\nPhoto caption: Healthycell REM Sleep\nPhoto credit: SleepScore Labs",

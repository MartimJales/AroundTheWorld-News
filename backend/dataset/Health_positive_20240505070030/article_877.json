    "text": "Background\nOsteosarcoma (OS) is a tumor of bone. Xanthohumol (XN) has been found to have antitumor effects. However, it is not known whether XN can prevent the development of OS.\nMethod\nThe malignant phenotypes of OS cell lines were evaluated using CCK-8, clone-formation, EdU, Transwell, and wound-healing assays. The molecular mechanism of XN action was investigated by transcriptome sequencing. mRNA levels in OS cells were examined by q-PCR and protein by western blotting and immunofluorescence, while Ki-67 and PCNA levels in tumors were assessed using immunohistochemistry.\nResults\nXN dose-dependently blocked proliferation, migration, and invasion in OS cell lines. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that EFEMP1 expression was significantly reduced after XN treatment, which was shown by rescue assays to have a tumor-suppressive effect. Reduced levels of EFEMP1/PI3K/AKT axis after XN treatment were demonstrated by western blotting.\nConclusion\nXN blocks OS tumorigenic behavior by inhibition of the EFEMP1/PI3K/AKT axis.",

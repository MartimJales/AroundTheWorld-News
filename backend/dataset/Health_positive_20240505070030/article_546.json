    "text": "On March 16th, a medical team at Massachusetts General Hospital achieved a groundbreaking milestone in the field of transplantation by performing the first-ever living recipient transplant of a genetically modified pig kidney.\nThe recipient, Richard Slayman, is a 62-year-old man who has been suffering from end-stage kidney disease. The successful surgery marks a significant advancement in medical science as it opens up a new avenue for organ transplantation that could help save countless lives in the future.\nThe transplant procedure involved using a pig kidney that had undergone 69 genetic modifications, removing harmful pig genes, and introducing specific human genes to enhance compatibility with humans. The kidney was donated by eGenesis in Cambridge and genetically modified using CRISPR-Cas9 technology . Additionally, the pig kidney was subjected to further modifications to eliminate the risk of infection in humans by deactivating porcine endogenous retroviruses.\nThe hospital attributed the triumph of the procedure to years of research, preclinical studies, and collaborative efforts by a team of medical professionals led by Dr. Leonardo V. Riella, Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, and Dr. Nahel Elias.",

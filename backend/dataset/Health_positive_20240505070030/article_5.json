    "text": "It's been almost 20 years since Judy Bailey read her final news bulletin and, since then, she has immersed herself in a range of foundations, causes and campaigns.\nNow, the former broadcaster has written a book called Evolving — to help prepare people for ageing.\nSpeaking to Breakfast, she said she's written a memoir before, and found it \"cathartic\".\n\"I was able to revisit my old haunts, which was an interesting process for me. [But] this book was more different, I had do more research. I wanted to learn things for the purposes of the book, but also for myself.\n\"People told me that old age wasn't for sissies, so I thought I better navigate it. I think all of us want to be health and happy.\n\"As you age, you experience a lot of change, obviously change in body, but also relationships and work, when you finally leave employment it can be a really difficult time, you sometimes lose sense of who you are.\n\"So it takes a moment to create a new life for yourself but the most important thing is relationships.\"\nBailey said the Harvard longitudinal study found that relationships are \"profoundly protective\" as people age.\n\"So having someone close to you who cares for you, it doesn't have to be a partner but you need contact and warmth.\"\nShe said it doesn't matter how much money you have, although owning a home does help a lot.\nWhat surprised Judy about getting older \"People say boomers are all about themselves, but they're the fifth biggest bank in New Zealand.\"\nAsked what surprised her the most when writing the book, Bailey said: \"I think I was most surprised about dementia - nearly 40% is either preventable or delayable.\n\"What is good for your heart is good for your brain, so steer clear of sugar, flour, salt, processed dairy.\n\"Looking after yourself and socialising is particularly important and also looking after your hearing.\n\"So many people delay getting hearing aids and become disconnected from society — avoiding social gatherings.\"",

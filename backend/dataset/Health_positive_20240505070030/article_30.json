    "text": "In this article I’ve been in the flaky-skin club since I was on Accutane as a teen, so I’m always looking for products to keep my skin moisturized . My hunt often led me to post-shower products — like body lotion s and oils — but what I’ve learned while reporting this story is that what you use in the shower can actually set the stage for healthy, less-dry skin in the first place. Enter: hydrating body washes. Thanks to ingredients like glycerin and hyaluronic acid, a moisturizing body wash can help replenish your skin’s barrier, restoring its suppleness and even preventing further dehydration. If your skin is dry, too — or you’re just trying to manage seasonal dryness — I’m here to help you navigate the body-wash aisle. I tested several formulas myself and interviewed dermatologists about the ones they recommend to patients with dry skin, which can range from temporary inflammation to skin that’s also acne-prone . For an even more comprehensive list of body washes, head over to my roundup for all skin types — and to get Strategist-approved beauty advice straight to your inbox, sign up for our Beauty Brief newsletter . What we’re looking for Ingredients According to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hope Mitchell , founder of Mitchell Dermatology , a body wash’s ability to combat dryness lies in its moisturizing, skin-barrier supporting ingredients. Look for ultrahydrating ingredients like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides, which will help to attract and retain moisture in the skin. Emollients like shea butter, coconut oil, or jojoba oil can also help to soften and smooth rough, dry skin. Additionally, Mitchell recommends opting for mild surfactants like sodium lauroyl sarcosinate or coco-glucoside, which ensure effective cleansing without stripping away the skin’s natural oils. And finally, I’ve done my best to prioritize body washes with simple formulas and minimal ingredients, which helps to further minimize irritation for dry-skin types. Scent Many of the dermatologists I interviewed explained that fragrance-free body-wash formulations are preferable for dry-skin types. “Synthetic fragrances and drying foaming agents can cause irritation and dry skin, so I would recommend avoiding those as much as possible,” explains Dr. Steve Xu , founder of Sibel Health and head of the medical advisory board at Geologie . If you are someone who has dry skin but still wants the option of fragrance — I know I do sometimes — I’ve made a note of which formulas are scented or unscented below. Best body wash for dry skin overall Ingredients: Glycerin, linoleic-rich oils, squalane | Scent: Fragrance free If you’ve read any of our other body-care coverage — like our list of the best body lotions for dry skin — you’ll find that Naturium is widely praised (and loved by us) for having some of the most intensely hydrating formulas on the market. With that in mind, I knew the brand’s Glow Getter Multi-Oil would be important to test for this story. And after using it consistently for about a month, I can honestly say it lives up to the hype. The Glow Getter is silky and lightweight, lathers quite well despite being oil-based, and never leaves any trace of greasiness after my shower. It’s formulated with a blend of linoleic-rich oils, which is major for those of us with dry skin because, as our writer and resident beauty expert Tembe Denton-Hurst puts it, linoleic acid “helps to make similar lipids to the ones already existing in our skin (a.k.a. ceramides), which helps with hydration and keeping moisture in.” It also contains a whopping 50 percent glycerin plus squalane, ingredients that are considered staples in many products formulated specifically for dry skin. While I usually go for scented body washes, the fact that the Glow Getter lacks a strong fragrance hasn’t bothered me because I’m getting the results I want: My dry skin is soft, smooth, and, dare I say, radiant. I never feel the need to smear on a moisturizer after showering. I’ve also started using the Glow Getter on my legs when I’m shaving because it creates the perfect glide for my razor. (If you want to avoid oils — say if your skin is acne-prone — another favorite from Naturium is the Booster , which the brand just launched last month. It’s a rich gel-like body wash infused with hyaluronic acid and comes recommended by board-certified dermatologist Dr. Connie Yang of PFRANKMD by Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank .) Best (less expensive) body wash for dry skin Ingredients: Glycerin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid | Scent: Fragrance free I’ve used CeraVe’s Hydrating face wash on and off over the years, but I hadn’t tried the brand’s body wash until recently — and so far, I’m impressed. The face- and body-wash formulas are similar in texture (a soft and creamy gel-to-foam), though the body wash is definitely heavier and less runny. The formula leaves my skin feeling smooth, and it suds up more easily than Naturium above (it’s also a few bucks less, which never hurts). CeraVe is a favorite brand of dermatologists, and two that I spoke with for this story recommended this body wash. Emmy Graber, board-certified dermatologist and founder of the Dermatology Institute of Boston , likes that it’s formulated with three essential ceramides, which are super-hydrating and work to repair the skin barrier. Dr. Amanda Doyle, a board-certified dermatologist at Russak Dermatology , adds that there are “very few patients that would be sensitive to this.” The CeraVe has also received a seal of approval from the National Eczema Association, which means it’s free of irritants and allergens that can lead to eczema flare-ups . And while it’s technically unscented, I think it still leaves skin smelling clean and fresh. Best body wash for extremely dry skin Ingredients: Glycerin, niacinamide, coconut esters, sunflower esters | Scent: Fragrance free Those with very dry skin will benefit from a deeply hydrating shower oil like this one from Bioderma, which also appears in my roundup of the best body washes for every skin type. I’ve included the oil-based formula here because it’s a favorite of Strategist staffers (more on that below) and dermatologists, including Dr. Noëlle S. Sherber, co-founder of Sherber + Rad and clinical associate professor of dermatology at George Washington University , who notes that “it cleanses while restoring moisture to the skin.” After testing this body wash herself, our editor Maxine Builder says a little goes a long way: “I use about two full pumps for my legs and lower body and two full pumps for my arms and chest and upper body,” she says. Builder likes to apply it after she’s shaved or exfoliated because the heavier texture helps to alleviate the feeling of skin tightness; meanwhile, Sherber notes that it offers a nice slip to the skin, making it a more hydrating alternative to shaving cream . Best body wash for dry sensitive skin SEEN Body Wash Ingredients: Glycerin, bisabolol, hemisqualane | Scent: Fragrance free If your skin is dry and sensitive , then SEEN’s body wash is the one for you. The nonirritating and noncomedogenic formula includes ultrasoothing bisabolol and glycerin, a powerful humectant that “helps the skin absorb and retain moisture, keeping the treated areas more hydrated and soft,” Doyle says. Like the CeraVe above, this SEEN formula is approved by the National Eczema Association , so it’s considered safe for sensitive or eczema-prone skin. (Just note that although this one contains no added fragrance, you may notice it has a slight scent — according to the brand , this is because of the raw ingredients.) Best ultragentle body wash for dry skin Ingredients: Aloe vera, chamomile, lavender | Scent: Unscented “For my patients with very dry or sensitive skin, I often recommend formulas designed to be mild enough for babies,” says Sherber, whose top choice is this two-in-one shampoo and body wash from New York–based brand Paloroma . Because it’s formulated to work for newborns, it contains nourishing chamomile, calming lavender, and moisturizing aloe vera, which all work together to soothe and protect delicate baby skin. Sherber also likes that it’s free of “common irritants such as high concentrations of essential oils” and is without synthetic fragrance, parabens, phthalates, silicones, sulfates, dyes, and petrolatum. Best body wash for dry inflamed skin Ingredients: Glycerin, shea butter, aloe vera, niacinamide | Scent: Unscented If you’re dealing with inflammation caused by dryness — which can range from tiny patches of redness to more significant reactions — I’d go for this La Roche-Posay cleanser. When I tested it, I loved that it created an almost cooling effect when it first touched my skin, providing instant relief in some of my driest areas, like on my arms and legs. And even after patting myself off with a towel post-shower, those once-rough patches felt soft for hours. Mitchell and Sherber both recommend it, too, and Sherber specifically likes that “it’s formulated to be suitable for facial skin, which is thinner and more sensitive than body skin.” The ingredients list includes glycerin and shea butter for hydration, plus La Roche-Posay’s proprietary thermal water, which “is famed to be super soothing,” Sherber says. The formula also includes aloe vera, which has calming, anti-inflammatory properties. I found the consistency to be similar to La Roche-Posay’s gel-based face washes : It pumps out as a thick translucent lotion but turns into a milky foam when combined with water in the shower. Best body wash for dry acne-prone skin Ingredients: Glycerin, glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid | Scent: Fresh, tropical Those with dry and acne-prone skin will want to look for a body wash that features enzymatic exfoliants , which work by clearing away dead skin cells without fully absorbing into the skin, helping to prevent further irritation and breakouts. Sherber recommends this cleanser from Kosas, which she told me is formulated with facial-quality actives and combines exfoliating papaya and pineapple enzymes with a mild concentration of AHAs (alpha-hydroxy acids, such as glycolic or lactic acid) for additional pore-clearing benefits. It also has hydrating glycerin to keep skin from drying out, making it my pick for those with dehydrated skin that’s prone to breakouts. Best scented body wash for dry skin Ingredients: Glycerin, ginger root extract, aloe vera, chamomile | Scent: Apple, cucumber, and green tea If you really can’t go without using scented products in the shower, this purifying body wash from Red Flower is the one Strategist senior editor Winnie Yang uses on her drier skin. It’s made with omega-6, which promotes moisture retention, plus soothing cucumber, chamomile, and green tea. Yang, who uses it “every day, all year long,” describes the scent as being “a low-key floral with a little mystery to it,” adding that the fragrance doesn’t stay on you all day (a plus in her book).

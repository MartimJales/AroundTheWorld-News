    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nBig Sean aims to tell his story about mental wellness in his first book.\nOn Wednesday, April 3, the Detroit native has teamed up with Simon & Schuster's Simon Element to publish his debut book . In a video he posted to his Instagram timeline, Sean explains how he started his mission of self-realization by embracing methods his mom showed him when he was a child. He also revealed the moment he was inspired to write a book about his mental health journey after he appeared on Jay Shetty's podcast . Afterward, he announced the title of his book Go Higher.\n“Besides the music, another project that’s been years in the making and it’s finally time,” he declared. “I can’t even believe it for real. But anyone who know me since I signed my record deal knows if you look at my old YouTubes, I’ve always been about speaking from the heart, following your intuition and checking in with yourself mentally, because that’s how I was raised.”\nAccording to a press release, the book is \"filled with step-by-step instructions for the tools Sean has been using on a daily basis for the last decade—journaling, agreements, affirmations, and meditation, as well as prompts to guide you on your own journey of self-reflection.\" The book comes amid all the new music Sean has released.\nLast month, he dropped a freestyle in which he talks to the \"Old Sean\" over a classic J Dilla beat. He also debuted his latest single \"Precision\" at the end of his set at Rolling Loud in California, and dedicated his upcoming track \"On Up\" to his newborn son Noah during his \"Tiny Desk\" performance . His latest releases is leading up to his forthcoming album coming soon.\nBig Sean's first book drops October 8, 2024.",

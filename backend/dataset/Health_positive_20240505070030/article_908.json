    "text": "The General Council of Physicians and the General Nursing Council have announced a new collaboration to implement a Comprehensive Care Program for Nursing Professionals. This program, inspired by the successful Comprehensive Care Program for the Sick Doctor (PAIME), aims to promote the health and well-being of nurses.\nThe main objective of this protocol is to provide nursing professionals with the support they need in terms of health promotion, prevention, and care. The program will offer voluntary access and rehabilitation for nurses facing health issues, such as mental health or addiction problems. It will also ensure that healthcare workers undergoing treatment receive the necessary care with confidentiality and professional secrecy.\nThe presidents of the General Councils of Medicine and Nursing, Tomás Cobo Castro and Florentino Pérez Raya, praised the initiative, highlighting the importance of ensuring that healthcare professionals are able to provide the best possible care to their patients.\nTomás Cobo emphasized the significance of sharing their experience with other health professions, while Florentino Pérez Raya stressed the importance of supporting nurses who may be struggling with mental health issues and care overload. The program represents a significant improvement in the healthcare system’s ability to care for those who care for others.\nThis collaboration between the General Council of Physicians and the General Nursing Council signifies a positive step towards ensuring that nurses receive the support they need to carry out their vital work effectively.",

    "text": "Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer has invested an undisclosed amount of capital in healthtech platform Curelo. His investment was part of an INR 10 Cr funding round raised by the startup. It also saw participation from IIMA Ventures (IIM Ahmedabad's startup incubator), US-based family offices, and Zee5 cofounder Tarun Katial.\nThe fresh proceeds will be utilised to expand Curelo’s footprint, standardise unorganised labs, and shore up growth.\nFounded in 2022 by Arpit Jayswal, Curelo is a healthtech platform that aggregates diagnostic labs across the country and offers one-stop solution for home sample collection for lab tests.\nIyer, commenting on his investment, said, \"I'm pleased to be a part of Curelo's journey… They have an innovative and customer-friendly approach to diagnostics and healthcare, and I am excited to contribute to its growth.”\nMeanwhile, Curelo founder and CEO Jayswal said, \"We are delighted to welcome Shreyas Iyer as an investor in Curelo. His belief in our platform adds immense value as we continue to redefine the diagnostic market. This collaboration positions us as a trusted brand with accelerated growth and reinforces our commitment to serving the evolving needs of our users.\"\nPrior to the latest funding round, the Delhi NCR-based startup raised $100K from IIMA Ventures in October last year.\nCurelo claims to have seen its revenue by more than 25X in the past one year and has set its eyes on acquiring 300% more patients by 2025.\nWith the investment, Iyer has become the latest Indian cricketer to invest in startups. While Hardik Pandya backed kids' footwear brand Arreto and D2C food startup Yu last year, Mahendra Singh Dhoni invested in creatortech startup Rigi and fitness startup Tagda Raho in 2023.\nShikhar Dhawan also pumped an undisclosed amount of capital in D2C snack brand TagZ Foods last year. Just days ago, cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle invested an undisclosed amount of capital in online cricket gaming startup Hitwicket\nThe fundraise comes at a time when the ongoing funding winter has dried up the capital for the healthtech sector. The funding raised by Indian healthtech startups tanked 83% to $233 Mn in 2023 from $1.4 Bn in 2022.\nDespite this, funds continue to trickle into the space. In January, CureBay bagged INR 62 Cr in its Series A1 funding round led by Elevar Equity. In February, healthtech startup Aarogya Tech also raised $1.8 Mn in a seed round led by Hersha Group owner Hasu P Shah.\nThe post Cricketer Shreyas Iyer Invests In Healthtech Startup Curelo appeared first on Inc42 Media.",

    "text": "Sponsored Content Bee pollen has been all over social media in the last year, with people claiming the benefits range from combatting menstrual and hormonal issues to increasing the size of “the girls.” While there’s something to many bee pollen’s benefits, the quality ranges wildly between products. Like many supplements that go through a boom period, there are a lot of poor-quality imitations on the market with next to no brand credibility or testing for purity, but that does have an excellent website. Fortunately, if you’re wondering if bee pollen is for you, we have a list of the few companies that can be trusted to deliver the goods. Thus, you can get the health benefits of bee pollen without wasting your money on honey-colored sawdust. It’s also important to note that the compounds in bee pollen vary depending on the plant source and the season it was collected. For example, bee pollen collected from pine plants has approximately 7% protein, while pollen collected from date palm packs closer to 35% protein. The minerals and vitamins vary depending on the bee pollen as well. And, of course, people with a pollen allergy should avoid bee pollen. Different Forms of Bee Pollen There are essentially four different forms of bee pollen available: dried bee pollen, pollen in pill form, and then fresh and freeze-dried bee pollen, sometimes called bee pearl or bee bread, which are the ones you want. Freeze drying retains all nutrients, amino acids, and phytoestrogens and is much more easily stored; it’s also often what people mean when talking about fresh bee pollen. Dried bee pollen (unless it’s freeze-dried) is collected in its fresh form but undergoes a drying process that significantly reduces its nutrient values. Pollen in pill form is also dried and often contains more fillers than pollen, providing fewer health benefits. It’s also worth noting that royal jelly provides many benefits of bee pollen, so the best bee products contain a good amount. The Best Bee Pollen Supplements Below are our picks for [the best bee pollen supplements](https://becomingtrendy.com/best-bee-pollen-brand): - Kittie - Greenbow - Serenol Kittie – The Best Bee Pollen Supplement Overall Technically, [Kittie](https://becomingtrendy.com/kittie-formula) has two products that contain Spanish bee pollen: their greens powder, which is an exciting product for women in general, but that’s not what we’re focusing on, as this list is purely bee products. Kittie Bee Pearl contains the original royal jelly and beeswax, which are responsible for many benefits of bee pollen, especially for the immune system. Kittie does standardize for the flavonoids (the compounds that have any impact on health) such as quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin, as well as the phenolic acids like ferulic acid and coumaric acid. This is the good stuff that makes bee pollen work. The other good thing about Kittie Bee Pearl is that it’s dosed correctly, which aligns with the few studies on bee pollen. Maximize all potential health benefits with 2500mg of bee pollen and 500mg of royal jelly. This, in theory, covers everything from seasonal allergies and menstrual issues to antioxidants, heart and liver health, and even wound healing. - Pros - Reputable brand - Good dosage - Includes royal jelly, too Cons - Only available from their [website](https://becomingtrendy.com/kittie-formula) Greenbow – Best Certified Organic Been Pollen While it is technically quite challenging to guarantee a bee pollen product is 100% organic (because bees collect pollen from all over the place, and they don’t know if the flowers have been sprayed or not), Greenbow is as good as you’re going to get on that front. Their price point is pretty good at $20, and the quality is solid; it doesn’t have the royal jelly, but if you’re looking for something decent from Amazon, Greenbow is the way to go. There are more than enough reviews to support Greenbow as a product—it is good, straightforward bee pollen. Pros - Good price - Organic - Lots of reviews Cons - Could have royal jelly Serenol Serenol is a bee pollen-based PMS supplement that offers a natural solution to ease the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Utilizing bee pollen’s properties, it aims to alleviate common issues associated with the menstrual cycle. Although its marketing is a bit overhyped, it works for some people. Although there’s more evidence that bee pollen can help menopause than PMS, it still suggests some hormonal benefits. Focusing on simplicity and effectiveness, Serenol addresses mood swings and emotional distress that often accompany PMS. Its formula taps into the natural benefits of bee pollen to provide relief without the need for artificial additives. Serenol’s approach reflects a commitment to natural healing, providing a straightforward option for those seeking relief from hormonal fluctuations. Harnessing the power of bee pollen offers a pragmatic solution to the challenges of womanhood. If you’re looking for a PMS supplement, we recommend Kittie. They offer a combined supplement of bee pollen and other ingredients for the same price. We know we’re gushing about them, but we struggled to find three good brands for this list. Pros - Reputable brand Cons - Overpriced for what it is Choosing the Best Bee Pollen Supplement When selecting a bee pollen supplement, several factors should be considered to ensure you get a high-quality product that meets your needs. Here are the top considerations: Freshness and Source Freshness is crucial when it comes to bee pollen. Look for a reputable brand that keeps their bee pollen refrigerated or frozen during storage and transportation. Generally, Spanish bee pollen is considered the gold standard, although that’s not essential. Fresh bee pollen should dissolve into a powder when touched, while dried pollen will remain in its granular form with a rugged exterior shell. The freeze-dried powder is usually fine, but it must be frozen. Additionally, consider the source of the bee pollen. Opt for bee pollen sourced from reputable beekeepers prioritizing sustainable and ethical practices. Quality Control and Testing Choose a bee pollen supplement that undergoes rigorous quality control and testing processes. The manufacturer should test the pollen for purity, ensuring it is free from contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metals, and microbial pathogens. Look for supplements that have third-party certifications or adhere to industry standards to ensure the highest quality and safety. Storage and Packaging Proper storage and packaging are essential to maintain bee pollen’s freshness and potency. Ensure the supplement is stored in a well-sealed container to prevent exposure to moisture and air. Some brands may also offer individually sealed packets for added convenience and freshness. Recommended Dosage Follow the manufacturer’s recommended dosage instructions. Start with a small amount and gradually increase the dosage to assess your tolerance and response. It’s important not to exceed the recommended dosage to avoid potential adverse effects. Additional Ingredients Some bee pollen supplements may contain additional ingredients, such as vitamins, minerals, or other herbal extracts. Consider your specific health needs and preferences when choosing a supplement with extra ingredients. Read the product label carefully to ensure you know all the ingredients included.

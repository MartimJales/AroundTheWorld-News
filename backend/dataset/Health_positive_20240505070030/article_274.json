    "text": "Man who received pig kidney transplant, a world first, returns home\nRick Slayman, 62, left Massachusetts General Hospital on Wednesday with the\ncleanest bill of health he’d had in a long time. He described the homecoming as one of the happiest moments of his life. Roughly two weeks ago, he received a genetically altered pig kidney after suffering from end-stage kidney disease.\nWhy is this transplant such a big deal? Stayman is the first living person to successfully receive a pig kidney transplant, Massachusetts General Hospital said in a\nstatement last month. The pig kidney came from an eGenesis facility in Cambridge, Mass. The Food and Drug Administration had approved the transplant, according to eGenesis.\nScientists at eGenesis had genetically edited the pig donor with CRISPR-Cas9 technology to make its organs more compatible with humans. The researchers also eliminated certain viruses that could infect a human organ recipient.\nWhat does all this mean? The success of the transplant could signal a breakthrough in transplant science that could help save thousands of lives. Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Mass General hopes the transplant approach will offer a lifeline to millions of kidney failure patients around the world.\nMore than 800,000 people in the United States alone suffer from end-stage renal disease or kidney disease, according to a\nhttps://egenesisbio.com/press-releases/egenesis-announces-worlds-first-successful-transplant-of-genetically-engineered-porcine-kidney-in-a-living-patient/ by eGenesis. A transplant is considered the best treatment for the condition, but demand for transplants far outpaces supply. Roughly 90,000 people on the U.S. organ transplant list are waiting for kidneys, according to eGenesis. Physicians perform only about 25,000 of the procedures each year across the country.\neGenesis says that if its human-compatible donor organs prove viable, they could help meet the shortage and provide an alternative to dying without a transplant.\nDig deeper:\nRead R. Albert Mohler Jr.’s column in WORLD Opinions examining whether it is morally appropriate to use pig organs in humans.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism,\nclick here.\nAn actual newsletter worth subscribing to instead of just a collection of links. —Adam\n[Sign up to receive The Sift email newsletter each weekday morning for the latest headlines from WORLD’s breaking news team.](/the-sift)",

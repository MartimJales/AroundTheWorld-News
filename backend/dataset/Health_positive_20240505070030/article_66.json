Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members!\nDownload the app.\nWhen I started practicing yoga in college about a decade ago, I was still figuring out who I was. While attempting to balance newfound independence, heartbreak, and restlessness, I had a strong desire for something more. I found that in yoga. It helped me come back home to myself and recover my inner strength.\nNow, as a longtime student and teacher of yoga, I’ve begun to notice the timeless life lessons my practice has shared with me. There are likely an infinite number of insights I’ve received from my practice during the last decade. And I’m certain, as time goes by, I’ll become aware of even more. But there are currently 101 graces that I can think of to share. As you read through, maybe they’ll also resonate with you and remind you of the marvelous and multifaceted gift of yoga.\n101 Life Lessons Yoga Continues to Teach Me\n1.

But don’t turn them into gods.\n23. No one is perfect.\n24. Everyone makes mistakes.\n25. Caring for your physical space is caring for yourself.\n26. The study of self is a never-ending journey.\n27.

You don’t have to find something else to do just because you’re waiting in line.\n37. The best things in life aren’t things.\n38. We are responsible for the Universe.\n39. Because we are the Universe.\n40. Life is a continuous dance of opposing energies.\n41. You can either try to control them or let them flow.\n42. We often choose unnecessary resistance.\n43. But it’s equally accessible to choose ease.\n44. There are few things that Child’s Pose can’t help with.\n45. Be constantly humbled by the world around you.\n46.

You carry a wealth of insight and power.\n63. Everything you need is already within you.\n64. You are not a human doing.\n65. You are a human being.\n66. It’s not about how much you got done.\n67. It’s about if you have a life filled with joy.\n68. And love.\n69. We can see further when we learn from those who have come before us.\n70. Always invite more grace.\n71. Never be judgemental.\n72. Including about yourself.\n73. Use your blocks.\n74. Not your ego.\n75. Sometimes, a good yin class can be even more potent than a power flow.\n76. Yoga is way more than just postures.\n77.

And it will never be perfect.\n101. And that’s okay.",

(NASDAQ:LOOP) (the \"Company\" or \"Loop\"), a clean technology company whose mission is to accelerate a circular plastics economy by manufacturing 100% recycled polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\") plastic and polyester fiber and Bormioli Pharma, an international leader in pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices, today announced that an innovative pharmaceutical packaging bottle manufactured with 100% recycled virgin quality Loop™ PET resin will be unveiled within the Bormioli booth at Pharmapack Europe 2024.\nBormioli Pharma and Loop Industries aim to introduce market-ready solutions for the global pharmaceutical industry and the two companies began to collaborate over a year ago in order to achieve this goal. Bormioli Pharma tested Loop™ PET resin in its packaging, commissioning to independent third parties' additional analysis to verify extractables levels with different solutions, also taking in consideration the worst-case scenario. The results of these tests set a new benchmark for recycled plastic products within the pharmaceutical industry, as the bottles produced with Loop™ PET resin do not release any substance deemed of toxicological relevance1.\nBormioli Pharma's EcoPositive offering, gathering low-impact packaging solutions, currently constitutes 50% of their standard catalogue, contributing to position itself among the players with the broadest sustainable offerings on the international market.\nIn addition to the independent third-party testing commissioned by Bormioli Pharma, LoopTM PET resin was also tested by a worldwide leader in laboratory testing services and on December 13th, 2023 Loop announced that test results confirmed its Loop™ PET resin meets the strict requirements and standards outlined by the European Pharmacopeia (Ph.Eur. 3.1.15, Polyethylene Terephthalate for Containers for Preparations not for Parenteral Uses) and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP <661.1>, Plastic Materials of Construction) and is compliant for use in packaging applications in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\"Through this collaboration with Loop we're strengthening our role as a solid, quality and reliable partner for the pharmaceutical industry\" stated Andrea Lodetti, CEO of Bormioli Pharma . \"Loop Industries shares our values and commitment, and together we made available a new pharma-grade sustainable solution, showing even greater safety standards than traditional ones.\"\nDaniel Solomita, Founder and CEO of Loop Industries , commented \"Through our collaboration with Bormioli Pharma, we have developed an innovative pharmaceutical packaging solution manufactured from 100% recycled virgin quality LoopTM PET resin. This high-quality packaging alternative raises the bar for responsible solutions and helps set a new standard for sustainable packaging in the pharmaceutical industry.\"\n1 Results from an extractables study conducted by an independent, external lab and performed on bottles manufactured with Loop™ PET resin using different simulating solutions.\nAbout Bormioli Pharma\nBormioli Pharma works closely with the pharmaceutical industry and all companies that are working towards the future of healthcare globally.

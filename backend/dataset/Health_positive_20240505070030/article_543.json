    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — On its mission to help prevent veteran suicide, the nonprofit Veterans Counseling Veterans brings community awareness to topics that can be difficult to talk about.\nWhat You Need To Know Veterans Counseling Veterans works to prevent veteran suicide\nIts third annual Military Sexual Trauma Conference will be held April 5-7\nSessions will focus on healing family and relationships Founder Tony Williams says he started the organization to make sure veterans had support from other veterans.\n“We’re always taught to take care of the team, not us as individuals, and that’s one of the reasons why it’s difficult for us to get help, because we’re not taught that way,” he said.\nDuring Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the third annual Military Sexual Trauma Conference — which will be held April 5-7 — will focus on healing families and relationships.\n“If you strengthen the family, you strengthen the veteran,” said Williams.\nArmy veteran Christy Hinnant says she knows how much that support can help. As a survivor of sexual assault, she has attended the conference before and will share her healing journey the year.\n“Being sexually assaulted impacted my entire life, because instantly it broke my trust,” said Hinnant. “I just felt like my world was absolutely unraveling.”\nThe then 18-year-old says she was assaulted off base. The teen was going home after training as she prepared for her first assignment in Germany.\n“I started to have symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, but at the time, I didn’t know what any of that was, I had never experienced any of that,” said Hinnant.\nShe says it took six attempts to find a therapist who was a good fit.\n“I started to realize there was a big gap in the aftercare,\" she said.\nTrying to close that gap, Hinnant started the nonprofit Voices Against Sexual Assault in 2019.\n“We provide individual coaching and counseling, as well as support groups, and we conclude it all with a healing voices retreat so that victims know that they are not alone,” she said.\nTo help other survivors find their voices, Hinnant became a licensed mental health counselor and started her own practice.\n“I can relate, she said. \"I understand being in the darkest of darkest moments where you’ve thought about taking your life or you thought there wasn’t a light at the end of the tunnel, you didn’t know where to go.\"\nHinnant advised relatives and loved one of survivors to \"just support your loved one that experienced trauma, just be there for them.\"\n“There’s a light at the end of the tunnel,\" she added. \"There’s power in your story and you can get through it.\"\nAs Hinnant shares her story, she said she continues to heal, and hopes the power of her voice as a survivor can help make a difference.\nSpace at the conference is limited. It will be held at the USF Joint Military Center. For more information, email info@vetscounselingvets.org",

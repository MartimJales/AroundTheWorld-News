    "text": "While everyone deserves the opportunity to eat healthy, Houston‚Äôs Sunnyside neighborhood has historically been overlooked for fresh food options. SEE ALSO: KPRC 2‚Ä≤s Our Town series was in the Sunnyside community üåû Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre covering Most of the folks in Sunnyside live more than a mile from a supermarket or large grocery store. Roughly 30% are transportation insecure. The two combined have created a crisis of food inaccessibility. ‚ÄúWhen I walked across that bridge leaving the hospital, I had no clue what I was going to turn this into.‚Äù Determined to turn the tide of food insecurity, Ivy Walls courageously made the decision to trade her career in health care for a calling and started Ivy Leaf Farms. That was almost four years ago back in August 2020. ‚ÄúMy 1st grant that I received was from Beyonce and the NAACP. And they helped us. You know, soil is very expensive. They helped us get the soil so we could grow this. When I started growing vegetables, it was an outlet to bring some of those things to my community. What we harvest, we take over to Fresh Houwse grocery . We participate in the Black Farmer Box, which is a collective of Black farmers here in the city,‚Äù Walls said. Since its inception, Walls said Ivy Leaf Farms has been embraced by the community. ‚ÄúI would honestly say that I‚Äôm everybody‚Äôs little sister, auntie, and friend,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been an amazing reception. We‚Äôre part of such a beautiful aspect of connecting people back to nature as well as growing food.‚Äù In hopes of igniting a revolution in the way her community thinks about fresh food, Walls wanted to make a bold statement. So, she embraced the SLAB car culture and bought a vintage green 1974 Catalina. ‚ÄúWhy not green to do the salad SLAB. And so something that resonates culturally as well as its fun and cool and people take a picture and share it and the movement can keep going and going and going. It just tells a bigger story. Like meeting people where they are at. I mean, you could tell people to eat healthy all day long, no matter what socioeconomic class, right? It‚Äôs a task,‚Äù Walls said. Walls added that what‚Äôs been accomplished in Sunnyside can be replicated in other communities across Houston. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with Acres Homes, Trinity Gardens, Kashmere Gardens to implement, you know, the food pathways that they have. When we think about food insecurity, we have to think about ourselves as a community, as one big community. That if we‚Äôre not shopping locally, or growing locally, our food system, at any moment could change. I think we have to be realistic about whose stories we‚Äôre uplifting and whose narratives we‚Äôre going to lean into. I think when it comes to the success and the notoriety that Black Farmers have created, it‚Äôs the fact that we are truly the neighborhood personified. That‚Äôs the spirit of Sunnyside. Can‚Äôt hide that Sunnyside pride,‚Äù Walls said.",

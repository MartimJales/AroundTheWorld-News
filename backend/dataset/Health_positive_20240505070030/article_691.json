So, what are you waiting for? Grab your ingredients and get ready to whip up this culinary masterpiece! With its ease of preparation and incredible flavor, this Salmon en Croûte recipe is sure to become a new favorite in your household.\nIngredients For the Salmon en Croûte:\n1 lb (500g) puff pastry (thawed) 7 oz (200g) smoked salmon 7 oz (200g) processed cheese, grated 1 egg, beaten for egg wash Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish) Spring onions, chopped (for garnish) For the Roasted Potatoes:\n1 lb (500g) potatoes, chopped into bite-sized pieces Olive oil Salt Pepper Paprika powder 4 tbsp yogurt 1 tbsp mayonnaise 1 tbsp mustard Lemon juice (to taste) Oregano Fresh parsley and spring onions (for garnish) Instructions Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Prepare the potatoes: In a bowl, toss your chopped potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika powder. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast them in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until golden brown and tender. While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the Salmon en Croûte: Unfold the puff pastry dough and gently roll it out on a lightly floured surface. Spread the grated processed cheese evenly over the pastry dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Next, lay the smoked salmon on top of the cheese, making sure it covers most of the surface. Carefully roll the puff pastry dough around the salmon, creating a log shape. Pinch the seams to seal the pastry closed. Brush the entire pastry with the beaten egg wash. Transfer the Salmon en Croûte to a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and flaky. Prepare the sauce while the Salmon en Croûte is baking: In a small bowl, whisk together yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Once everything is cooked through, it’s time to plate! Arrange the roasted potatoes on a serving plate. Top them with slices of the delicious Salmon en Croûte. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and spring onions. Drizzle with the creamy sauce and enjoy!",

    "text": "NORTH BOSTON, N.Y. — The Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) released its 2023-24 Academic All-Conference team on Thursday, April 4, including 94 Penn State Altoona student-athletes. The AMCC’s yearly Academic All-Conference team recognizes student-athletes from institutions across the league for achieving cumulative grade-point averages of 3.2 or higher, through the fall 2023 semester. Individuals on the list who compiled GPAs of 3.5 or higher earned a greater status of recognition, being tabbed as Peak Performers. The 2023-24 AMCC Academic All-Conference team is comprised of 1,067 student-athletes from the conference’s member schools, including both full and affiliate members. This year, a total of 94 Penn State Altoona student-athletes earned spots on the AMCC Academic All-Conference team. Out of that group, 59 student-athletes were recognized as Peak Performers. Additionally, 24 Penn State Altoona student-athletes were marked for induction into Chi Alpha Sigma, the national college student-athlete honor society.",

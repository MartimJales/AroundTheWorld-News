Kristin Leest, the visionary behind Simply Standard Poodles, LLC, a renowned breeding establishment of American Kennel Club Champion bloodline Standard Poodles based in Charleston, South Carolina, is embarking on an exciting new venture. With her extensive background in dog training and pet nutritional health, Leest is proud to introduce her own brand of natural pet powder supplements, designed to empower pet parents in addressing the escalating challenges in pet health. Recognizing the struggles faced by pet owners, particularly those with particularly those with hip and mobility issues, allergy issues, nervousness, anxiety, and the need for quality nutrition, Leest's new line of supplements offers a straightforward solution. Each product is meticulously crafted to minimize fillers, additives, colors, and dyes, reflecting her commitment to purity and effectiveness. At the core of Leest's expertise is her dedication to breeding and raising standard poodles of exceptional quality. These dogs often go on to serve as support animals, compete in American Kennel Club competitions, or become beloved family companions. Drawing from this wealth of experience, Leest's supplements cater to a diverse range of health needs for dogs and cats. Pet parents can choose from a variety of formulations, each targeting specific health goals such as hip and joint support, calming aid, comprehensive daily support for seniors and puppies, allergy relief, digestive health, immune system enhancement, and more. What sets Leest's approach apart is her commitment to customization. Upon visiting her website, pet owners can complete a complimentary quiz detailing their pet's health history. In response, Pawsitivity, Leest's personalized platform, generates a tailored plan designed specifically for their furry friend. Having navigated the challenges of pet care firsthand, as a devoted pet parent herself, Leest empathizes with the struggles faced by others. The frustration of trying to provide a healthy diet while avoiding harmful fillers and additives is a sentiment she understands intimately. It's this empathy that fueled her mission to develop a line of nutritional supplements that offer bespoke solutions for all pets. The outdated notion of a one-size-fits-all approach to pet nutrition is a sentiment Leest seeks to challenge. She understands that the dietary needs of a highly active hunting dog differ significantly from those of a sedentary older canine. With her supplements, Leest aims to usher in a new era of personalized pet care, where each animal's unique requirements are recognized and catered to.

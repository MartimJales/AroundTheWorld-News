    "text": "Hi,\nI have received my diagnosis of ' superficial moderatley differentiated squamous cell carcinoma' in the right buccal mucosa and in one weeks time I will have a CT and MRI scan.\nI received a copy of the doctors letter to the gp where he states my tnm to likely be T2 N1 MX .\nFirstly , my reading ( hospital given info) does not mention an X and I'm wondering if this means unknown or don't want to predict?\nSecondly, should I take this as what is happening right now or not? Can this change or become very different after my tests?\nWould they have said if it was hpv related? I was asked a lot about relatives being from western seaboard or relatives with this type of cancer so this leads me to believe they think I've inherited it.\nThanks in advance\nWhatever cancer throws your way, we’re right there with you.\nWe’re here to provide physical, financial and emotional support.\n© Macmillan Cancer Support 2024 © Macmillan Cancer Support, registered charity in England and Wales (261017), Scotland (SC039907) and the Isle of Man (604).

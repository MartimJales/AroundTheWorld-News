    "text": "Does your new pet need its shots? This weekend,\nPetco Love’s Vaccinated and Loved Initiative is hosting a free pet vaccine event Saturday, April 6.\nThe\nAnimal Care Society in Louisville will provide free vaccinations to pets in the Louisville area. The vaccines come from Petco’s initiative, which is set to provide over one million free pet vaccines to pets in need.\nThe event is primarily for dogs and cats. Here are the vaccines offered for free to your furry friends:\n- Dogs: Parvovirus and distemper\nCats: Panleukopenia\nPetco Love said in a statement that these are the most prevalent deadly diseases affecting pets, but are preventable with simple vaccines available at this event.\nPaid vaccines are also available at the event, including vaccines for rabies and Bordetella for $10, heartworm and microchipping for $25 and flea, tick and heartworm preventative medicine “at a low cost,” according to a release from Petco Love.\nAccording to Petco, an estimated 30% of all pet owners do not take their pet to a veterinarian annually for preventative care, either due to neglect or economic reasons.\nThe Animal Care Society said the effort this weekend aims to vaccinate 500 pets in 2024. Vaccines will be administered on a first come, first serve basis.\nAnimal Care Society\n12207 Westport Rd.\nSaturday, April 6\n9 a.m. - 12 p.m.",

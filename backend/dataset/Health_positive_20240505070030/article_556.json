    "text": "It can be difficult to run a long distance, especially if it’s your first marathon. Some runners neglect to pay attention to their diets while pushing the boundaries of their physical endurance in preparation for the big day. It can be confusing to know what to eat in advance of a marathon and how much fuel to consume before, during, and after the run. Luckily, you can figure out what your body needs to finish the race by paying attention to your nutrition, staying hydrated, and doing some experimentation during your preparation. In addition to assisting you in optimizing your performance, this will facilitate your journey toward success. Prepare yourself for success Having a good eating plan is just as vital as your running strategy. Selecting foods high in nutrients is a smart move when training. A diet high in oily meals and samosas will not make you perform at your best. A well-balanced marathon diet should include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats. Carbohydrates are the macronutrient on which you should concentrate the most. Protein is also essential because it supports lean muscle, aids in healing, and helps avoid injuries. Hydrate yourself prior to, during, and after your runs. In order to get ready for the next training session, you must adequately hydrate and restore nutrients after each one. Be smart about your meals Many runners eat pasta during the pre-race meal in order to consume a lot of carbohydrates; if that suits you, by all means, do it, but remember to eat in moderation. Try eating meals that are low in fat, fiber, and spice and heavy in carbohydrates and moderate protein. Moreover, you can experiment with more nutritious carbs like whole grains and veggies. Furthermore, don’t forget to eat throughout the days preceding the marathon; dinner is not the only chance you have to fill up on carbohydrates. It’s also critical to keep in mind that people start losing muscle mass around the age of 40 and can lose up to 8% every ten years. This can assist you in obtaining the necessary quantity of protein to prevent your body from using your muscles as fuel for exercise. Do not take a chance Consume what you have consumed on extended training runs. Before your run, you can consider ingesting 25 to 50 grams of carbs every hour. Additionally, resist the urge to sample a new bar you came across that day. For lengthy runs, stay with what you have been trained with. Minor adjustments to your nutrition or increased fluid intake throughout the race can have a detrimental effect on your time. Ensure you eat breakfast and pack wisely Your pre-workout food offers numerous advantages. It suppresses appetite, avoids low blood sugar and associated side effects (dizziness, weariness, and impaired vision), and gives your muscles energy. This meal’s timing is crucial. Food consumed prior to exercise becomes beneficial only after it has had time to break down and absorb. Eat a meal three to four hours before working out, or have a smaller snack one to two hours beforehand, if possible. Depending on your energy demands, whole wheat bread with egg and fruit juice can be a terrific pre-run breakfast. Pack extra water, energy bars, sports drink, recovery nourishment for after the race, and any other meals you often consume on mornings when you go on a long run. It’s beneficial to have energy. 108980990",

    "text": "At the forefront of healthcare simulation innovation, Benjamin Berg, director of SimTiki Simulation Center at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), has been recognized with awards for his outstanding contributions to the field. Berg was recently inducted as a fellow of the Society of Simulation in Healthcare Academy at the 2024 annual International Meeting on Simulation in Healthcare. Additionally, he received a Presidential Citation Award from the Society for Simulation in Healthcare for his exceptional leadership in advancing healthcare simulation. “Recognition by peers and selection for these distinctions is really a recognition of JABSOM,” Berg said. “Professional opportunities and my personal growth in the field of simulation entirely reflect the JABSOM ʻohana and student body, both of which nurture the community of practice from which many significant impacts emerge.” Berg’s career spans over two decades, during which he has dedicated himself to the advancement of academic simulation through research, mentorship, education and training. Under his guidance, JABSOM‘s SimTiki Simulation Center has become an international hub for healthcare students and professionals seeking cutting-edge training opportunities. Hosting numerous international students, the center has solidified its reputation as a premier destination for healthcare simulation education. He recently convened the Inaugural Society for Simulation in Healthcare Asia Pacific Evolution Summit, which drew 21 delegates from eight nations at JABSOM in November 2023.",

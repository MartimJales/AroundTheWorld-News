    "text": "Dozens of pizza lovers, students and Rotarians turned out to Cruiseport Gloucester on Rowe Square on Wednesday evening to munch on pizza and judge which ones were the best during the Gloucester High School Interact Club’s 15th annual Pizza Taste-Off fundraiser to help in the fight against cancer. The event raised about $2,300 with proceeds benefitting the American Cancer Society, Club Advisor Michael Perreault said. The GHS Interact Club, the high school affiliate of the Gloucester Rotary Club, is a community service organization that has been active for decades at Gloucester High; students organize fundraisers during the school year to benefit local, national, international charities. During the fundraiser, about 250 tickets were sold for $10 for adults and $5 for kids 5 and younger to sample slices from nine restaurants from around Cape Ann and the North Shore. The tickets also served as the ballot to judge the pizza pies on “Best Overall,” “Best Crust,” “Best Sauce,” and “Best Specialty Pizza.” GHS Interact students with Perreault ran the event and made sure there were plenty of individual slices on paper plates for participants to take and judge in the four categories. It was a blind taste test, so each paper plate was labeled with a letter A through I corresponding with a participating pizza purveyor. Diners were asked to fill out their tickets, choosing a letter for their favorites in each category, and the tickets became ballots that were dropped in a box to be tallied later. This year’s participants, which donated 10 pies each, were: A. Grillfriends Restaurant, 20 Lexington Ave. in Gloucester. B. Laneside Pub & Brewery at Cape Ann Lanes, 53 Gloucester Ave. in Gloucester. C. Firing Up Pizza and Grill, 721 Gloucester Crossing Road in Gloucester. D. Kettle Cove Catering, 9 Bennet St. in Manchester-by-the-Sea. E. Cape Ann Pizza and Subs 65 Eastern Ave. in Essex. F. Uncle Frank’s Pizza and Subs, 214 Eastern Ave. in Gloucester. G. Ellie’s Pizza. 725 Hale St. in Beverly. H. Magnolia 525 Tavern, 525 Lexington Ave. in Gloucester. I. Five Sons Pizza, 275 Asbury St. in Hamilton. After all the votes were tallied, the winners were: Best Overall: Cape Ann Pizza. Best Crust: Laneside Pub & Brewery at Cape Ann Lanes. Best Sauce: Ellie’s Pizza. Best Specialty Pizza: Lobster pizza from Kettle Cove Catering. Cruiseport Gloucester donated use of its function room for the event.

    "text": "Industry News\nCVS plans to allow no-cost access to OTC birth control pill By Fiona Rutherford and John Tozzi April 04, 2024, 4:34 p.m. EDT 1 Min Read Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\nAdobe Stock CVS Health drug plans will cover over-the-counter oral birth control in the U.S., a step that further removes barriers\nto obtaining oral contraception as reproductive rights\nincreasingly come under fire. Opill, the nonprescription drug from Perrigo, will be added to the preventive services oral contraceptives list and will be covered at no cost\nfor many plan sponsors, CVS Caremark said in a pharmacy update dated March 28. Read more: AT&T and Maven expand fertility benefits to support 125,000 employees\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Opill for nonprescription use last summer, making it the country's first over-the-counter oral birth control. While birth control is free when prescribed by a doctor, state Medicaid programs and insurers aren't required to cover over-the-counter versions, which created potential for patient costs that might make the pill inaccessible to some people.\nRead More: What Alabama's IVF ruling will mean for employees seeking fertility care\nLack of insurance coverage was a concern as Opill hit the shelves of major drugstores, like CVS and Walgreens. Perrigo had suggested a monthly retail price of $19.99, while advocacy groups like Free the Pill\nhave supported a retail price of no more than $15 for a three-month supply. Almost half of the 6.1 million annual U.S. pregnancies are unintended, according to the FDA. Such pregnancies reduce the likelihood that parents will seek early prenatal care and raise the risk of preterm delivery and other adverse health outcomes.\nFiona Rutherford and John Tozzi Bloomberg News",

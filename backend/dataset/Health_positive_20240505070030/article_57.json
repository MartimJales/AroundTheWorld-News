The Gold Seal of Approval is a symbol of quality that reflects Blue Ridge's commitment to providing safe and effective care for the young women they treat.In March of 2023, Blue Ridge Eating Disorder Care Center took part in a rigorous onsite survey that assessed their documentation, building safety, and programming. An organization can only achieve Gold Seal Approval after the accreditation process and a rigorous on-site evaluation.

Blue Ridge Eating Disorder Care Center is committed to the recovery of young women with disordered eating. Located in the serene Pennsylvania countryside, our team of professionals offer individualized treatment for girls diagnosed with ARFID, Anorexia, bulimia, OSFED, binge eating, and more.

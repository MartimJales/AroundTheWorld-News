    "text": "77th Azalea Queen meets with patients and staff at Novant Health WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - “This festival would not have lasted for 77 years without that true, deep connection, and that’s been a joy to witness.” Those were the words from 77th Azalea Queen Sharon Lawrence as she and her court made a visit to Novant Health’s Betty H. Cameron Women’s & Children’s Hospital on Thursday. As part of several visits around the Cape Fear Region, they met with hospital staff and patients to bring a smile to their faces and show them the importance of the healthcare in the Wilmington community. “I had the honor to play a pediatric nurse in a Hallmark film called Hearts of Christmas. I’m going to say the name because I’m really proud that Hallmark took on a tough subject. But with grace, and the understanding that at that fragile time of life, it’s again about the human touch. And none of us know when we’ll need the services that a Woman and Children’s hospital will provide,” Lawrence said. The Queen and her court also played games and visited with children and their parents. “To be here today really confirms to me what I’ve already known,” the 77th Azalea Queen said. “It was a really moving visit, because, you see the success, you see the fragility, but you know the resilience that’s behind it all.” Copyright 2024 WECT.

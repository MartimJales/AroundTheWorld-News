    "text": "AAA talks Distracted Driving Awareness Month and tips to combat it TWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) —The month of April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month. According AAA, distracted driving kills 10 people and injures a thousand everyday. 17% of the crashes in Idaho last year were due to distracted driving. Distractions can be a cell phone, eating while driving and even grooming oneself. Texting while driving causes your eyes to leave the road for at least 5 seconds. AAA spokesperson Matthew Conde gives tips on how to not get distracted and to keep your focus on driving conditions, “Just to getting that endorphin boost seeing that like or that response to something that we’re doing, so we need to try to control some of that. If it means putting the phone in the glove compartment or having a trusted co-pilot do the navigating, the texting, those kinds of things. That might be a really good idea, and also if you’re going to be making a lot of adjustments to things like seats, and climate controls, or mirrors. Do all those things before the vehicle starts moving.” If you’re using a navigation system, put in your location before you start driving. Check if your phone has driving focus features that help with distractions when driving. Copyright 2024 KMVT. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "The state is helping families remove lead from their homes, free of charge LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - The state’s health department has a message for Mid-Michigan -- anyone living in a home built in the 1970′s needs to get it tested for lead, especially if they have children six and under. The City of Lansing said it’s helping families make sure they are living in lead safe homes. The number one source of lead poisoning in Michigan is lead-based paint in older homes, like the ones built before 1978. “I got my house tested for lead and a lot of lead was found inside of my home.” Shamika Deberry said she didn’t know there was lead in the pipes and paint in her home until her five-year-old daughter tested positive for lead during a routine check-up. Through state programs like, [ Lead Safe Lansing](https://www.lansingmi.gov/346/Lead-Safe-Lansing), Community Development Coordinator, Tyler Blakey said the city is removing lead from homes at no cost to the residents. He said “well this is something that we weren’t aware of whenever these houses were being built and lead-based paint was commonly used everywhere until it was outlawed in 1978. According to Blakey, “Lansing has a lot of older homes.” [70% of lead poisoned children in Ingham County are living in rental housing](https://health.ingham.org/health/maternal_and_child_health/lead_poisoning_prevention_program.php#:~:text=Ingham%20County%20Health%20Department,-Medical%20Health%20Officer&text=70%25%20of%20lead%20poisoned%20children,rental%20inspection%20or%20licensing%20programs.), according to the health department. Blakey said peeling or chalky paint are indicators of lead-based paint. Also in the county, lead clearance is not required as part of a rental inspection or licensing. “For pregnant women, [lead] can cause miscarriages and lower birth weight. And for children, it can cause lower IQ’s, developmental issues, and hearing impairment, speech disorders,” said Blakey. Through its [Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund](https://michigansaves.org/leadfund/), Michigan Saves offers free lead inspections, risk assessment, and a 50/50 cost sharing incentive to remove lead from your home. “Something that could be tough for homeowners to navigate so we’re glad to be here to help them navigate that process,” said Nishaat Killeen, Senior Project Manager at Michigan Saves. The Lead Safe Lansing Program offers grants to help remediate lead-based paint hazards in Lansing homes. This program is available to home owners and rental property owners who meet qualification criteria. Those who qualify can receive up to $16,000 for repairs designed to remediate lead-based paint hazards.

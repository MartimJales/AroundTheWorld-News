    "text": "With the third month of the year already in the rearview mirror for the Inter Miami CF Academy presented by Baptist Health, let's unveil the players that earned Player of the Month honors for March. For our Academy's youngest age groups, it's U-12 player Yohan Calixte who gets the nod as Player of the Month. \"Yohan has shown a high level of performance throughout all trainings and games. He is a player with great responsibility both defensively and offensively. His behavior on and off the field has been exemplary, always showing values of respect, commitment, companionship and personal effort,\" said U-12 Academy team head coach Diego Garcia. \"I believe his individual and collective technique, interpretation of the game in all its phases and over everything his quality of being a team player, are characteristics to highlight.\" Moving onto our Academy's mid-level age brackets, U-14/U-15 player Kai Nesfield earns Player of the Month honors for March. \"Kai had the honor to be called up for the USYNT camp in Atlanta this month along with the top players born in 2010 in the country. He also is currently in Croatia for another national camp with the Croatian national team. Kai has shown incredible commitment on and off the field, performing well playing a year up with the U-15 team, as well as being a top performer when playing with the U-14s. He is a dedicated young man that is always opened to learning and developing,\" expressed U-15 team head coach Pedro Cavalcanti. Lastly, U-17/U-19 attacker Daniel Pinter is named Player of the Month for our Academy's eldest teams. \"Daniel's performances for our U-17 and U-19 teams earned him the opportunity to make his professional debut with Inter Miami II against the New York Red Bulls on March 24. We are proud to have seen him make his debut and have an impact on the game by scoring a late equalizer for the team,\" highlighted U-19 team head coach Giuseppe DePalo.

    "text": "(InvestigateTV) — Bankrate has reported that the national average interest rate for a savings account is .59% with rates varying from .01% to 5.27% among banks.\nMichael Joyce with the financial firm Agili urged consumers to check their interest rate.\n“Because a lot of banks are still paying somewhere in the range of .05% which does round to zero,” Joyce explained. “But you can get higher rates, maybe even at the bank where you have your money, your savings account.”\nJoyce recommended consumers to research money market accounts and ask about short-term CDs and treasury bills, which may offer an even higher rate of return.\nHe said credit unions are also an option and may offer a higher rate. He also suggested people consider online banks, which offer great rates of return, that are FDIC insured.\n“Bank failures are still low from a historical standpoint but it’s important to have your funds insured because if the bank does fail you want to have access to your funds,” Joyce pointed out. “You don’t want to lose those funds.”\nJoyce said interest rates won’t stay high forever, which is why it’s great to take advantage of them now.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. 12-year-old leads police on chase after taking her mother’s car without permission ",

    "text": "(CHICAGO)– April 4, 2024 – CommonSpirit Health, one of the nation's largest nonprofit health systems, is excited to announce its plans to grow its internal Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) – Edgewise. Edgewise is CommonSpirit Health’s in-house GPO and also provides GPO services to member organizations outside CommonSpirit. By growing Edgewise’s reach and scope, CommonSpirit will be able to serve the diverse needs and provide even greater value to its members.\n“Engaging directly with the vendor community, Edgewise has already brought significant savings and benefits to its members,” said Kristy Waters, CommonSpirit Health’s Senior Vice President of Support Services and Resource Management. “By expanding Edgewise’s reach, we can provide even greater savings to our members and pivot our relationships with our partners from transactional to strategic.”\nCommonSpirit is also releasing a Request For Proposal for a support Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). While a third-party GPO will continue to play a role in CommonSpirit’s procurement strategy, the scope of this partnership will be redefined to meet CommonSpirit’s changing needs.",

    "text": "Tayla Vlaeminck took 3-12 as touring Australia defeated Bangladesh in the third T20 international.\nTayla Vlaeminck has boosted her injury comeback as Australia’s women’s cricket team wrapped up a triumphant tour of Bangaldesh with a 77-run victory in the third T20 international.\nPace bowler Vlaeminck took 3-12 from her four overs as Bangladesh were dismissed for 78 after Australia’s had posted 6-155 from their 20 overs at Sher-e-Bangla Stadium on Thursday.\nThe win ensured Australia completed a clean sweep of the three ODIs and three T20s on their tour.\nIt was just 25-year-old Vlaeminck’s second match back after two years out of the team due to a recurrent foot stress fracture then shoulder surgery.\nRegarded as possibly the best quick in Australia since she was 18, she has been dogged by injury since her Australian debut in 2018, playing just 29 games across all formats.\nVlaeminck’s horror run has included three separate ACL ruptures by age 20, as well as a shoulder dislocation as a teenager.\nSkipper Alyssa Healy put Australia on track for victory early in the tour finale with 45 runs from 29 balls as opener while Tahlia McGrath scored an unbeaten 44 from 29 balls batting at No.5.\nGeorgia Wareham was the other multiple wicket taker for the tourists with figures of 2-1 off 1.1 overs.",

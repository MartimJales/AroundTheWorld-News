    "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. - A senior at Centenary College isn’t letting a rare bleeding disorder stop him from leading a fulfilling life. Instead it’s guiding his path and inspiring him to help others. Aiden Peterkin was diagnosed with hemophilia A at just three days old. It's a rare disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. It can cause uncontrolled internal bleeding. It’s stopped him from doing some things. “I couldn’t do contact sports like football or soccer. Eventually when I got old enough in middle school it started to get a little too rough,” said Peterkin. But it’s helped him find new passions. “I personally had to change some of my goals, like I thought I would be a star soccer player, but obviously that didn't happen, so I'm a swimmer,” said Peterkin. He’s been on Centenary’s swim team for the past four years, qualifying for the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference Academic All-District Team 2023 and earning the SCAC Sportsmanship Award 2023. “Just set your sights on a goal and achieve it,” said Peterkin. Now as he prepares to graduate from Centenary, his diagnosis has also shaped his plans for the future. He's been accepted to LSU Health Shreveport School of Medicine. “I got to see firsthand the physician's impact on their patients and the community that they're part of. I knew that's exactly what I wanted to do,” said Peterkin. He still isn’t sure exactly what he wants to do in the medical field, but knows he wants to make a difference and show others living with medical conditions that anything is possible. “I just want to give back to my community and do something that I love,” said Peterkin. Aiden is set to graduate this spring.",

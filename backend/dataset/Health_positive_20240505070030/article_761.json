    "text": "Purdue University Fort Wayne student Nicole Pitcher could only guess Thursday how many ceramic bowls she contributed to an annual fundraiser benefiting the campus food pantry.\n\"I think I made 25 bowls,\" Pitcher said as people browsed the handcrafted items during the Empty Bowls event at Walb Student Union.\nHer uncertainty was understandable. She and her advanced ceramics classmates described themselves as \"production potters\" as they prepared for the fundraiser, which provided a soup lunch and one-of-a-kind bowl for a $30 donation.\nThe final inventory totaled about 250 bowls, including some from area high schools, said Seth Green, associate professor of ceramics.\nA video showcasing the bowl-making process played on repeat, highlighting such steps as throwing and shaping clay on pottery wheels and dipping the dishes in glaze.\n\"The making of the bowls takes all semester,\" Green said.\nThat wasn't his students' only responsibility for the seventh annual event. His advanced ceramics class, which typically has about 12 to 15 students per semester, also wrote grants to pay for the materials, handled the marketing and sought donations for the lunch, which also included bread, cookies and bottled water.\n\"The students plan everything,\" Green said.\nHe described Empty Bowls as a service-learning project that teaches students how to plan, prepare and run a big event with community partners â€“ something they will likely encounter after graduation.\n\"It's an effort that takes a lot of people,\" Green said, noting former students were also invited to bowl-making opportunities.\nProceeds will benefit the university's Ceramics Club and the Friends of the University Pantry at Purdue Fort Wayne, which last year provided frozen, packaged and canned food to nearly 9,000 people.\nThe pantry's website,\nwww.pfw.edu/the-pantry, indicates it accepts donations of nonperishable food including pasta, peanut butter and granola bars along with such personal care items as shampoo, soap and toothpaste.\nIt is open to everyone from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursdays in Room G36 of Walb Union. Student-only hours are 4 to 7 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays at the student housing clubhouse, according to its website.\nEmpty Bowls last year raised $7,184 last year, according to the university.\nPitcher didn't risk waiting until the end of the four-hour event to purchase one of Green's bowls, which played with texture.\n\"I made sure to get a bowl while I could,\" she said.",

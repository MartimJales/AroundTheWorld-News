    "text": "NURTEC ODT is Now Available in Canada for the Treatment of Acute Migraine Published: Apr 04, 2024\n More than one billion people worldwide live with migraine, i and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as the second leading cause of disability in the world. ii\nKIRKLAND, QC , April 4, 2024 /CNW/ - NURTEC ODT ® (rimegepant) is now available in Canada for use in the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura in adults older than 18 years of age. iii NURTEC is an orally disintegrating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist tablet. It was approved by Health Canada on December 1, 2023 .\nClassified as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses in the world, iv migraine is a brain disease characterized by attacks that last from four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms including, pulsating moderate to severe headache, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and sometimes vomiting, as well as cognitive fogginess, amongst other symptoms. v\n\"Migraine is a common, disabling brain disease, and for those living with migraine, effective therapy can take years to be found,\" said Dr. Christine Lay , Professor of Neurology and Founding Director of the Headache Program at the University of Toronto. \"It is an exciting time for Canadians to now have another targeted, migraine specific therapy in their management toolbox.\"\nAn estimated 4.5 million Canadians suffer from migraine with one in four households having someone affected by the disease. vi In Canada, migraine is a leading cause of years lived with disability among those aged 15 to 49 years. vii\n\"Migraine symptoms are complex and may last for several days. People living with migraine are looking for timely and equitable access to new options to effectively manage this highly debilitating disease,\" said Wendy Gerhart from Migraine Canada. \"We are excited for new treatments to help advance migraine care, which is often overlooked, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.\"\n\"Pfizer Canada is proud to bring this new therapy to Canadians impacted by migraine,\" said Andréa Mueller, Primary Care Portfolio Lead, Pfizer Canada. \"Pfizer has a long-standing legacy in managing neurological conditions, and we are proud to build on our commitment in this area with our work in the treatment of migraine.\"\nAbout Migraine Migraine is the third most prevalent illness in the world, viii affecting around 1.3 billion people globally. ix Migraine prevalence is highest during peak employment years. x In Canada, migraine is the third-leading cost driver for incremental productivity loss due to absenteeism and presenteeism. xi,xii While migraine affects all demographics, women are disproportionately impacted by this brain disease. xiii\nAbout NURTEC ODT ® NURTEC ODT targets a key component of migraine by reversibly blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors. CGRP is increased during a migraine attack, promotes neurogenic inflammation, dilates blood vessels and is involved in nociceptor signaling. CGRP receptor antagonists work by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the endogenous CGRP neuropeptide. CGRP receptors are a key contributor to the trigeminal nerve pain and inflammation of migraine. xiv\nAbout Pfizer Canada Pfizer Canada ULC is the Canadian operation of Pfizer Inc., one of the world's leading biopharmaceutical companies.

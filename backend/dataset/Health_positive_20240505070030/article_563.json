    "text": "Lee Health is driven by our mission to be a trusted partner, empowering healthier lives through care and compassion, and we have been for more than 107 years. Our mission extends to every person in our community. To ensure we respond appropriately to our community’s needs, we use the Community Health Needs Assessment as our guide to identify areas where we can join our local partners to affect the overall health of Southwest Florida.\nEach year, we invest significant time, talent and resources for community benefit. To qualify as a community benefit, programs or activities must provide treatment and/or promote health and healing as a response to identified community needs and must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n• They must improve access to healthcare services.\n• They must enhance the health of the community.\n• They must advance medical or health knowledge.\n• They must relieve or reduce the burden of government or other community efforts.\nIn 2023, the net value of our community benefit was $178,795,934. You can check out the 2023 Community Benefit Report (and past years’ reports, too) by visiting\nwww.LeeHealth.org and searching for ‘Community Benefit’ in the search bar. When you do, you will learn more about the ways we supported our community through child advocacy, injury prevention, sports safety, health professional education and support, our residency programs, Lee Community Healthcare and more. Throughout the report, you will see our efforts focused on enabling access to the highest quality, compassionate care and finding ways to inspire healthier habits and behaviors.\nThe people of Southwest Florida have our unwavering commitment and our undivided attention. The Community Benefit Report helps illustrate that dedication. I hope you take the time to read the full report and feel confident of all the ways our health system serves, cares for and impacts the health and well-being of our community. ¦",

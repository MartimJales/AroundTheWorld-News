The Sioux Falls-based project will affect several health services, but one key area of growth will be the expansion of care for children across the Avera footprint. It’s been a long time coming. Over the past few years, Avera pediatric specialties has been able to grow staff and build up to announcing an exciting new hospital expansion to serve a growing community. “We've got this great team, now we just need the building, the great building or the great place for the great team to move into because we already have these really wonderful services and sub-specialists built out and we haven't had a chance to show it off. I feel like people now will start to associate the building with the quality care they're getting for kids,” said Katherine Wang, MD, Neonatology. The Avera McKennan NICU will see an expansion of more beds and additional services for the sickest and smallest patients. “Being a NICU doctor, the ones that start with us, we always love to see them grow, and we ask how do we help keep them flourishing and keep them in our community, so that we can see them grow and help that family do that,\" said Dr. Wang. “Pediatrics is expanding. So we're now up to 10 pediatricians just here in Sioux Falls. That doesn't include all the regions, but Pediatrics is expanding everywhere. We have increased sub-specialists to help everyone take care of your child, whether it's in the clinic, in the hospital, wherever you are,” said Kara Bruning, MD, Pediatrics. The emphasis on growth has led to additions of pediatric specialists to support children from the NICU throughout their teen years. The ability to leverage technology within those specialties allows patients to get their care closer to home. “You don't have to leave. We can take care of complex problems. And if your child is facing something like that, you want to be at home. You don't want to be elsewhere. In addition to that, we are expanding our telemedicine services. So if you don't live here in Sioux Falls, you can still reach that subspecialist out in the regions, which is huge for our families as well,” said Dr. Bruning. If a hospital stay is necessary, this team understands how important a welcoming and calming environment is for children. That’s why this unit will be designed with their needs in mind. “The great thing about having a pediatric hospital is that you can design it around a child. A child's needs are different than that of an adult. They're not little adults, right? They have their own needs and own wants,” said Dr. Bruning. “When they walk in, it will be obvious this is a place for them. And for women too, I would hope that they would have that same experience. They walk in, and say ‘This is a place where I'm going to feel comfortable and they're going to take care of me,’” said Dr. Wang. The project will take some time to complete, but this team is ready to see years of careful development grow into something extraordinary. “I'm so excited for this to come out. We've been trying to work on this for years!” said Dr. Bruning. “We have all these services here that people are always pleasantly surprised to find out about, but I don't want them to be surprised anymore. I want them to know it's here and we're ready to go. We're ready to serve you. We're ready to meet the needs of your kids wherever they are,” said Dr. Wang. Construction will begin later this summer and is expected to be completed in early 2027.

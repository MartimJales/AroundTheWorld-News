    "text": "In today’s fast-paced world, multitasking is essential. What if we told you that your Mac can read text out loud, freeing up your hands and eyes for other tasks? In this article, we will guide you through the process in seven easy steps.\nStep 1: Open System Preferences\nTo start off, click on the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen and select “System Preferences.”\nStep 2: Access Accessibility Settings\nOnce the System Preferences panel is open, locate and click on the “Accessibility” icon.\nStep 3: Navigate to the Speech Settings\nInside the Accessibility panel, you will find several options on the left-hand side. Find and click on “Speech” (or “Spoken Content” in macOS Catalina and later) to access the settings for text-to-speech.\nStep 4: Choose a Voice and Adjust Settings\nNow that you have opened the Speech settings, choose a system voice from the provided options. Macs typically come with several voice options corresponding to different accents and languages. You can also adjust the speaking rate by modifying the slider. This helps you find a pace that works best for you.\nStep 5: Select Text to Be Read\nOnce you have customized your preferences, find the text or document that you would like your Mac to read. Highlight this text by clicking and dragging with your mouse or trackpad.\nStep 6: Trigger Text-to-Speech\nWith your desired text highlighted, right-click (or control-click) on it to bring up a context menu. Scroll down to find the “Speech” option (or “Services” > “Speech” in some cases) and then click on “Start Speaking.” Your Mac will now begin reading the selected text using your chosen voice and speed.\nStep 7: Pause or Stop Reading\nIf at any moment you need to pause or stop the reading, you can right-click (or control-click) on the text again, navigate to “Speech” in the context menu, and click on “Stop Speaking.” Note that this option will only be available while your Mac is actively reading text.\nAnd there you have it – 7 simple steps to make your Mac read any text to you. With this handy feature, you can listen to articles, emails, or even have a much-needed break from attaching your eyes to a screen. Happy listening!",

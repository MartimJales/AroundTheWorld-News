    "text": "Agency The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved an end-of-year bonus for workers of the Lagos Waste Management Authority. The Managing Director/CEO of LAWMA, Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, who disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Lagos, said the bonus which caused great jubilation among the sanitation workers was the governor’s appreciation of their crucial role of keeping the state clean as well as his commitment to their welfare. LAWMA is an agency of the state responsible for the collection and disposal of municipal and industrial waste, as well as for the provision of commercial waste services to the state and local governments. Gbadegesin said that the hard-working heroes and heroines of the agency who could not hide their joy lauded the gesture by the governor. “Gov. Sanwo-Olu acknowledges the tireless efforts of our street sweepers and waste handlers in maintaining a clean and healthy environment for Lagosians. “This bonus is a gesture of gratitude for their dedication and commitment, especially during this festive season,” he said. The governor had in February 2023 increased the salaries of the sanitation workers in the state by 20 percent. Sanwo-Olu said the sanitation workers will also be provided with new work tools such as overalls, boots, and personal protective equipment to help them carry out their tasks successfully. He assured that the present administration in the state will provide necessary support for the workers to carry out their roles efficiently. Gbadegesin said that the bonus would impact the lives of the recipients and their families, bringing joy and relief during the season. He said that the news was met with jubilation among sanitation workers, as they expressed appreciation for the governor’s gesture. The LAWMA boss, who wished residents a Happy New Year celebration, assured that the Authority would continue to consolidate its efforts to make all parts of the state clean in 2024. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Sanwo-Olu also approved an end-of-the-year bonus for all public servants in the state for their contributions to the advancement of the state. (NAN)",

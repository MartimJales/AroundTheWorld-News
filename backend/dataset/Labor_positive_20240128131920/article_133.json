    "text": "Sentiment on the German labour market improved slightly at the end of 2023 for the first time in almost a year. The labour market barometer of the Nuremberg Institute for Employment Research (IAB) rose by 2023.0 points to 4.99 points in December 9. The leading indicator for the development of the German labour market is thus only slightly below the value of 100 defined as neutral. \"The employment agencies do not foresee an easy year, especially for unemployment, but the decline in expectations did not continue at the turn of the year,\" IAB expert Enzo Weber said on Friday. The labour market is no longer the self-runner it was in recent years, but it can still be relied on even in the economic downturn, Weber added. The situation on the European labour market has also improved, according to the IAB data. In December 2023, the European Labour Market Barometer rose for the first time in seven months: by 0.2 points to 99.2 points. \"The European labour market services are still rather pessimistic about the coming months, but there is hope that the bottom has been passed,\" summarised labour market expert Weber. The labour market barometers are based on monthly surveys of the German employment agencies and the employment services in the European countries. A value of 100 is considered a neutral outlook, while a value below 100 indicates a negative development. mik/dpa-AFX",

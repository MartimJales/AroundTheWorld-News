    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. , Dec. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Meijer announced today it received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2023-2024 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Also called the CEI Equality 100 Award, this is the retailer's fourth consecutive year receiving the highest score.\nIn its continued effort to make all people feel welcomed, supported, valued and meaningfully engaged, Meijer has grown its team member resource group (TMRG) program by 300 percent in the past year. Those groups include Meijer Pride, Meijer Disability Awareness and Advocacy Group (mDAAG), Women at Meijer, YoPro (young professionals), mVets (veterans), and MOSAIC (diverse backgrounds including cultural and faith traditions).\n\"This achievement recognizes our ongoing commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion both at Meijer and in the communities we serve,\" said Terry Ledbetter , Chief Information Officer at Meijer and Executive Sponsor for the company's Meijer Pride TMRG. \"Benchmarking year after year helps ensure access to benefits, policies, resources, and relationships critical for our team members so they too can bring their best selves to work every day.\"\nThe CEI rates companies on detailed criteria falling under four central pillars:\nNon-discrimination policies across business entities Equitable benefits for LGBTQ+ workers and their families Supporting an inclusive culture Corporate social responsibility \"For well over two decades, businesses have played an important role in furthering LGBTQ+ equality by centering employee needs and voices when it comes to workplace inclusion. While there is much more work to be done, year-over-year growth in CEI participation is evidence of a business community that recognizes the responsibility and value in upholding equity and inclusion,\" said RaShawn Hawkins , Human Rights Campaign Senior Director of Workplace Equality. \"Our goal at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation is to work in a spirit of partnership with companies, providing educational resources and leading benchmarking, and collaborating on ways for businesses to support the LGBTQ+ community at a time when we face unprecedented legislative attacks, heightened anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and physical violence. The CEI is an ever-evolving tool â€“ a blueprint that companies can use to show up more effectively in supporting their LGBTQ+ employees and their families.\"\nThe results of the 2023-2024 CEI showcase how U.S.-based companies are promoting LGBTQ+ friendly workplace policies nationwide and abroad. The first year of the CEI included 319 participants, and the 2023-2024 CEI now includes 1,384 participants; further demonstrating the tremendous trajectory of the CEI, a record-breaking 1,340 businesses have non-discrimination protections specific to gender identity, up from just 17 in 2002. These critical non-discrimination protections cover 21 million employees in the U.S. and around the globe.\nThe full report is available online at http://www.hrc.org/cei .

    "text": "Qualtrics, Dow succeed in CX digital transformation venture UTAH & WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES — Software provider Qualtrics has successfully [launched](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/qualtrics-insights-help-dow-unlock-300-million-in-value-through-digital-and-cx-transformation/) a digital transformation that raised the [customer experience (CX)](https://www.outsourceaccelerator.com/articles/customer-experience-optimization/?utm_source=%28referral%29&utm_medium=news+article&utm_campaign=NPR+Referral) for the materials science firm Dow. Dow used several of Qualtrics’ advanced tools, such as the Qualtrics Digital CX and the Qualtrics XM Institute CX Maturity assessment, to identify and understand the unique needs of its customers. They then compared these insights with various operational and financial metrics and used them to iron out key operational functions in shipment visibility and tracking, supply, order upgrade placements, and demand and inventory management. Dow combined these insights with its visualization and predictive modeling platforms, which enabled their customers to craft efficient production chains. According to the two firms, their partnership resulted in a 450% increase in repeat visitors to Dow’s digital commerce platform, an increase in new leads generated via digital engagement from 5% to 65%, and an over 200% increase in digital orders. All in all, it generated $300 million in value. Riccardo Porta, the global director for CX at Dow said: “From the early days of our journey, Qualtrics solutions have allowed us to rationalize and monetize our CX disciplines to unlock new value for our customers and for Dow.” Sachin Goregaoker, Chief Product Officer of Qualtrics XM for Digital Frontlines, expressed pride in helping Dow realize its goal with a data-led enterprise-wide CX strategy: “In the experience economy, the brands that win and continue to stay at the forefront are those that listen to their customers and improve processes across every critical interaction.”",

    "text": "视频播放位置\n下载安装Flash播放器 OSLO, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian government will do its best to create more job opportunities and increase the pace of climate action, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in his New Year Speech on Monday.\nIn the nationally broadcast speech, Store reflected on the challenges of the past year, noting that global conflicts, economic instability, pandemic aftermath and rising prices strained both national and household budgets.\nAcknowledging the financial hardships many are facing, Store expressed optimism about the turning point in Norway's economy. He highlighted the government's efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates, foreseeing a stable economic recovery for the country, its businesses and individuals in 2024.\nFocusing on employment, the prime minister announced plans to convert part-time jobs into full-time roles and create more jobs, especially for the young. Emphasizing the value of young workers in an aging population, he said it is important to treat them well.\nStore also addressed the younger generation's concerns regarding climate change, biodiversity loss, oceanic plastic pollution and urban air quality. He committed to more significant actions in these areas, emphasizing that climate action must now surpass the pace of climate change.\nHe highlighted some ongoing green initiatives, including the replacement of old ferries and buses with electric ones, as well as the energy-saving measures adopted by Norwegian households.

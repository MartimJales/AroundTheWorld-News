    "text": "Simply Wall St. PZ Cussons plc's (LON:PZC) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 26% Above Its Share Price Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) December 29, 2023 at 10:24 AM · 6 min read Key Insights\nPZ Cussons' estimated fair value is UK£1.92 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nPZ Cussons' UK£1.52 share price signals that it might be 21% undervalued\nThe UK£2.03 analyst price target for PZC is 5.7% more than our estimate of fair value\nHow far off is PZ Cussons plc (LON:PZC) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\nSee our latest analysis for PZ Cussons\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation? We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate 2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\nLevered FCF (£, Millions)\nUK£43.7m\nUK£52.7m\nUK£57.2m\nUK£60.4m\nUK£63.1m\nUK£65.4m\nUK£67.3m\nUK£69.0m\nUK£70.5m\nUK£72.0m\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 5.72%\nEst @ 4.46%\nEst @ 3.58%\nEst @ 2.96%\nEst @ 2.53%\nEst @ 2.23%\nEst @ 2.01%\nPresent Value (£, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9%\nUK£40.1\nUK£44.4\nUK£44.2\nUK£42.9\nUK£41.1\nUK£39.1\nUK£36.9\nUK£34.8\nUK£32.6\nUK£30.5\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK£387m\nStory continues We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = UK£72m× (1 + 1.5%) ÷ (8.9%– 1.5%) = UK£984m\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = UK£984m÷ ( 1 + 8.9%) 10 = UK£418m\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is UK£804m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of UK£1.5, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nLSE:PZC Discounted Cash Flow December 29th 2023 The Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PZ Cussons as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.257. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nSWOT Analysis for PZ Cussons Strength\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Personal Products market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the British market.\nLooking Ahead: Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

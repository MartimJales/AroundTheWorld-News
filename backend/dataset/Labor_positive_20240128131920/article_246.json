    "text": "OFW deployment up 18 percent The deployment of overseas Filipino workers from January to early December reached an all-time high of 2.4 million, according to the Department of Migrant Workers. The figure represents an 18 percent increase from 2022 deployment data. DMW Officer-in-Charge Hans Leo Cacdac said about 608,000 sea-based workers were deployed compared to last year’s 554,000, while 491,000 land-based workers were deployed compared to last year’s 411,820. “The number of seafarers rose initially, reaching 608,000 compared to 554,000 overseas certificates distributed for the sea-based workers. For land-based workers, the figures increased to 491,000 from 411,820,” Cacdac said. “The increase to 608,000 is particularly noteworthy, as it marks the first time we’ve issued such a high number for the sea-based sector. It’s evident that 2023 was the year when global economies began to open up, along with world trade, marking our transition into a post-pandemic era,” he added. The shift, the DMW official said, signifies the opening of economies, job markets, and global trade, with seafarers playing a pivotal role. The DMW said it is anticipating an improved economic climate for 2024, with more job opportunities for Filipinos. “We are anticipating an improved economic climate for 2024. This year, our expectations are higher for openings, especially as we focus on Saudi Arabia, where major development projects align with their vision for 2030,” Cacdac said. DMW Undersecretary for Policy and International Cooperation Patricia Yvonne Caunan said that the department has pending bilateral labor agreements with 25 countries. “Currently, within the department, we have 38 pending bilateral labor agreements and memoranda of understanding with 25 countries in our pipeline. Of these, 18 are from Europe and the Americas, 16 from the Middle East and Africa, and four from Asia and the Pacific,” Caunan said. She added that the department successfully established the Japan Desk to safeguard the welfare of the OFWs in that country. “The purpose behind this desk is not only to continuously safeguard the welfare of OFWs in Japan but also to ensure, in their own words, that we regain our position as the number one choice in Japan,” the DMW official said.

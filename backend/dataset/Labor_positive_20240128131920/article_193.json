The number of jobless workers stood at 8.2 million.\nBrazil’s economy proved resilient to double-digit borrowing costs during much of the year, with unemployment falling to levels not seen since 2015. Analysts and policymakers point to reforms such as a labor overhaul in 2017 to explain the country’s ability to grow without stoking inflation. Central bankers led by Roberto Campos Neto are cutting now rates as prices edge toward target.\nAfter kicking off one of the first easing cycles in the region in August, policymakers have since reduced rates by two percentage points, to 11.75%. They’ve also signaled two more half-percentage point drops through March.\nRead more: Brazil Annual Inflation Tops All Estimates in Early December\n--With assistance from Giovanna Serafim.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk Made 2023 All About Himself\nWhat Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging Products\nWhat the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying Young\nSurviving the Markets, the Kitchen and War on The Businessweek Show\nHow the Elf on the Shelf Took Over Christmas\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.\nView comments",

    "text": "LOS BANOS, Calif — Elizabeth Ruiz followed in her parent's footsteps to join the work in the fields of Merced County’s westside during the pandemic when no other work options were available. Her story echoes that of many in the area who, unable to find a job in town, turned to the fields for a paycheck. She, alongside her mother and father, know no other way of life, she said. Ruiz, along with hundreds of other farm workers from the area, waited in a line braving the cold outside the Mercy Springs Church of the Nazarene on Dec. 14 at a [Cultiva La Salud](http://cultivalasalud.org/) (CLS) event aimed at putting some money in their pockets. In an area set up in the back of the church, about a dozen volunteers sat with each worker individually for about seven minutes, explaining the intricacies of applying for The Farm and Food Worker Relief Grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The [grant](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/ffwr) provides a one-time $600 payment for those who worked to feed American families during the pandemic. “Farmworkers didn't have the opportunity to stop working during the pandemic,” said CLS Program Director Claudia Gabriela Cochardo. “They had to continue feeding us without sick pay and vacation time.” Part of a $670 million program funded through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the grant has the purpose “to defray worker expenses incurred preparing for, preventing exposure to, and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to USDA documents. Ruiz flashed back to her time in the field and the challenges a worldwide health crisis brought to an already backbreaking job. “It was difficult because we had to wear the masks and sometimes bandanas over our faces,” she said, recalling picking cantaloupes while a machine would drive by and spray her with dry dirt. “I know fieldwork is super hard, and it’s really sad to see the older people working there for minimum wage.” The money, Ruiz said, would help her family greatly since her parents are out of work, and it’s up to her and her sister to care for their family. “It’ll help bring food to the table during the holidays,” she said. “Something extra is a big help for everyone.” Further up the line, a group of four young laborers awaited their turn. One of them, Javier Romero, said he’s been working the fields all his life. “Me meti al campo para ayudar a mi familia — I went to work in the field to help my family,” he said in Spanish. The group of friends, all originally from the Mexican state of Sinaloa, heard of the event through word of mouth. They endured the cold, hoping to receive some funds since work in the field had slowed down for the year. “The money is going to help a lot, especially now that work is dead,” Romero said. “We probably won’t have steady work until January.” With the end of the picking season, Romero said he would travel to various towns to try to get pruning work.",

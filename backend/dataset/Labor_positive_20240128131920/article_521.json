    "text": "MDJ Script/ Top Stories for Dec 30th\nPublish Date: Dec 29th\nCommercial: Henssler :15\nFrom the Henssler Financial Studio, Welcome to the Marietta Daily Journal Podcast.\nToday is Saturday, December 30th and Happy 87th Birthday to HOF pitcher Sandy Koufax.\n***12.30.23 - BIRTHDAY - SANDY KOUFAX***\nI’m Keith Ippolito and here are the stories Cobb is talking about, presented by Credit Union of Georgia.\nAll of this and more is coming up on the Marietta Daily Journal Podcast, and if you are looking for community news, we encourage you to listen and subscribe!\nBREAK: CU of GA\nSTORY 1: Cobb Unemployment Drops Below 3%\nIn November, Cobb County's unemployment rate dropped to 2.8%, down from 3.1% in October but higher than 2.4% in November 2022. The county's labor force increased by 295, with 431,345 employed and 12,226 unemployed. The rise in unemployment is attributed to individuals re-entering the workforce post-COVID-19. Economist Roger Tutterow notes that the increased unemployment rate isn't concerning if job cuts aren't occurring, highlighting a significant increase in employed workers. Marietta's November unemployment rate was 2.7%, while Smyrna's remained at 3.2%. Cobb County's unemployment rate is lower than Atlanta's (3.1%) and Georgia's (3.4%), both below the national rate of 3.7%.\nSTORY 2: Kennesaw Council Newcomer Ready to Take on Wildman's Civil War Surplus\nMadelyn Orochena, newly elected to Kennesaw City Council, aims to close Wildman’s Civil War Surplus, a Confederate-themed store in the city's downtown. Orochena, who views the store as a hindrance to progress, plans to pursue legal action or code enforcement to shut it down. While previous blight complaints were dismissed, Orochena, an arts enthusiast, hopes to transform the downtown into a vibrant destination with a diverse range of shops. She initiated a mural installation near Wildman's, emphasizing her commitment to public art. Orochena also advocates for pedestrian safety, affordable housing, and the city's overall growth and improvement.\nSTORY 3: Cobb Civil War Round Table Examines Gen. Joseph E. Johnston\nHistorian Richard McMurry discussed Gen. Joseph E. Johnston at a meeting of the Civil War Round Table of Cobb County. McMurry's latest book, \"The Civil Wars of General Joseph E. Johnston,\" provides a critical analysis of Johnston's campaigns during the Civil War. Johnston, once considered a premier Confederate general, faced challenges defending Atlanta against Gen. William T. Sherman. McMurry's research debunked long-held myths about Johnston, revealing his strategic shortcomings and conflicts with fellow officers. The discussion delved into Johnston's Atlanta campaign, which ultimately resulted in Atlanta's fall to the Union Army led by Sherman.\nWe have opportunities for sponsors to get great engagement on these shows.

The Democratic majority, leveraging Georgia's home rule powers, replaced the state-approved commission district map with its own, challenging the legality of the move. Republican Commissioners JoAnn Birrell and Keli Gambrill abstained from voting, leading to their removal from the dais. The dispute centers on whether Georgia counties can independently draw district maps. A lawsuit, initiated by Gambrill and continued by Cobb residents Catherine and David Floam, challenges the county's map, seeking a declaration of its unconstitutionality and validation of the legislature's map. The court is expected to issue a ruling soon.\nSTORY 5: No. 3: Cobb School Board Map Thrown into Question by Lawsuit\nThe third-ranked local story of 2023 in Cobb County involves a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Cobb Board of Education's districts. The lawsuit alleged an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, leading to a federal judge's order for the General Assembly to draw new districts by January 10. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, preventing future elections using the current school board map. The school district, which spent over $1.3 million defending the map, appealed the injunction to the 11th Circuit of Appeals. The contentious issue revolves around accusations of packing and bleaching voters based on race, with the school board's Republican majority drawing the map after the 2020 census.\nWe’ll be back in a moment\nBreak: DRAKE – INGLES 6\nSTORY 6: Judge upholds new Georgia congressional, legislative maps\nU.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled that federal judges lack the authority to redistribute political power between parties, upholding Georgia's new legislative and congressional maps. The maps were redrawn during a special session following lawsuits alleging Voting Rights Act violations. Jones ordered additional Black-majority districts, aiming for Democratic gains. Despite legislative leaders crafting maps to maintain Republican advantages, Jones ruled that partisan decisions alone don't violate the Voting Rights Act. He upheld the new maps, including the elimination of a coalition district, deeming it moot. Rep. Lucy McBath plans to run in the new Black-majority district, emphasizing the importance of voters' will.\nSTORY 7: No. 4: Books, Bans and 'Good and Evil'\nThe culture wars hit Cobb and Marietta school districts as book bans ignited tensions. Cobb Schools Superintendent Chris Ragsdale fired teacher Katie Rinderle for reading \"My Color is Purple\" to students. Despite protests, the Cobb Board of Education upheld Rinderle's termination, prompting an appeal to the Georgia Board of Education. In August, Ragsdale removed \"Flamer\" and \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" for \"sexually explicit content.\" Marietta Superintendent Grant Rivera followed suit, sparking protests. Both superintendents faced criticism and support for their decisions amid a broader debate on book censorship and education.\nBreak: Henssler :60\nSignoff-\nThanks again for hanging out with us on today’s Marietta Daily Journal podcast.

    "text": "N ew minimum wage increases took effect on Monday in 22 states, boosting wages for an estimated 10 million workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nThe pay increases have also been adopted by 43 cities and localities and are slated to increase employee wages by a combined $7 billion per year, according to estimates from the EPI and other groups.\nNEWSOM EXTENDS FREE HEALTHCARE TO 700,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DESPITE RECORD BUDGET DEFICIT\nAt least three of the states — New York, California, and Washington — increased their pay floor to at least $16 per hour. Meanwhile, more than 45 states and jurisdictions increased their minimum wage to at least $15 per hour, according to the National Employment Law Project, amounting to the biggest victory for low-wage workers in decades.\nWhich states are affected?\nThe 22 states that increased their minimum wage effective Jan. 1 are California, which increased hourly pay to $16 per hour; Washington state, to $16.28; Alaska, to $11.73; Hawaii, to $14; Montana, to $10.30; Arizona, to $14.35; Colorado, to $14.42; South Dakota, to $11.20; Nebraska, to $12; Minnesota, to $10.85; Missouri, to $12.30; Michigan, to $10.33; Illinois, to $14; Ohio, to $10.45; New York, to $15; New Jersey, to $15.13; Vermont, to $13.67; Maine, to $14.15; Connecticut, to $15.69; Rhode Island, to $14; Delaware, to $13.45; and Maryland, to $15.\nWhy the increase?\nThe changes come as employees nationwide have struggled to adjust to higher costs due to inflation, which cooled slightly in the latter half of 2023 after rising to a 40-year high in 2022. Consumer prices have also steadily increased since 2020.\nMeanwhile, the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009, prompting new affordability complaints from millions of workers.\nProponents of a higher minimum wage have argued the federal minimum wage is far below the required amount for employees to meet the \"self-sufficiency standard,\" or the estimated income required for a family to meet its basic needs. More than 20 states continue to abide by the federal minimum wage.\nStill, the 2024 increases are a major victory for low-wage workers.\nThey also help address inflation and rising consumer costs: Of the 22 states that boosted their minimum wage on Jan. 1, 12 states approved plans that will automatically adjust worker pay for inflation each year.\nWho's affected?\nThe minimum wage increases are slated to disproportionately benefit women, who make up more than 57% of employees receiving an increase in pay, as well as black workers, who make up 9% of the wage-earning workforce, and Hispanic workers, who make up 19% of the affected employees, according to a blog post from the EPI late last month.\nAlmost 1 in 5 workers who will receive a pay boost have incomes below the poverty level, while roughly half of workers, 47%, have incomes below twice the poverty line. More than 25% of workers affected are parents.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nDespite the progress, however, advocates are pushing for more to be done.\n\"Despite continued progress by many states across the country to increase their wage floors, there are still 17.6 million workers earning less than $15 an hour,\" an assistant EPI researcher, Sebastian Martinez Hickey, said in the blog post.\nLatest What to know about the new IRS tax brackets for 2024 — and who stands to gain By: Breanne Deppisch\nNew Democratic mayor of Akron, Ohio, announces DEI and climate change team in first moves By: Christian Datoc\nDemocrats upset with Biden administration for bypassing Congress on Israel weapons — again By: Breanne Deppisch\nVideos\nTwelve days of WEX-mas: Economy — is 2024 going to be the year of the recession?\nReporter's Notebook: Biden administration's plans for 2024\nReporter's Notebook: Harvard University controversy on antisemitism and President Claudine Gay plagiarism allegations\nDearly departed: The presidential candidates who have suspended their 2024 campaigns Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

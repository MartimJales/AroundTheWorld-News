    "text": "The Ogun State Government has rewarded some workers in the state civil service for their outstanding performances towards the growth of the state in 2023.\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun, who was represented by the Head of Service, Kolawole Fagbohum, said the rewards given to the individuals were meant to encourage effective and healthy competition among the state workforce to improve their performances for the continuous growth of the state.\nAbiodun stated this during the end-of-the-year thanksgiving and award of excellence organised by the Ministry of Environment in collaboration with other agencies, including Ogun State Environmental Protection Agency, and Ogun State Waste Management Authority, at the Government House in Abeokuta.\nThe awardees who received certificates and cash prizes were Olabamiji Akorede from the Ministry of Environment, Mrs Esther Adeyanju from Ogun State Environmental Protection Agency and Ibrahim Yusuf from Ogun State Waste Management Authority.\nA statement on Saturday read in part, “Governor Abiodun also used the opportunity to reiterate government determination to always prioritise workers welfare which can be attested to by the monthly palliative allowance to cushion the effects of removal of fuel subsidy and global economic meltdown, payment of peculiar allowances and the recently paid end-of-the-year special bonus to all categories of its workforce.\n“These allowances he said were effected without any labour unrest in the state which confirmed that the present administration is worker-friendly, pledging to always encourage them to always be the best they can be in the service through in-service training, upgrading and promotions.”",

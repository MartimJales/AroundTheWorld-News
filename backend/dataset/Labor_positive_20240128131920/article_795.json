    "text": "Canada announced rolling out\nDigital Nomad Visa 2024, in response to the changing landscape of the job market, as North American country is luring freelancers and digital nomads from across the globe.\nThe new work visa allows freelancers to have\ntemporary residence in Canada besides working remotely, the move aimed to end the requirement for physical presence in major cities.\nOttawa coined ‘independent contractors’ term for those individuals who will work from remote location in Canada, as the Trudeau government further simplifies procedures to facilitate remote work.\nIn the previous update,\nfreelancers used to get 6 months stay in Canada but with the larger influence, the size of Canadian workforce is increasing.\nCanadian officials emphasized the contributions of freelancers’ skills, saying the government is taking major steps to facilitate digital nomads who are okay to stay in the country. With the new move, Canada will boost country’s highly qualified IT professionals, and the duration will be increased to 3 years.\nAs of early Jan, the government hinted at a new scheme and the detailed remote work, Immigration, Refugees, and details about citizenship will be revealed in the coming months.\nIt was learnt that number of US citizens who work as digital nomads soared to 17.3 million, moving up by 2percent in 2023.\nApply for Canada Visa from Pakistan\nPakistanis can also apply for Canada Visit, via a temporary resident visa that allows South Asians to travel for tourism, business meetings, or to visit family members.\nFor Pakistanis, Canada Visitor Visa offers multiple entries over 10 years, allowing stays of 180 days per entry. To apply for a visa, applicants must be without criminal or immigration convictions.\nThe financial statement should be prove job, own residence, or family, to demonstrate a temporary visit intention. Adequate funds for the stay is also pre-requisite.\nRequired documents include a valid passport, national ID, and possibly additional documents like bank statements. The application process involves submission of form, checking accuracy, uploading supporting documents, followed by appointment at the local visa center.\nVisa and biometric fees need to be paid at center, and tracking information is shared.\n[Canada work visa protector fee update in Pakistan December 2023]",

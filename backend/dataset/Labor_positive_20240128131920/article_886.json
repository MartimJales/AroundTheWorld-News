    "text": "Photo shows (seated from left) Visayan Electric President and COO Engr. Raul Lucero; AboitizPower SAVP for Human Resources Belen Catanduanes; AboitizPower Distribution COO Anton Mari Perdices; Cebu Institute of Technology-University (CIT-U) President Engr. Bernard Nicolas Villamor; and CIT-U Vice-President for Academic Affairs Atty. Corazon Evangelista-Valencia sign the MOA and MOU for CIT-U, as witnessed by AboitizPower team members, some of whom are CIT-U alumni. THE distribution business group of Aboitiz Power Corporation (AboitizPower) strengthened its long-standing relationships with universities in Visayas and Mindanao in light of a shared vision to boost industry-based research and prepare the talent pipeline of electrical engineers.\nAboitizPower, through its distribution utilities, signed memorandums of agreement and memorandums of understanding with Mindanao State University – Iligan Institute of Technology, the University of Mindanao, Notre Dame University, University of San Jose-Recoletos, and Cebu Institute of Technology-University during ceremonies held in the latter part of 2023.\nThese signings formalize a long-established scholarship program for electrical engineering students, which includes the offering of employment opportunities to deserving graduates.\n“Our collaboration is a testament to our belief in the power of education, research, and technological advancement. By pooling our resources, expertise, and aspirations, we aim to catalyze change, not just in the energy sector, but in the lives of the people we serve,” said AboitizPower Distribution Utilities COO Anton Perdices.\n“Our vision for [these] partnership[s] extends far beyond training and scholarships. It’s about fostering a generation of engineers equipped with knowledge, practical experience, and an innovative spirit,” he added. “This initiative not only promotes academic excellence but also cultivates a pipeline of skilled professionals ready to contribute to the energy sector’s growth.”\nThe strengthening of such partnerships with universities draws inspiration from the distribution business group’s massive transformative purpose of empowering the growth of the cities and communities it serves, well beyond the provision of a reliable and cost-effective electricity supply.\nEarlier this year, a Philippine Power Industry HR Forum presented by the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, Inc. and AboitizPower indicated that skills and competency gaps or mismatch, a limited talent pool, and difficulty in retaining talent due to global and local competition are the most cited challenges in the human resources field of the Philippine energy sector.",

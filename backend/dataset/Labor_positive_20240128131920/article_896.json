    "text": "South Korea has officially rolled out a fresh visa for digital nomads, permitting foreigners to reside and work remotely while visiting the country. This new visa, known as the \"workcation\" visa, was initiated by the Korean Ministry of Justice and came into effect on January 1, 2024. Under this program, foreign nationals can work remotely for a foreign company from South Korea for a year, with an option to extend it for another year upon completion. This move aims to streamline the process for digital nomads, making it easier for them to combine work and vacation in South Korea. Unlike previous restrictions that limited remote workers to tourist visas or short-term stays of 90 days, this new system offers an extended period for digital nomads. It aims to support longer stays for employees and employers from foreign companies, fostering a more adaptable work environment while encouraging exploration of South Korea. Here are some guidelines for applying for the digital nomad visa in South Korea: - The visa permits foreigners to work in South Korea for up to two years. - It allows visa holders to bring their family members along. - Applicants must be at least 18 years old and have a minimum of one year's experience in their current field. - Proof of an annual income around $65,860 is required. - Applicants must demonstrate a clean criminal record and verify their employment status. - They also need to show evidence of having purchased travel health insurance. - Eligible candidates already in South Korea can apply for the digital nomad visa if they meet all requirements. - However, this visa doesn't allow digital nomads to seek employment within South Korea; a separate work visa is necessary for that purpose. - South Korean embassies abroad will handle applications for the digital nomad visa. - The new visa program will undergo a trial period, after which authorities will decide on its permanent adoption. This move by South Korea is seen as a step towards accommodating the changing work landscape, offering digital nomads an opportunity to work and explore the country without the constraints of short-term visas. The impact of this innovative visa scheme is anticipated to be evaluated during its trial phase before being potentially established permanently.

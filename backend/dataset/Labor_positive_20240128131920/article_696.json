    "text": "Recruitment firm Hays said the roles will also command above average pay\nThe most in-demand employees this year will include social workers, quantity surveyors and cyber security managers, a recruitment firm is predicting.\nHays said the roles will also command above average pay, adding that its research suggests half of workers intend to look for a new job in 2024.\nQualified social workers continue to be in demand due to the increased and complex care needs across the UK, said Hays.\nMeanwhile, other popular roles include cyber security managers – as organisations look to keep the threat of online attacks at bay – energy/carbon managers, accountants and special educational needs teaching assistants.\nCyber security managers are likely to earn the most (with an average salary of almost £84,000) followed by engineering project managers (£61,750).\nThe most in-demand employees this year will include social workers, quantity surveyors and cyber security managers, a recruitment firm is predicting. Pictured: File photo of a carer\nHays said the roles will also command above average pay, adding that its research suggests half of workers intend to look for a new job in 2024. Pictured: Someone working on a computer\nSimon Winfield, chief executive of Hays, said: ‘As we head into the new year, despite economic challenges, there remains just shy of one million unfilled jobs in the UK, leaving lots of opportunity for those who want to make their next career move.\n‘The roles featured on our list are at the top of employers’ wish lists up and down the country.’\nHe added: ‘If you’re thinking about a move in 2024, it’s good news as employers are much more willing to hire based on skills and aptitude, rather than just experience and qualifications.\n‘When applying for roles and in an interview setting, make sure to highlight the skills you’ve gained.’",

    "text": "Muscat: The Royal Navy of Oman, in coordination with the Ministry of Labour, received on Monday a new batch of citizens who began military training after they passed the stages of acceptance, evaluation, tests, and medical and physical examinations.\nThis comes as a continuation of the national efforts of the Sultan’s Armed Forces to absorb national competencies who meet the recruitment requirements. They will join the military training programme and be nominated as officers in the Royal Navy of Oman.\nThe Royal Navy of Oman has harnessed all its expertise and capabilities in terms of specialised manpower and administrative and health requirements, in order to provide an appropriate environment to achieve the speedy implementation of procedures for joining military service and fields of national duty.\nThese efforts are undertaken by the Sultan’s Armed Forces to accommodate the people of the nation in accordance with plans and programmes established to recruit national competencies into the Sultan’s Armed Forces and other departments of the Ministry of Defence. -ONA",

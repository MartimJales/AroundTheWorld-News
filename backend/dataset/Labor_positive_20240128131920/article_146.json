    "text": "The year 2023 closes with a southern economy marked by positive economic signs and a general resilience of businesses. These are the words of the annual economic analysis by Confindustria and SRM, the research centre linked to the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. In 2024, GDP growth in the South is estimated at +0.6%. \"The confirmation of this data,\" the study explains, \"will be considerably influenced by the actual \"grounding\" of the available resources, primarily those related to the PNRR. Employment, recorded in the third quarter, increased by 4% compared to last year, with an increase for the South; but the increase in employment does not correspond to a significant progress in absolute terms if the data are related to the share of those living in the South. The Synthetic Index of the Southern Economy for 2023 grew for the third consecutive year and rose by 8.8 points. The estimate of the figure for investments in the South is very positive, +4 percentage points compared to 2022 and 17 compared to 2019, \"confirming a dynamic that must certainly be strengthened\". The contribution of exports was particularly significant: +40 points on 2019.\nAll rights reserved Â© Copyright ANSA\nSimilar news: Confindustria-Srm: companies in the South are holding up, more investments - SMEs 24 mins Confindustria-Srm: companies in the South are holding up, more investments - SMEs 33 mins",

    "text": "December 30 – Thombert, Inc. Employees and members of United Auto Workers Local 997 reached an agreement with top officials on October 21 after nearly three months of protesting. According to the union's Facebook page, which has been posting frequent updates since August, the new contract has been signed. Representatives for UAW Local 997 did not immediately return phone calls from The Newton News by press time, so the contents of the contract remain unknown. When the strike first began, workers were frustrated, Thombert, Inc. had raised “leaps and bounds”, but it was not reflected in his pay cheque. Others argued that management's initial offer was an “insult” and “ridiculous”. Later that month, union groups from across the state joined Thombert workers on strike outside the company's Newton factory. Charlie Wishman, president of the AFL-CIO, the Iowa Federation of Labor, advocated for fair contracts. “We are here to show support and solidarity to let them know they are not alone,” he said. “Right now you have people from all walks of life, business, private sector, public sector. They're all here and in support of this because they want to make sure these people know we have their backs.” Iowa State Auditor Rob Sands showed his support for the union's efforts by meeting with individuals on the picket line earlier this month, as did state senators Nate Bolton and Sarah Garriott in September. US Senator Bernie Sanders also warned the local union on October 19, saying: “I stand in solidarity with the workers of UAW Local 997 in Newton, Iowa who have been on strike for more than (two) months. They are fighting for fair wages and health care costs and a better work-life balance. I “Call upon your employer, Thombert, Inc., to bargain in good faith.” Thombert is one of the world's largest manufacturers of polyurethane wheels and tires for narrow-aisle lift trucks. The manufacturer has been in business for several decades and operates out of Newton and Brooklyn.",

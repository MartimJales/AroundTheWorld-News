    "text": "MARYLAND (7News) — On January 1, the minimum wage in Maryland increased from $13.25 an hour to $15 an hour. 7News has been covering the push to raise the minimum wage - It's something that's been a priority for Maryland Governor Wes Moore. ALSO READ | [Maryland businesses prepare for upcoming minimum wage increase](https://wjla.com/news/local/maryland-businesses-prepare-for-upcoming-minimum-wage-increase-busboys-and-poets-national-federation-of-independent-business-tipped-workers-tips-small-businesses-prices) Moore said the increased minimum wage will affect 163,000 workers in Maryland and will benefit 120,000 children in the state. The new law raises the minimum wage two years ahead of schedule. In Montgomery County, large and mid-sized employers were already required to pay a minimum wage of $15 or more to their workers. 7News asked Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich to explain what the change will mean for smaller businesses with one to 10 employees. \"For those folks who were at $14.50, instead of waiting to July when inflation would have easily pushed this over 15, they will get their increase now,\" he said. Not everyone is supportive of increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Maryland Retailers Alliance opposes the change to the minimum wage. Last February, a spokesperson told 7News that increasing the minimum wage would, \"mean people will lose jobs, prices will go up, and as much as we believe this will lift people up, it will cause harm.” When 7News asked Elrich to respond to those comments, he called them \"nonsense.\" The Montgomery County Executive also thinks the current minimum wage in Maryland should be even higher. \"It's a big jump for the state, but it's still not where these wages have to end up. Someday we have to have the political courage to say the minimum wage should be a living wage,\" he said.",

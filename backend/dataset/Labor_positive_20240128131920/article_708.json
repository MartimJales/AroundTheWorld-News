You’ll choose from three specialisms; Corporate Responsibility, Quality Assurance and Marketing.\nYour time will be spent in that specific department, where you’ll work on personal and team projects, build relationships and solve problems in a complex environment. Yes, it can be daunting - but it is also a fantastic opportunity to learn and be inspired by a company that’s so different to all the others.\nReference: 50938550\nPlease note\nReed.co.uk does not communicate with candidates via Whatsapp, and we will never ask you to provide your bank, passport or driving licence details during the application process.

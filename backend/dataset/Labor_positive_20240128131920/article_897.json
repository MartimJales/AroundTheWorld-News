As of the end of November last year, the income was 107.6 billion yuan. The size of the labor insurance fund is 860.1 billion yuan, with a return rate of 12.31%. The performance of the new system’s labor retirement fund affects the dividends paid by the new system’s labor retirement contributions. According to statistics, the income from January to the end of November last year was 399.95 billion yuan. Based on the 12.51 million valid accounts of the new labor retirement system, the average dividend amount per household in the first 11 months of last year was 31,970 yuan. The new labor retirement fund will suffer a loss of 228.03 billion yuan in 2022, the largest loss in history; the new labor retirement fund will have satisfactory returns in 2023. Based on the current rate of return, the labor dividend in March will exceed 10%. The New Labor Retirement System Fund fixes the income of the year before distribution in March every year. The Ministry of Labor emphasized that the actual amount of income distributed to workers is related to the cumulative investment amount in the worker’s personal account, investment years and other factors. The monthly and annual accounting data are for reference only.

The market also expected that major central banks would terminate the cycle of interest rate hikes, which was beneficial to the performance of the stock market last year. . The Labor Fund Utilization Bureau further pointed out that the spillover effects of high interest rates continue to depress global economic performance, and coupled with global geopolitical risks, I am afraid that it will affect the recovery time of global trade. In the future, we will closely monitor the global political and economic situation and adjust the range of asset allocation changes. Within the scope, we actively manage the global diversified investment layout to enhance the long-term investment efficiency of the fund.

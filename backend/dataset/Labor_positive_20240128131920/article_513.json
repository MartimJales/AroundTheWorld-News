    "text": "Connecticut cannabis workers are celebrating after voting to ratify the state’s first-ever cannabis union contract, as workers hail the agreement as proof of the industry’s sustainability.\nWorkers at\nAdvanced Grow Labs in West Haven voted unanimously to ratify their union contract for a three-year agreement that includes guaranteed wage increases of up to 25% over three years, increased holiday pay, secured retirement and health insurance, increased safety measures, and on the job protection, according to a press release from the company.\n“It feels good to be represented and to have a contract that will secure our jobs,” said AGL Laboratory Technician Amber Sampiere. “This is a new and developing industry and we are at the forefront of creating a better future for cannabis workers.”\nBack in March, workers came together to form their union with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 919, becoming the first in the state to unionize.\n“The workers at Advanced Grow Labs made history by negotiating and ratifying the very first cannabis contract in Connecticut,” said Director of Organizing Emily Sabo. “We know their hard work will inspire more workers to form their unions and pave the way for a better Connecticut cannabis industry.”\nUFCW Local 919 represents thousands of cannabis workers across the country in dispensaries, labs, delivery, kitchens, manufacturing, processing, and grow facilities, according to their website. The national UFCW is America’s largest cannabis workers union and has been representing cannabis workers in states across the country for almost two decades.\n“These workers join the tens of thousands of other cannabis workers across the country to have formed their union with the UFCW and are ratifying union contracts,” Sabo said.\nThe union started the Cannabis Workers Rising campaign to help other workers unionize in the emerging cannabis industry.\n“I am proud to be a part of the first cannabis union in Connecticut,” said AGL Production Technician Alanna Daniels. “This has been a huge milestone for the industry in the state and our company. I hope other workers can come together like we have.”",

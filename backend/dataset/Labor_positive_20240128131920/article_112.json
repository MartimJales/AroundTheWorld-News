    "text": "List of Governors Who Declare 100K Christmas Bonus for Workers As Nigerians prepared for 2024, some governors rounded up 2023 with bogus bonuses for workers in their states by announcing N100,000 take-home for the Christmas celebrations. Legit.ng journalist Bada Yusuf is an accomplished politics and current affairs editor, boasting over seven years of experience in journalism and writing. The development came when Nigerians were facing the economic hardship that came with the removal of the fuel subsidy by President [Bola Tinubu](https://www.legit.ng/tags/945-bola-tinubu/). President Tinubu, on his part, was aware of the economic challenges and had consistently assured Nigerians that things would get better. Before embarking on his Christmas holiday, the president announced a 50 per cent slash in the cost of transportation for inter-state travelers while those taking the train will use it for free.

    "text": "Up to 50 jobs are set to be created next year when supermarket giant Aldi finally opens its new store in March.\nThe budget supermarket brand has confirmed it will be opening a planned new store on the town’s Hostmoor Avenue as part of a £6million investment by the firm across Cambridgeshire.\nFenland planners gave permission for the supermarket to be built at a meeting in July when councillors decided “shoppers would vote with their feet” once the store is up and running to determine whether or not it is wanted.\nFenland’s planning committee approved plans for the March Aldi in July 2023.\nThe value-chain pledged to either provide its own traffic management scheme to improve safety at the junction of Hostmoor Avenue and the A141 or provide a cash contribution towards the March Area Transport Strategy to provide a scheme as part of its planning application commitment.\nThe store is to be built on a 0.9 hectare brown acre site that stands on the corner of Hostmoor Avenue and Martin Avenue and is described by Aldi as ‘medium-sized’.\nThere will be 102 parking spaces on site and the store itself will have 1,804 sqm of internal space.\nAldi plans to open its new March store in 2024 with the creation of up to 50 jobs.\nAldi has previously said it has “long wanted” to open a store in March and that the March Trading Park was the ideal location.\nHowever, the plans did not go down well with everyone with rivals Tesco, located opposite the proposed store’s site, among those to object.\nAldi has long wanted to open a store in March.\nThe opening will follow planned upgrades to other Cambridgeshire stores and is part of a £1.4 billion investment being made by Aldi across the country thanks to numerous planned store openings in 2024.",

At its 55th International Conference and Exhibition Gala & Awards Night, held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, recently, the CIPM conferred Mohammed with a Fellowship, acknowledging his immense contributions to human relations practices and development in Nigeria.

As General Manager of Human Resources overseeing WACOT Rice Limited, a TGI Group company, Mohammed has played a crucial role in steering the company’s human capital management and aligning them with global best practices.

    "text": "\"Full agreement on the need to support employment, adequate wages and ensure safety in the workplace and efficient public health.\" This was expressed by the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, in a cordial telephone conversation with the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, during which she expressed her personal appreciation and that of the entire Government for the end-of-year message addressed to the Italian people. \"During the meeting, Meloni defined the President's speech as one of great depth and vision, particularly on the path towards peace and the end of conflicts, and expressed particular gratitude for the specific attention paid by the Head of State to the younger generations, their needs and their expectations.\" Meloni \"wished the president and his loved ones the best for 2024 and for the continuation of his mandate.\"\nSalvini: \"Clear words on peace, good on falsehoods\" \"The President of the Republic pronounces clear words on peace and the fight against all forms of terrorism, issues on which the League is and will always be at the forefront. Just as on other points touched on by the president, such as the institutional and cultural fight against violence against women. It is good that the increase in employment and the growth of Italy are recognized, something that the Democratic Party and the 5 Stars foolishly refuse to do. Our commitment in 2024 will also be to work on reforms such as Autonomy, Prime Minister and above all Justice. We want to prevent Italy from being held hostage by bureaucracy, slowness and partisan trade union and judicial minorities.\" Thus Matteo Salvini. \"Significant - underlines the deputy prime minister and leader of the League - is the passage where the president censures the tendency to spread falsehoods against those who are considered adversaries and even enemies. This is a particularly valuable step for those who, like the League, have suffered and are suffering media aggression and beyond.\"\nAll rights reserved Â© Copyright ANSA",

    "text": "CHENNAI: Dallas and Chennai-based product engineering firm Ideas2IT Technologies has announced a unique employee ownership programme wherein its employees will receive a 33% ownership stake. This is a first-of-its-kind move in the corporate landscape that has been so far limited to ESOPs, bonus, profit sharing or other options.Valued at over $100 million, Ideas2IT is allocating a significant 33% ownership stake to its employees, thereby rewarding long serving employees, many of whom have spent over a decade with them. To start with, Ideas2IT will grant this equity to the first 50 employees of the company followed by another 100 in line to join this pool. Unlike traditional ESOP plans that vest over time, this initiative offers direct equity ownership to employees. The equity also remains with the employees even if they part ways with the company, without affecting their salary structure. \\\"Ideas2IT is not merely distributing shares but handing over true founder privileges, including a say in the company's trajectory,\\\" the company said. \\\"The selection process is different from how ESOPs are typically allocated, as it focuses on values-driven contribution rather than just skill sets,\\\" it added.Founded in 2009 by Murali Vivekanandan and Bhavani Raman, Ideas2IT creates and delivers software to companies like Microsoft, Ericsson, Siemens and Roche. “The motivation behind this unprecedented initiative is an emotional commitment to build a top-tier product engineering company from India, with employees as true partners,” said Ideas2IT founder Murali Vivekanandan.This initiative follows a previous programme wherein Ideas2IT gifted 100 Maruti Suzuki cars to its trusted employees in 2022. The company is now doubling down on this promise by adding another 50 cars this year. With a team of 700 employees in total, Ideas2IT's expertise spans across various domains including AI/ML, cloud and application development and modernization.",

    "text": "As the new year approaches, Nearly 10 million workers in 22 states can expect a significant increase in their wages.\nThe Economic Policy Institute reported what increasing minimum wages will generate an additional $7 billion in annual wages for these workerswhich will mark a substantial economic change and a step towards solving the struggles related to inflation.\nThe states leading the wage increase movement\nStarting January 1, 2024, States like California,\nNew York and Washington will increase their base salary to at least $16 an hour, placing them at the forefront of the wage increase movement.\nThis increase is especially notable in the context of the federal minimum wage, which has stagnated at $7.25 an hour since 2009, despite a more than 40% increase in inflation. Twelve of the states that enacted these increases have tied their base pay to inflation, ensuring an annual adjustment that helps preserve workers’ purchasing power.\nWage increases will disproportionately benefit\nwomen and people of color. Around 60% of those who will benefit from the mandatory salary increase are womenwhile Hispanic and African American workers will also see significant impacts.\nThis change reflects not only economic adjustment, but a move towards greater equality and support for those who are often most vulnerable to exploitation. Beyond the immediate financial improvement, these changes are a victory for advocates pushing for fair and living wages for all workers.\nStates that will increase their minimum wage on January 1, 2024 and their new salary\n- Alaska: $11.73\n- Arizona: $14.35\n- California: $16\n- Colorado: $14.42\n- Connecticut: $15.69\n- Delaware: $13.25\n- Hawaii: $14\n- Illinois: $14\n- Maine: $14.15\n- Maryland: $15\n- Michigan: $10.33\n- Minnesota: $10.85\n- Measures: $12.30\n- Mountain: $10.30\n- Nevada: $12\n- New Jersey: $15.13\n- New York: $16\n- Ohio: $10.45\n- Rhode Island: $14\n- Dakota del Sur: $11.20\n- Vermont: $13.67\n- Washington: $16.28\nBroader implications and future increases\nWhile many employers have already increased their starting wages due to a tight labor market, these state-mandated increases are crucial as they ensure sustained wage gains for workers.\nStarting January 1, workers in six states will enjoy a base wage that is more than double the federal minimum wage. However, the fight for fair wages is not over: 20 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, still adhere to the federal limit of $7.25.\nLooking ahead, states like Florida, Nevada and Oregon will also raise their minimum wages later in 2024, continuing the trend of state-led efforts to financially support workers.\nThe start of 2024 marks a significant moment for workers’ rights and economic policy, as all 22 states implement minimum wage increases.\nThis measure, which is expected to benefit nearly 10 million workers and inject billions into the\neconomy, is a response to the current fight against inflation and the stagnation of the federal minimum wage.\nAs states take the lead in ensuring a fair wage for their workers, the nation watches and waits to see the broader impact of these increases, both economically and socially.\nWhile there is still a long way to go, these increases are a step in the right direction and promise a slightly brighter and more equitable new year for millions of Americans.\nKeep reading:\n· Changes in the minimum wage in\nNew York within 11 days: the agreed values for 2024\n· New minimum wage for New Yorkers starting January 1: What should workers know?\n· Laws will defend privacy in social networks of workers and inclusive hairdressing in\nNew York from 2024\n2023-12-28 22:39:22\n#York #leads #minimum #wage #increase #states #starting #January #Diario",

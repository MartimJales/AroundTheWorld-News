    "text": "Incoming Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine is beginning the new year with a new job title. Long Islanders in Suffolk County have said they are ready for change. Steve Bellone, a Democrat, has served as county executive for the past 12 years and today begins a new chapter for Romaine, a Republican, who will be sworn in. In his victory speech in November, Romaine said his goal as county executive would be to keep Suffolk safe. Romaine said he planned to do that by ensuring law enforcement has the tools they need to do their job. He also says he wants to make Suffolk affordable and plans to do that with low taxes. Political expert Mike Dawidziak said doing so will have its hurdles. \"One of the things you have to do for that, particularly on a county level, is economic development. You have to have good paying jobs here so people can buy houses here and affordable housing and that's certainly a major challenge,\" said Dawidziak. The inauguration will be happening later today at Eastport South Manor High School.",

    "text": "You've probably heard the old saying that lightning never strikes the same place twice. Investors interpret this idea to mean that a stock will not experience wild growth for two consecutive years. The thing is that lightning can really shine and does Hit the same spot twice. Tall trees and skyscrapers are often targets. And in the same sense, a hot ticker can record two big, back-to-back annual profits. You just have to find the right stock! Although its shares gained 280% IonQ (IONQ -6.35%) While 2023 will certainly be a tough act to follow, there's no reason to believe 2024 can't be another bullish year. In fact, there are four specific reasons why the coming year could be another winning year for IonQ stock. in no particular order… 1. The world is starting to see the potential of quantum computing Most investors have probably heard the term “quantum computing.” However, it would be no exaggeration to say that most investors don't really know what it is or why they should care; The leading players in the budding business have not made it at all easy for the average person to understand. However, this is the year that could change investors' perspective towards companies in business. Furthering this understanding will be the practical use of quantum computers in powering technologies that investors are more familiar with, such as artificial intelligence (AI), and particularly generative AI. And as it turns out, IonQ is setting up shop in this corner of the artificial intelligence market. In August, the company announced an agreement with Zapata AI to “unleash new potential benefits of quantum computing that can help solve complex real-world business problems,” building on its already created generative Expanding on AI partnerships. It remains to be seen what any final product of this collaboration will be or look like, but the companies are looking to solve real business problems. It is practical, tangible projects like this that will make IonQ's technology real and practical for interested investors. 2. The technical advantages of IonQ will be highlighted The mainstreaming and better understanding of quantum computing is likely to have another beneficial impact on IonQ stock. That is, they will highlight the fact that IonQ is years ahead of many of its peers in terms of practical application with its simple quantum-computing solution. In layman's terms, quantum computers use subatomic particles such as ions, photons or electrons to handle calculations instead of the metal or silicon circuits used in most modern computers. Thus quantum computers are infinitely faster than conventional computers. However, there exists more than one type of subatomic particle suitable to serve as the basis of a quantum computer. IonQ's trapped-ion approach is one of the easiest methods to utilize and commercialize. And that's exactly what the company is doing. This is in contrast to most other organizations developing quantum-computing platforms. Take Alphabetof (GOOG -0.25%) (GOOGL -0.39%) Google and IBM (IBM -0.12%) as an example. Both plan to introduce utility-scale quantum-computing solutions by 2030, with IBM set to unveil a less powerful quantum-computing platform sometime earlier. The superconducting-based qubits on which these systems are built are difficult and expensive to use. The same can be said for Microsoft(MSFT 0.20%) Quantum-computing efforts that rely on relatively rare Marjorana particles. These alternatives could ultimately provide more computing power than IonQ's trapped-ion technology, and solve problems with greater accuracy. But the technology is years away from being ready for widespread commercial use. IonQ is building a working, commercialized, trapped-ion quantum computer Now! Which are much more powerful. The fact that the company reported revenue of $6.1 million last quarter and generated an additional $26.3 million during the same three months confirms that enterprises and institutions are ready for high-end computing solutions, even if they Be lower than the state. -The art solution a decade from now. 3. Moving toward a major milestone vision Speaking of technology, as IonQ continues to refine its trapped-ion quantum-computing system, the company expects another big leap forward in 2024, setting the stage for a technological “quantum leap” in 2025 . But first things first. Investors with their finger on the pulse of quantum computing have probably heard the term algorithmic qubit, or AQ for short. It is a measure of the number of subatomic particles within a functioning quantum-computing system at any time. In more basic terms, it is a measure of computing power or speed. IonQ's most powerful quantum-computing platform – Forte – boasts an #AQ number of 29, although the company hopes to produce systems reaching an #AQ figure of 35 in 2024. However, something is likely to happen next year that could prove to be game-changing. In 2025, IonQ believes it will be able to offer a quantum-computing platform with an #AQ score of 64. This is not a small milestone. As IonQ's third quarter earnings release explains, “The company believes that in reaching this #AQ milestone, its systems will provide quantum advantage for certain use cases and that classical computers can now use IonQ systems will not be able to fully simulate.” Reaching an #AQ of 35 is likely to draw attention to the fact that a #AQ score of 64 is within reach. 4. Mergers and acquisitions are in progress Last but not least, 2024 could be another good year for IonQ stock as the tech giant and other quantum-computing start-ups are clearly looking for ways to better position themselves to capitalize on a huge opportunity. Have been. This is not a prediction that IonQ will be acquired (which, by the way, is a lousy sole basis for owning a stock). But IonQ doesn't need to find a buyer to enter the market or benefit from the widespread rush to grow. Demand for intellectual property from other developers alone could be enough to push IonQ shares to an even more premium valuation. This is not a prediction that is pulled out of a hat. Gernot Berger, senior manager (and physicist) at VC HTGF, a German investment management organization, believes that big tech companies will “consolidate their position in the quantum-computing field this year through strategic alliances, collaborations and, above all, , will explore potential acquisitions”. Quantum Insider's Matt Swain predicts a wave of dealmaking this year, as “research results have been promising, which is likely to attract larger companies sitting on the sidelines.” IonQ CEO Peter Chapman expects the quantum-computing industry's next year will resemble last year's race to buy and/or build conversational AI solutions once ChatGPT is made available to the public. Whatever is in the cards in this regard, it should create a tailwind for IonQ stock. Respect the risk, but don't ignore the potential Another guaranteed mega-profit from IonQ shares in 2024? No, there are no guarantees when it comes to stock picking… even if the story is as compelling as this company's. While awareness and understanding of quantum computing is beginning to increase, institutional funding of these companies and quantum-computing projects is decreasing, with financial backers becoming more selective about the projects they want to acquire. Practical revenue potential is now becoming a factor behind funding. As Quantum Insider's Sven writes, quantum start-ups and/or their stocks are “really, really expensive.” This is certainly a handicap, compounded by the fact that IonQ remains in the red. However, it's a dynamic that arguably plays into the hand that IonQ is holding, rather than working against it. The company already has practical, concrete solutions to sell in a market that is beginning to recognize the potential of quantum computing; Generative AI is a particularly exciting opportunity right now. Thus, analysts believe IonQ will post top-line growth of around 80% in 2024, followed by potential revenue growth of around 95% in 2023. This is an above average risk, to be sure, and the stock will almost certainly continue to have above average volatility. If you can stomach both, this year could be another winning period for IonQ stock. Source: www.fool.com",

[Mums , dads and legal guardians](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/parents) are legally entitled to take more time off for each child and adopted child, up to their 18th birthday. The rule, called parental leave, is bound by certain requirements but is the right of everyone in employment. Most people know you’re entitled to statutory family leave if your child is sick. However lesser known reasons include looking around for schools or taking them to see grandparents.

Under the government-backed unpaid leave rules, the limit on how much parental leave each [parent](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-family) can take in a year is four weeks for each child. Parents must also take it as whole weeks, rather than individual days, unless your employer agrees otherwise or if your child is disabled. However you don’t have to take all the leave at once. The Gov.UK website reads: \"An employee is entitled to 18 weeks. If they’ve used 10 with a previous employer, they can use up to eight weeks with their new employer if they’re [eligible](https://www.gov.uk/parental-leave/eligibility).\" It adds: \"If an employee works 3 days a week, one ‘week’ of parental leave equals 3 days. If an employee works irregular weeks the number of days in a ‘week’ is the total number of days they work a year divided by 52.\" The Government stresses on its [www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) website: \"Eligible employees can take unpaid parental leave to look after their child’s welfare. For example to spend more time with their children, look at new schools, settle children into new childcare arrangements, spend more time with family, such as visiting grandparents.\" To be eligible for parental leave you must: - Have been in the company for more than a year - Be named on the child’s birth or adoption certificate or they have or expect to have [parental responsibility](https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility) - Not be a self-employed or a ‘worker’, eg an agency worker or contractor - Not a foster parent (unless they’ve secured parental responsibility through the courts) - The child is under 18 Employers can ask for proof (like a birth certificate) as long as it’s reasonable to do so. Parental leave must be taken a week at a time but you don’t have to take it all at once. If an employee works irregular weeks, the number of days in a ‘week’ is the total number of days they work a year divided by 52. If your child is on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Personal Independence Payment (PIP), you can take parental leave one day at a time. Reasons you're allowed to take unpaid leave include: - spend more time with their children - look at new schools - settle children into new childcare arrangements - spend more time with family, such as visiting grandparents Their [employment rights](https://www.gov.uk/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (like the right to pay, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during parental leave. How much parental leave can I take? Each parent can take up to 18 weeks of parental leave in total for each child, until the child turns 18. You can take up to 4 weeks per child per year. If you have two children, you can take up to eight weeks per year. Leave can’t be postponed (delayed) if: - the employer doesn’t have a ‘significant reason’, eg it would cause serious disruption to the business - it’s being taken by the father or partner immediately after the birth or adoption of a child - it means an employee would no longer qualify for parental leave, eg postponing it until after the child’s 18th birthday If it’s postponed, the employer: - must write explaining why within 7 days of the original request - suggest a new start date - this must be within 6 months of the requested start date - can’t change the amount of leave being requested What to do if you need to take time to look after your children: Speak to your manager - Different employers have different policies. They may allow you to take paid time off, annual leave or to make up the hours later in the week. Request parental leave - If you need more than a week off, ask for parental leave. You will have to have been working for your employer for more than a year. Request dependant leave - this is for use in emergencies. If your manager refuses, you may have to leave anyway. If they try to discipline or sack you for leaving you can get support from Citizens Advice. Even if you don’t qualify for parental leave, you should be able to get time off to deal with genuine family emergencies. You have the right to take a reasonable amount of unpaid time off to deal with certain emergencies involving people you care for. You qualify for “time off for dependents” regardless of how long you have been working for your employer.

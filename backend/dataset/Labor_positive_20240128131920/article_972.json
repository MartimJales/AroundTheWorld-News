WASHINGTON, Jan. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- [The Cargo Airline Association (CAA)](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4056890-1&h=3346876930&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cargoair.org%2F&a=The+Cargo+Airline+Association+(CAA)), the leading advocacy organization for the air cargo industry, today named Brianna Manzelli as Managing Director for Legislative Policy. Manzelli joins CAA from Senator Mitt Romney's (R-Utah) office where she served as Senior Advisor and Communications Director, advising on major policy initiatives including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Brianna brings 10 years of experience working in Congress and the Administration on key aviation initiatives. In her new role, Ms. Manzelli will be responsible for leading legislative policy on a broad range of issues for the air cargo industry and representing CAA members before the U.S. Congress and other government agencies. She will work closely with CAA members to advance legislative priorities that ensure the safety, security, efficiency, and resiliency of this critical sector of the U.S. economy. \"Brianna brings tremendous experience and a diverse professional network on Capitol Hill, in government agencies and across the industry,\" said Lauren Beyer, CAA President. \"She has a proven record of working collaboratively across stakeholders and will be a great value to CAA's members.\" \"At a time when air cargo plays an increasingly important role in the global economy, I am excited to join the CAA team and build on the organization's government affairs efforts,\" said Manzelli. \"I look forward to bringing my government experience and industry knowledge to bear on the issues critical to the association and ensure its members' voices are heard in Washington.\" Before joining Senator Romney, Manzelli served as Assistant Administrator for Communications at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) where she helped lead the agency's communications and policy strategy, including the Boeing 737 MAX recertification and the COVID-19 pandemic. She served as Senior Advisor to the FAA Administrator in addition to being the agency's chief spokesperson. Prior to the FAA, Brianna held positions at the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee under Chairmen Roger Wicker and John Thune. At the Committee, she worked on aviation issues including the 2018 FAA Reauthorization and the response to the Boeing 737 MAX crashes and grounding.

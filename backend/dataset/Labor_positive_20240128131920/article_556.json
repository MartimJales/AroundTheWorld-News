    "text": "Barbara Cramer was hired at the McDonald's in Fort Pierce, Florida, in 1970. This December, she celebrated her 53rd year working beneath the Golden Arches.\nThe 75-year-old\ntold WPTV,\nI just love it here.\nMcDonald's holds a special place in her heart: Not only has she worked for the chain for more than half a century, but she also met her first husband while working at the first location where she was hired. After he passed away, she met her second husband while working at another local McDonald's.\nA lot has changed at McDonald's during Cramer's long career. Just take a look at this menu from the year she was hired!\nBack then you could literally order one of everything on the menu and not spend more than $5. Now you'd be hard-pressed to find a burger on the menu that costs less than that.\nWhile Cramer is semi-retired now, she says she has no plans to fully retire in the near future, so if you happen to be driving by (or should I say driving-thru?) the Fort Pierce McDonald's, make sure you stop and congratulate Mrs. Cramer on her legendary career!\n ",

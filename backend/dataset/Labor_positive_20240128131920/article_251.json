    "text": "Unique program helping employ those with disabilities MISHAWAKA, Ind. -- A unique program is helping pave opportunities for those with disabilities in our community. Corvilla is a non-profit organization that offers residential, day and employment services to its clients. Part of the employment services includes a program with StudioFive9, where clients get to create artwork that they can then sell and profit off of. It gives them a chance to earn a paycheck for something they're passionate about doing. Clients can also find employment with one of Corvilla's partner businesses, like Martin's or Meijer. The Corvilla site in Mishawaka also features a showroom, with lots of unique, hand-crafted furniture for sale that the clients helped create. All of the money earned from sales goes right back to the Corvilla artist who made it. If you'd like to learn more about Corvilla's services, [head to their website!](https://www.corvilla.org/services) To view client art on sale, head to [Studio Five9's website](https://www.studiofive9.com/). You can also make purchases directly from the Corvilla site in Mishawaka, or the Kroc Center in South Bend! To donate towards Corvilla and help support the work they're doing for the local special needs population, [visit this website.](https://corvillainc-bloom.kindful.com/)",

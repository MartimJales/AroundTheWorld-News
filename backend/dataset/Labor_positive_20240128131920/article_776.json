    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. â€” There are more than 1,000,000 active-duty military members protecting our freedom in the armed forces, but most of them won't make the military their career. In this week's Stories of Service, First Coast News focuses on the work the organization, 'Operation New Uniform' (ONU) does to help members of the military transition to their second career. Last fall, a classroom full of active-duty servicemembers and veterans gathered to celebrate their transition to the business world through Operation New Uniform's transition training program. Operation New Uniform, a 501c3 nonprofit, was founded in 2013 to serve the needs of transitioning servicemembers from all branches of service, with the goal of helping them find their \"new uniform,\" their new career in the business world. The Jacksonville-based company, Swisher, committed $50,000 to sponsor the training of 14 Jacksonville-area military members. In 2023, Swisher launched the Veterans of Valor Employee Resource Group, which develops programming, supports community causes and provides opportunities to raise awareness for veteran issues throughout the year. More information about Operation New Uniform can be found on their website [here](https://www.onuvets.org/).

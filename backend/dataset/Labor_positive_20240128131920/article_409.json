    "text": "LEBANON, Va. – Bates Family Farm, LLC plans to invest nearly $1 million to relocate its manufacturing facility to a 40,000 square foot building owned by Russell County to meet growing consumer demand for its skincare products.\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the plans last week in a written statement.\nThe local firm plans to hire an addition 12 employees due to the expansion.\nThis space will allow for the development of new products, additional production capacity and warehouse space, according to the statement.\nIn addition, Bates Family Farm, LLC plans to construct a new creamery to produce food products, bottled goat milk and artisan cheeses, for wholesale and retail distribution.\nBates Family Farm, LLC is committed to purchasing 100% of all expected agricultural products from Virginia, an increase of more than $2 million over the next three years as a result of this expansion, according to the statement.\nPeople are also reading…\n“This project increases economic development activity in Russell County, provides new jobs in a rural area and demonstrates our support of the Commonwealth’s dairy industry and to Virginia’s entire agricultural community,” Youngkin said in a statement.\nYoungkin approved a $70,000 grant from the Governor’s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development (AFID) Fund, which Russell County will match with local funds.\nThe Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services worked with Russell County and the Russell County Industrial Development Authority to secure the project for the Commonwealth.\nShannon and Joseph Bates established Bates Family Farm in 2013. The company produces a full line of goat milk-based skincare products including soap, lotion, lip balm and body cream. They are sold in over 1,000 retail stores and specialty shops across the U.S.\n“This AFID grant award and the support we have received from Russell County are critical factors in our decision to move forward with this project. We are honored to grow our business in the county we call home and be part of Virginia’s agricultural community,” said Bates Family Farm CEO Joseph Bates.\n“Russell County is committed to continuing to focus on agribusiness as a growing and vital part of our local economy,” said Russell County Industrial Development Authority Executive Director Ernie McFaddin. “This project will not only create jobs and investment in the county, but also grow the business’ contributions to local tax revenues.”\n— Twitter: @DMcGeeBHC",

    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box.\nVirginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office.\nThat's a victory for Democrats.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate.\nThat's another victory for the left.\nTwo ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state.\n Driver violated red light in 70th Street and Nebraska Parkway crash, LPD says These LFR responds to fire at Lazlo's in south Lincoln Nebraska football reserve linebacker enters transfer portal Double 17- Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin.\nThese electoral victories make a difference.\nGrover Norquist: Republicans stopped the bleeding in 2023 while Bidenomics failed\nJust look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize.\nLabor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts.\nWorkers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers.\nSometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans.",

    "text": "Eager fans of a popular coastal resort in Lincolnshire could make it their next place of work in 2024. Around 50 jobs have opened at Butlin's in Skegness, including team leaders, cleaners and maintenance crews. The [jobs](https://jobs.butlins.com/en/postings/ac9215e4-e9b4-4f07-8282-f2033251faaf) will coincide with the opening of 128 new premium lodges in May, which will form the new Maple Walk village. Jeremy Fletcher, the resort's director, said: \"This gives anyone looking for a change this year the chance to be part of something brand-new and the opportunity to start a career with us at a really exciting time.\" He added: \"2024 is going to be an incredible year at Butlin’s Skegness. Following an amazing 2023 where we opened Butlin's SKYPARK and our new-look fairground, this year sees the launch of our brand-new premium lodges and the Maple Walk village.\" Poll: [What's the best sandwich shop in Lincolnshire?](https://xd.wayin.com/display/container/dc/7fc365a3-1d67-40e2-a670-6ead5bab8603) The jobs are a mix of part-time and full-time roles, catering to different levels of experience, and training will be offered. Maple Walk will also recruit additional members of the resort's safety team and 'welcome hosts'. The recruitment process is carried out in four main stages, beginning with an application before progressing to a review, a phone interview, and then a recruitment session. Opening for the May half-term, the lodges will be able to sleep a maximum of six guests and will be situated less than five minutes from the heart of the main resort. The £12m village will also feature a new play area and some lodges will be fitted for disabled access. A limited-time offer is also up for grabs for families hoping to get their 2024 holidays booked early. The breaks start at £59 on a term-time deal, and there's an additional 10 per cent off all holidays in place until January 16. Likewise, the adults-only Big Weekenders will start at £69 per person with a 30 per cent discount available on all events, up until January 16.",

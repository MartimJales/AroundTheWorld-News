    "text": "The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions within the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has recently eased Leave Travel Concession (LTC) regulations for Central Government employees. In a recent Office Memorandum dated December 21, 2023, the ministry announced that, with the concurrence of financial advisers, ministries or departments, and subordinate or attached offices (with the concurrence of the Head of Department, not below the rank of Joint Secretary), can now approve reimbursement claims related to LTC journeys for up to six months without referring to the DoPT if no advance is drawn. According to a report on ET, in cases where an advance is drawn, the approval period is extended to three months, provided the entire advance amount is repaid within three months. It is mandated that the entire sum be recovered in a lump sum, and interest will be levied on the total advance amount from the date of drawal to the date of recovery.These stipulations are applicable when a Central Government employee is unable to submit the claim within the prescribed time limit under rules 14 and 15 of CCS(LTC) Rules, 1988, due to circumstances beyond their control, according to the ministry, ET report added. The ministry further clarified that this new Office Memorandum supersedes the earlier DoPT’s OM No. 31011/05/2007-Estt.(A) dated 27.09.2007. Issued with the concurrence of the Department of Expenditure, these instructions are effective from the date of the Office Memorandum's issuance, as stated by the ministry. Ministries, departments, attached offices, and subordinate offices are urged to consider these guidelines when processing belated LTC claims.",

    "text": "From the Henssler Financial Studio this is your news minute on the Marietta Daily Journal Podcast presented by Engineered Solutions of Georgia. Today is Monday, January 1st, and I'm\nKeith Ippolito.\nMetro Atlanta posts strong job growth in November\nIn a notable development, the jobless rate in metro Atlanta dipped to 4.2% in November, compared to 4.3% the previous month. The data, provided by the State Department of Labor, indicates a solid job market, especially in the retail and hospitality sectors, reflecting a boost in shopping, dining, and entertainment activities.\nThis year, Atlanta's economic resilience has been conspicuous, attracting talent from across the state and contributing to the majority of new jobs in Georgia. The growth in the job market exceeded expectations, contradicting earlier predictions of an economic downturn. However, certain companies, including FAB Precision Sheetmetal and Truist Bank, have announced layoffs and branch closures, underscoring challenges within specific sectors.\nDespite these variations, Atlanta's job base grew by 2.47% over the past year, outpacing both the state and national growth rates. With an unemployment rate of 4.2%, the city continues to demonstrate its economic vitality.\nFor more news about our community, visit\nmdjonline.com.

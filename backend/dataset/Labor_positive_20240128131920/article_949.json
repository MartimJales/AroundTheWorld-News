    "text": "Karimnagar : Chairman of NAFSCOB, TSCAB and Karimnagar DCCB Konduru Ravinder Rao has stressed on the continuous learning and capacity building programmes for the employees of all levels at Karimnagar District Cooperative Central Bank to gear up for the future requirement.\n“We will approach the NABARD and design courses for all level officers including senior level officers and organise exposure visits and make training as a continuous process”, he pointed out. The continuous learning is not an option but a well-thought-out strategy and path to growth. In this pursuit of knowledge, it is important to know your own strengths and weaknesses and, most importantly, recognise the way you learn. Knowing the best way you learn and what motivates you in that process helps you accomplish your learning goals efficiently, he stated.\nAlso Read NAFSCOB chairman asks banks to encourage unemployed youth to take up Agri Clinics, Agri Business Centres Participating in the New Year celebrations at the DCCB main office in Karimnagar town on Monday by cutting the cake and distributing the same among the employees, Mr Ravinder Rao said that ‘everywhere is the competitive world including the bank sector.

    "text": "The Uttarakhand government has notified that deceased dependents will get a chance in the state’s government job recruitment. With this decision, there will be an opportunity for recruitment for all Group C/D posts in the Himalayan state. The state government introduced amendments to rules for dependents of deceased government servants that will enable them to apply for suitable employment in Group D or Group C posts, that is the post of Junior Assistant or its equivalent\nAs per a government order dated December 28, amendments have been made to the Uttar Pradesh Recruitment of Dependants of Government Servants Dying in Harness Rules, 1974 (Adaptation and Modification Order, 2002).\nCM Pushkar Singh Dham’s government had given its go-ahead in the cabinet meeting held on 22 December. The government issued its notification on December 28.As per the notified amendment, the revised rule states that if a government servant dies in harness after the commencement of these rules and the spouse or a family member is not employed under the Central Government, any State Government, or a government-controlled corporation, may apply for suitable employment in Group D or Group C, such as the post of Junior Assistant or its equivalent. The modified rules, titled the “Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh Recruitment of Dependants of Government Servants Dying in Harness Rules, 1974) (Amendment) Rules, 2023,” have come into immediate effect, the order stated.This relaxation of normal recruitment rules is contingent upon the applicant meeting educational qualifications, being otherwise qualified for Government service, and submitting the application within five years of the Government servant’s demise, the order said. The amendment emphasizes placing such employment, whenever feasible, within the same department where the deceased government servant was previously employed, aiming to provide support and opportunities for the dependents of the deceased public servants.",

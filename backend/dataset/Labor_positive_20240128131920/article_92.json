    "text": "Containers are stacked at a pier in South Korea's largest port city of Busan, Dec. 1. Yonhap\nKorea's terms of trade rose for the sixth consecutive month in November as import costs fell at a faster pace than export prices, central bank data showed Friday.\nThe country's net terms-of-trade index for goods — a gauge of overall trade terms — improved 1.6 percent last month from a year ago, following the previous month's 1.1 percent rise, according to the preliminary data from the Bank of Korea (BOK).\nThe index shows the amount of imports a country can buy for each unit of exports, with a lower figure meaning worse trade terms.\nImport prices fell 5.1 percent on-year last month, sharper than the 3.5 percent dip in export prices.\nIt is calculated by dividing the index for export prices by that for import prices.\nKorea's exports grew 7.8 percent in November, driven by a rebound in semiconductor shipments for the first time in 16 months.\nAsia's fourth-largest economy saw its monthly exports turn around for the first time in 13 months in October.

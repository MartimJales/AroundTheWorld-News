    "text": "Panna Cotta with Berry Sauce (VIDEO)\nPanna Cotta looks and tastes fancy but is quick and easy to make! The fresh berry sauce makes every creamy spoonful perfectly sweet and tangy.\nWe love these mini desserts for parties! Some of our favorites include\nchocolate mousse, these raspberry mousse cups, or mini cheesecakes. They are elegant and surprisingly simple.\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Read my\ndisclosure policy.\nPanna Cotta Recipe:\nI recreated this Panna Cotta after trying it in the Papa Haydn restaurant. It was love with the first spoonful, but my frugal self didn‚Äôt like paying $8/ serving. I could make 6 servings for that price tag at home! I actually like this homemade version more with the fresh berry sauce.\nGood news! This Panna Cotta takes about 20 min to make before refrigeration. Easy, peasy!\nWhat is Panna Cotta?\nPanna Cotta is a creamy Italian jello/pudding like dessert. It has an incredibly smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture like nothing else. The name means ‚Äúcooked cream.‚Äù It is often served in restaurants removed from it‚Äôs cup onto a plate, but we prefer it served in cups topped with berry sauce.\nP.S. If you aren‚Äôt able to find the unflavored gelatin in the baking aisle of your grocery store, you probably weren‚Äôt looking hard enough (kidding). You can\nstock up on Amazon (affiliate link).\nIs this a Make-Ahead Dessert?\nYES! Panna Cotta can be made in advance so it is perfect for entertaining! Serve it in wine glasses at your next dinner party, or in tiny shot glasses for a larger gathering (think: baby shower, bridal shower, church potluck, etc.).\nAdd the berry sauce and garnish with basil if desired just before serving.\nToppings for Panna Cotta:\nWe love the berry sauce (strawberries, raspberries, lemon juice and a bit of sugar) because it ends up in every spoonful, but you can also top with:\n- Fresh Berries\n- Shaved Chocolate\n- Whipped Cream\n- Sliced stone fruit like peaches or cherries\n- Diced Mangos\nWatch How To Make Panna Cotta:\nI hope you are excited to give this recipe a try! Be sure to report back and let me know how much you loved it.\nPanna Cotta with Berry Sauce\nIngredients\nIngredients for Panna Cotta:\n- 1 cup whole milk\n- 2 1/2 tsp unflavored gelatin, (1 packet Knox gelatin)\n- 2 cups heavy whipping cream\n- 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp granulated sugar\n- pinch\nsalt\n- 1 tsp\nvanilla extract\n- 1 cup sour cream\nIngredients for Berry Sauce:\n- 2 cups berries, divided (I used 1 cup raspberries and 1 cup quartered or halved strawberries)\n- 3 Tbsp granulated sugar\n- 1/2 Tbsp\nlemon juice\nInstructions\nHow to Make Panna Cotta:\n- Off the heat, place 1 cup milk in a medium sauce pan and sprinkle the top with 1 packet gelatin. Let stand 3-5 min or until gelatin is softened. Place pan over medium/low heat and stir until gelatin dissolves and mixture is steaming, about 4-5 min (do not boil).\n- Add 2 cups heavy whipping cream, 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Continue stirring about 5 min until sugar is fully dissolved and mixture is steaming (do not boil). Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes.\n- Place sour cream in a medium bowl with a pouring lip. Whisking constantly, gradually add warm cream. Once the mixture is completely smooth, divide it into 6 wine glasses or 8 ramekins. Refrigerate until fully set; 4 to 6 hours.\nHow to Make Berry Sauce:\n- In a small sauce pan, combine 1 cup berries, 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice and 3 Tbsp sugar. Bring to a low boil and cook 4-5 min or until syrupy.\n- Stir in remaining 1 cup of fresh berries and remove from heat. When syrup is at room temp or just barely warm, spoon it over the top of chilled panna cottas.\nNutrition Per Serving\nIf you make this recipe, I‚Äôd love to see pics of your creations on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter! Hashtag them\n#natashaskitchen\nMake this for someone you love. The flavor and texture are incredible and it‚Äôs a memorable treat!\n[Read comments/reviews](#) [Add comment/review](#respond)\n-\nI just made this and substituted monk fruit sugar. I put a dollop of coulis on the bottom of the glass and added the mixture over top. It‚Äôs been 7 hours and it hasn‚Äôt set. It looks like pudding.\nWhile I‚Äôm sure it will be delicious, what do you feel was the culprit?\n-\nHello, i was wondering How far in advance can they be made? Will they be ikay in the fridge for 5 days?\n-\nCan we use vegan gelatin instead? would it alter the taste? and what brand would you suggest? Thank you üòä\n-\nHi Natasha!\nDo you think the cream can be chilled on an angle, ie, is it firm enough for those ‚Äòangular‚Äô presentations? Thank you! Can‚Äôt wait to try.\n-\nI love this recipe! I have made it several times and it is always a hit with friends!\nToday I made it with 3/4 cup of pumpkin and light spices of ginger, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Delicious! Thank you for a great recipe!\n-\nFirst, let me say that I‚Äôve never heard of Panna Cotta before seeing it on your site. That being said, after making it far more than I care to admit over the last couple months‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs by far my favorite dessert now. I‚Äôm a firm believer of sticking to the recipe, as written, for the first several times. Having made it 5-6 times now, I‚Äôve only changed 2 processes that elevated it. I found that the thing I loved the most was the light and creamy texture of the custard, so to maintain that texture‚Ä¶ I ran an immersion blender through the sauce after it finished on the stove and pushed it through a sieve. The resulting sauce was seedless and blissfully smooth as it pours on top of the custard. The only other thing I modified was waiting til I removed the finished cream from the heat to add the vanilla. By waiting to add the vanilla until it‚Äôs done being heated, it retains more of the vanilla flavor. Anyway‚Ä¶ you rock and this recipe is outstanding. Thank you!\n-\n-\nHi, I‚Äôve never made pannacotta with sour cream before, but would like to try it.I usually make coffee flavour just by adding espresso powder when heating the cream. Do you think this would work with the sour cream flavour?\n-\nFANTASTIC! Even my mom who doesn‚Äôt like pudding loved it!\nI doubled the Berry sauce and it was perfect. I also didn‚Äôt have regular milk, so used half a cup of water to soften the gelatin.\n-\nMy family loves it.\nThe past few.times I have noticed it is getting a film on top after cooled. Is this because I forgot to let it cool 5 min before adding to the sour cream?\n-\nMy go to recipe. I made this with half and half and added an extra packet of gelatin. Turns out lighter and just as tasty. I also double this regularly.\n-\nHave made this multiple times , no fail ever with regular or lactose free dairy . Everyone loves it and asks for it.\n2 questions\nCan u double with no issues?\nSecond I have anxiety with directions that say ‚Ä¶ when steaming‚Ä¶. Would love an actual temperature to guide me\n-\nI will be making this again! So easy yet it‚Äôs a show stopper. Hubby really appreciated it and I got to feel like a Masterchef. üòâ\n-\nMy husband told me it‚Äôs the best dessert I‚Äôve ever made him! I made these for a dinner party and they were a huge hit.\n-\nHi, I want the top to have jello in it too, how much jello would I have to add?\n-\nThis is absolutely to die for. Delicious. I‚Äôve had panna cotta in the past but this turned out so much better! I think it‚Äôs the sour cream taste that I love, will be making again!\n-\nmade them last night they were amazing thank you i will have to make them again for the family dinner\n-\nBest Foodie in the world. All recipes are right on point. Being a Chef myself I love to follow Natasha‚Äôs Creativity and Passion for the Culinary World.\nThank you\n-\nI‚Äôve made it yesterday and they taste amazing, thank you so much for the recipe! I didn‚Äôt have lemon and fresh strawberries/raspberries so I‚Äôve used frozen strawberries and still tastes amazing! Next time I will follow your recipe exactly üòÅ thanks again! This recipe is 5 stars and 5 ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§\n-\nEasy recipe, great directions. Drizzled caramel on top followed by whipped cream and a little more drizzle. We both loved it.\n-\nI made this tonight, for Valentine‚Äôs day. Turned out great. I used raspberries for the sauce. I distributed the custard into 5 cups. I would double the berry ratio next time. I served it in wine glasses as well. It was well received. I might consider slightly more vanilla in the custard next time.\n-\nHey Natasha! What a fabulous recipe this is ‚Äì ‚Äì this is the third time I‚Äôve made it and it was just as super as the first two times. I wanted a light dessert for my book club menu of lasagna and caprese. Wow! Did this ever hit the spot! I served it in 4 ounce crystal wine glasses and it was not only wonderfully tasty, but looks so pretty with the raspberry sauce. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I used your fabulous lasagna recipe too!\n-\nFirst time making. Our friends admired how pretty it looked, but when they dug in, they raved about how delicious it was. l\nI love that it was so easy to make and tasted absolutely divine!\nThank you for sharing your recipe. can‚Äôt wait to try more of them\n-\nHi Natasha! If I am using gelatin sheets, where the gelatin sheets will soak in water (like a plastic film soak in cold water resulting in jelly texture, should I use one sheet or 2 sheets?\n-\nHey Natasha, how far ahead can I make this? Would 4 days before event be too much? If I put the berry sauce right before serving would it be ok?\n-\nI used yogurt instead of the sour cream. I introduced my grandson to this dessert a few weeks ago. When I said I was making it for guests this week he asked me to make some for him too. He over responds to sugar so I use organic sugar which responds slower and cut out the additional Tbsp. Perfect.\n-\nI made these for the first time, and everyone loved them. The second time I did them, I had to double the portion because 1 is not enough. TY\n-\nMade this for first time..was super easy..delicious..and turned out exactly as your pic..ty\n-\nMade this for a dinner club gathering. It was a hit! Light, silky and so easy to make- it‚Äôs my new ‚Äúgo to‚Äù dessert.\n-\nThis panna cotta recipe is superb. Very easy to follow and the result is superbly silky. I used 2% milk and 35% whipping cream and it works. I just leave our the 1Tbsp of sugar and the sweetness is perfect. I made the sauce with strawberries and used an immersion blender to blend the syrup before adding the last cup of berries. Love this! Will definitely be one of my go-to desserts from now on. Thank you Natasha for sharing this.\n-\nHi\nI am from Australia can you advise what granulated sugar is (is this just normal white sugar)\n-\nI have a question about the unflavored gelatin, Your recipe calls for 2.5 tsp which equals 1 packet. However, when I used the recipe multiplier for 18 servings, it still only states 1 packet, but does say 7.5 tsp. Is it still only 1 packet or should it read 3 packets? I am making it today and do not want to make it incorrectly.\n-\n-\nMade the recipe and tripled the recipe to make 40 3 oz mini shooters. Topped them with macerated strawberries and they were a big hit at a party.\nGreat recipe just as it is. I just followed the original recipe and tripled it on my own. Thank you so much.\n-\n-\n-\nI loved the berry sauce, but didn‚Äôt care for the change in taste that the sour cream gave.\n-\nHow long can I store this dessert?\nI made it today but I‚Äôd like to have it just on Sunday. My husband tried it already and loved it.\n-\nI made this dessert today for a lunch gathering and it was super delicious as well as easy. The berry topping was perfect as it cut through the richness of the Panna cotta itself. I was ‚Äòawarded‚Äô‚Äô 110% (üòä) for presentation as I did exactly the same as you. Thank you, Natasha for yet another brilliant recipe.\n-\nThis desert is to die for and so easy to make. Perfect dinner party desert. Your guests will be very impressed.\n-\nLove this recipe,my niece asked me to make it ,honestly I never heard of it ,but I found this recipe and that was it ,the only one I‚Äôll make\n-\n-\nMaking a double batch tonight for tomorrow,question can I double this ? I made them separately\n-\n-\n-\nMade this with canned lychee and it was excellent, restaurant quality\n-\nI have been making panna cotta for 20 years. This is the best and easiest recipe. The tang of the sour cream makes it special. I‚Äôve used real vanilla bean and the tiny seeds makes it just a cut above. Everyone loves it!\n-\nCan I just say this is the best panna cotta or dessert in general I have ever had despite this being the first time trying this dessert. It was soft, silky and creamy and everything you could ever ask for in a panna cotta. It wasn‚Äôt too sweet which is good and the flavour was amazing. I live in Australia so I only used 200g of sour cream because that was the closest tub to a cup and I only used 2tsp of gelatine. I made it for a family party and wow everyone was a big fan especially my dad who isn‚Äôt very fond of sweets\n-\nI made this for Easter for my family and everyone Loved it! They requested me to make more! Thank you! It‚Äôs so easy to make and so yummy!!! üòäüòçüòçüòç\n-\n-\nHello Natasha, I made this recipe many times and we love it. I was just wondering for the sauce, could I add gelatin to make it firm? And how much would I have to add?\n-\nLove this recipe! It is so rich and creamy, every spoonful is like a bit of heaven in your mouth. This is a big favorite around here with the entire family. I usually triple the recipe when I do make it, and cut down on the sugar, using between 1/3 and 1/2 of the amount called for. It‚Äôs amazing!!!\n-\nI tried the recipe as is. It tasted good but not great, and the texture was definitely wrong. Real Panna Cotta has a heavenly creaminess to it and too much gelatin gives it a cheap and fake texture.\nMy suggestion, cut 1/3 of the gelatin (2/3 of the package), add half a cup of cream, and DOUBLE, or TRIPLE the sugar.\nNow we are talkin‚Äô!!!!!!\n-\nNO NEED to double the sugar‚Ä¶ Just add 2 or 3 tablespoons for the extra cream.\n-\n-\n-\nHi Natasha,\nCan this receipe be made couple of days in advance.\nThanks\nSuzanne\n-\nDelicious! I followed the recipe without any modifications and our dinner guests said it was the best panna cotta they‚Äôve ever had. So easy to make too! Great recipe instructions.\n-\nHi\nI‚Äôm from India , here finding berries is hard what is the substitute for the berries sauce can I used berries crush . Or any other alternatives .\n-\nAmazing amazing recipe! Super easy to make and turns out perfect. My whole family absolutely loved the flavours! Natasha thankyou for this one üíó\n-\nI had Panna Cotta in Italian restaurant and wanted to try making it myself. I was skeptical at first because your recipe has sour cream and when I tried the warm product I didn‚Äôt really liked the taste, but this morning after leaving it in the fridge overnight it was very delicious ü§§\nI used oui yogurt jars, small and sturdy, perfect for your guests üôÇ\n-\nI made it yesterday and it was delicious. I substituted ¬º of sugar with monk fruit sugar for Panna cotta. Also substitute the sugar with sweetener for the sauce. Thank you for the great recipe and my family enjoyed it!\n-\nCan‚Äôt wait to make this for a galentines dinner. May I ask where you got your dessert glasses from?\n-\nPanna cotta means ‚Äúcooled cream‚Äù You dont need sour cream or milk at all.. Just cream. Ive made this version and got tired throwing away half eatin desserts(maybe recipie just needs more sugar idk). So I decided to make ths authentic simple panna cotta and everyone was fighting for it at my house.\n-\nHi Natasha! Can I use whipped cream instead of heavy whipping cream?\n-\n-\nThis recipe is sooo good, all of my friends also loved it. Thanks for sharing.\n-\n-\n-\nLove this recipe, soooo good! I didn‚Äôt see anywhere on your page of how many fl oz the whole recipe is (unless I missed it), but I thought I would share with others who decide to make this in smaller cups. Total makes 36oz. So I was able to make 9 cups each filled with 4oz of the panna cotta and it was the perfect size for a party dessert! Thanks again for this delicious recipe Natasha!\n-\nHi Natasha? Could I substitute the sour cream for greek yogurt? Would that be okay?\n-\nThis has to be absolutely the best thing I have ever made. I‚Äôve been cooking since I was a child and I am now 55 but for some reason panna cotta has always been my favorite dessert. This recipe is superb.\nAccidentally I did use two cups of sour cream in my first attempt and, while it was very good, it was quite rich. There was probably not enough sugar in that batch but it was still very good.\nIn a subsequent batch I added a little bit of orange extract and I used vanilla beans that I scored and scalded in the initial milk and gelatin mixture. It added a nice touch to have the flecks of vanilla bean in the final product. I also used a double boiler instead of putting the milk directly on the flame, adding everything to that before I poured it into the sour cream. It took a little bit more time and effort but for me it was worth it, as I tend to scald milk to burning.\nThe recipe is excellent as is but I did try a third time with two cups of sour cream (again) and I added a little bit extra sugar (about 3/4 of a cup) and that turned out exquisite as well. It is a very forgiving dish though it is important to make sure that the initial gelatin is softened in the milk and pay close attention not to burn the mixture.\nI could make and eat this every single day of my life. Thanks for the great recipes in your blog.\nDavid\n-\nHi, Natasha, can I use Agar Agar instead of Gelatine and in what proportion?\n-\nHi Natasha!\nThat‚Äôs look great!\nI do not have Whipping Cream in hands, can I use Heavy Cream instead?\nIf yes, should I use the same amount ‚Äì 2,5 cups?\nThanks\nLuba\n-\nMy daughter-in-law made this for me and it went straight to the top of my list. #1 Dessert!!!!\nI now have it in my file, and will make it often. Cant believe how easy it is.\nThank you!\n-\nHello Natasha,\nNatasha here also üòâ\nI wanted to ask about the fruit topping. It says 2 cups of fruits (1 cup raspberries & 1 cup strawberries) for the syrup‚Ä¶then in the video it says to put fresh berries and take it off heat‚Ä¶is that two more cups of strawberries/raspberries or its included in the two cups at the beginning? I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm making sense‚Ä¶hopefully you understand what I mean.\n-\n-\nThank you! It was soooooooo good!!! So rich, creamy, and so delicious üòã üòç üòä\n-\n-\n-\nNatasha hi!\nI‚Äôve made this recipe before and it‚Äôs delicious! I‚Äôve usually made it like the day of though. Do you think I can make the syrup/fruit portion ahead of time too and leave it in a pan and then spoon over right before serving? Hope that makes sense!\n-\nI love the original recipe! It‚Äôs always delicious! I was thinking to incorporate Yuzu into this recipe to give it a Japanese twist. Any suggestions on how I could add it? Was thinking yuzu extract but not sure how much.\nThank you!\n-\nBeautiful recipe‚Ä¶if using high quality ingredients this comes out pretty rich, but still light on the palate. Natasha, how far ahead of time can this recipe be made?\n-\nVegan: Silk Heavy Whipping Cream; for milk: .5 Silk Vanilla Creamer .5 Silk Half and Half (.5 Oatmilk/.5 Coconut milk); and tried both Forager Sour Cream (Cashew) and Tofutti (Tofu) Sour Cream both which were great. Also I doubled the vanilla and put far less sugar and added maple syrup. Comes out great everytime\n-\nVegan: Silk Heavy Whipping Cream; for milk: .5 Silk Vanilla Creamer .5 Silk Half and Half (.5 Oatmilk/.5 Coconut milk); and tried both Forager Sour Cream (Cashew) and Tofutti (Tofu) Sour Cream both which were great.

My husband is Sicilian and hasn‚Äôt had since he was a child he told me that reminded him of his grandma‚Äôs\n-\nMade this dessert a few times now and always amazing how simple it is make. It‚Äôs a crowd pleaser.\n-\nMade this tonight and followed the exact recipe‚Ä¶perfecto! So yummy huge hit in my house. Thank you Natashaüëè\n-\nThese taste amazing, y‚Äòall! Just made them for a dinner that I‚Äòm hosting tomorrow and I always make an extra to try because I have trust issues lol. If you follow the directions closely, you will have a 5 star dessert!\nThank you for this recipe, Natasha!\n-\nThank you so much, this recipe is perfect.\nAlso do you know if I can do similar topping with different berries, just make several options of panna cotta?",

    "text": "The focus of this year's spring labor negotiations is on whether the momentum of wage increases, which reached a high level in 2023, can be maintained. In an interview with the media, Keidanren Chairman Tokura expressed his intention to work to achieve better results than last year. In an interview with the media at the beginning of the year, Keidanren Chairman Tokura said, \"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm for the spring training are not inferior to last year's, so it is desirable that the outcomes and results are naturally higher,\" and expressed his intention to work to achieve better results than last year. In addition, he reiterated the importance of continuous wage increases, saying, \"A virtuous cycle of wages and prices will not occur unless we continue not only this year but also next year.\" On the other hand, Mr. Sina, Representative Secretary of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said in an interview with the media that raising the national average minimum wage to 2000,2000 yen should lead to the realization of structural wage increases. In addition, he said, \"If we aim for an economy where the minimum wage is , yen, the way we proceed will change, such as using digital technology more effectively,\" and expressed his recognition that companies will be required to respond on the premise of wage increases.",

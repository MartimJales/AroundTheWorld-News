    "text": "Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka says for the first time the annual visitor arrivals in Fiji will surpass one million in 2023 and that the tourism industry employs about 110,000 people.\nMr Rabuka said the biggest challenge was to meet a shortage of about 5000 rooms.\n“Investors see the opportunities here,” he said in his new year’s message.\n“Currently there are at least eight significant hotel and resort projects underway with more on the drawing board.\n“It’s been evident for a long time there is great scope for tourism to develop in new areas of the country.\n“We have already announced the World Bank has agreed to commit just over $440 million to unlock Vanua Levu’s potential.\n“This is of huge and positive importance for our second largest island and for Fiji. We’ll be keeping you informed about this.”\nHe said Investment Fiji reported a large number of planned, renovated and new projects.\nMr Rabuka said from his own experience he could not recall a time when the investment prospects looked this good.\n“Some of them are well underway,” he said.\n“They include real estate developments and apartments, a business park, six shopping malls, hardware industry expansion, office buildings, restaurants, agriculture, aviation, and a mining venture dedicated to responsible resource extraction.”\nMeanwhile, Mr Rabuka said the tourism industry — centerpiece of the economy — was also surging.\n“Current estimates indicate the industry employs about 110,000 people. “We expect that figure to grow when more rooms are available.”",

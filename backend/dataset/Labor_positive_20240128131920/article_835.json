    "text": "The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 91,000 Nebraska workers — 9.5% of Nebraska’s workforce — saw a wage increase when the state’s minimum wage went up on Jan. 1, 2024.​\nThe bump is the second in a series of annual increases voters approved in 2022.\nBallot Initiative 433 was an effort of Raise the Wage Nebraska, largely supported financially by labor unions and various progressive organizations.\nOn Jan. 1, 2023, the minimum wage went from $9 an hour to $10.50 an hour. It will increase to $13.50 on Jan. 1, 2025, and to $15 on Jan. 1, 2026.\nPeople are also reading… Man found dead in NW Lincoln lake after report of submerged car Fourth generation set to lead Lincoln's largest bank Lincoln man lied on food stamp application, defrauded government of more than $25K, officials say Grain elevator in the heart of Lincoln up for sale Minnesota All-American outside hitter Taylor Landfair transfers to Nebraska Lancaster County Sheriff to put six automatic license plate readers along I-80 Amie Just: Predicting 2024 for Nebraska Athletics — and beyond Driver violated red light in 70th Street and Nebraska Parkway crash, LPD says Ruling allows Nebraska employees to continue working remotely — for now These 4 moms, home in Waterloo for the holidays, always can ask a sister for baby advice Shooting suspect arrested in I-80 traffic stop, Nebraska State Patrol says LFR responds to fire at Lazlo's in south Lincoln Nebraska football reserve linebacker enters transfer portal Double blessings: Twin brothers welcome babies on same day in Lincoln Alvo couple welcomes first baby of 2024 in Lincoln Rebecca Firestone, executive director of Nebraska's Open Sky Policy Institute, said the gradual increases will help Nebraskans.\n\"Hardworking Nebraskans deserve an economy that respects their work and enables them to support their families and contribute to their communities,\" Firestone said.\nThe increase will help to reduce racial income disparity and provide low- and middle-income Nebraskans with much needed protection against inflation, she said.\nMark Whitehead, chair of the Lincoln Independent Business Association, said the change in the minimum wage is less important than market forces. A strong economy, he said, means a lower unemployment rate and produces higher pay.\n\"The Lincoln labor market has been well below effectively zero unemployment, as defined as 4% by most economists, for a significant number of years,\" he said. \"As such, for almost all service-level businesses, the minimum wage is irrelevant. The market dictates a much higher rate.\"\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\nMost businesses in the service sector are paying far more than $12 an hour, he said.\nThere may be some association members that are currently at $10.50 per hour, but he said they have developed strategies that drive value to their associates beyond the pay offered.\n\"Moving that rate to $12 per hour would have to get them to rethink their strategies on how they will continue to survive and hopefully thrive in this new environment,\" he said. ​\n​Nebraska is among 22 states that raised the minimum wage Jan. 1, according to Forbes Advisor.\nFor workers who are mainly compensated by tips, such as waitresses, waiters and bus persons, the Nebraska minimum hourly pay rate is $2.13 per hour. The sum of the $2.13 per hour plus all tips given to the individual must equal or exceed the required minimum wage for all hours worked.​​\nNeighboring states also set new minimums: Colorado, $14.42; Missouri, $12.30; South Dakota, $11.20.\nThe minimum wage in Iowa and Kansas is $7.25 an hour, same as the federal minimum, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The federal minimum wage has not increased since July 2009.\nAcross the country, an estimated 9.9 million workers will receive an increase, the Economic Policy Institute reported.\nIn total, workers will receive $6.95 billion in additional wages from state minimum wage increases, it said. In addition, 38 cities and counties will increase their minimum wages on Jan. 1 above their state’s wage floors, adding to the number of workers likely to see increased earnings, it said.\nAt the start of the new year, 22 states and 43 cities and counties are increasing the hourly minimum wage, benefiting nearly 10 million people. And that doesn't only affect workers at major fast food chains or retail outlets; it also includes people who work at small, locally-owned businesses.\nScripps News The Journal Star's most memorable photos of 2023",

    "text": "Australian opener Usman Khawaja has emphasized the need for cricket’s governing bodies to ensure that players receive adequate financial rewards to preserve the Test format. Khawaja underscored the importance of money reaching players’ pockets, warning that without appropriate compensation, players might opt for the lucrative T20 leagues to secure their families’ well-being. Advocating for increased transparency, Khawaja highlighted the allure of central contracts for top Australian players participating in Test cricket due to high match fees. However, he noted that this incentive might not be as prevalent in other nations, leading players to favour playing in T20 leagues where financial rewards are more substantial.

Acknowledging the financial disparities among nations, Khawaja suggested that the challenge lies in providing adequate incentives for players from other countries to prioritize international and Test cricket. He urged cricket boards worldwide to be transparent in determining the best compensation structures for players. Former Australian captain Steve Waugh had previously advocated for a universal match fee for all Test players to address earnings disparities. Khawaja echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the necessity for a collective effort to incentivize players globally and maintain the significance of Test cricket in the cricketing landscape.",

    "text": "The Minister of Energy and Mining, Saša Mujović, made it possible for the workers of the EPCG Nikšić Steel Plant to be paid winter pay, as is the practice for employees of the Electric Power Industry of Montenegro, the Ministry of Energy and Mining announced. \"Obligations to employees must be settled until a strategic partner is found and in communication with the company's trade union,\" Mujović said. The Ministry said that on December 11, the parent company Elektroprivreda Crne Gore (EPCG) announced a public invitation to lease production facilities in its daughter company - Željezara to interested investors. \"Those interested are given the opportunity to apply until January 25 of the following year. Until a credible partner enters the company, the obligations to the employees remain with the active involvement of the Ministry of Energy and Mining, which is in contact with all interested companies with broad diplomatic activity to find investors which will ensure investments and engagement of as many workers as possible, as well as expanding the business portfolio. To this end, Minister Mujović is in constant communication with the Electric Power Company of Montenegro as well as the Union of Railway Workers, in order to find the best solutions for problems in the transition period, such as is the issue of salary and winter pay,\" said the Ministry of Energy and Mining.

    "text": "Public sector workers in the Australian Capital Territory could soon be enjoying a four-day work week as the government joins private companies trialling the switch. The ACT under Chief Minister Andrew Barr has committed to establishing a working group from 2024 that will spearhead a shift to a three-day weekend with employees keeping their normal pay provided that their productivity remains the same. Some private companies in Australia are already testing the waters with Bunnings earlier this year telling its 40,000 employees they could condense their weeks and Medibank announcing in October they would let 250 staff try it for six months. While the pilot program will only involve government workers, Mr Barr has said if it was successful it could have a wider effect on all businesses in the ACT. 'My view is if we're going to do this, it's for everyone,' Mr Barr said. 'If we're fair dinkum about discussions for four days, then it needs to be four days across the [entire] system. 'We can't have our cake and eat it too.' The ACT government will test four-day work weeks for its employees with chief minister Andrew Barr (pictured) saying it could spread to the whole economy The ACT government confirmed the four-day work week trial in response to a September report from the Standing Committee on Economy and Gender and Economic Equality. The committee was investigating which model of a shorter work week would be most successful. Options such as a 'compressed' model in which workers do the normal 40 hours over four longer days, a 'reduction' model in which hours are reduced but productivity is expected to be increased, and a 'hybrid' model were all on the table. The committee recommended the reduction model with 'a shift to a four-day work week being considered full time employment' and acknowledging that would bring with it widespread 'societal repercussions'. Private companies are already testing the waters with both Medibank and Bunnings allowing workers to do four-day weeks to test their productivity While it has agreed to the trial the ACT government said it was still wary of the challenges. 'A trial within the ACTPS [ACT Public Service] will test the reduction model of the four-day work week where there is no loss of pay or conditions for ACTPS employees,' the ACT government said in a statement. 'While productivity may increase, it may not increase sufficiently or with enough longevity to fund the model in the longer term,' the statement continued. 'Further, staffing in many frontline areas will most likely have to increase to ensure adequate roster cover and ensure service delivery is maintained.'",

    "text": "Neeraj Chadawar, Head of Quant Strategy, Axis Securities: “We believe that in 2024, the entire PSU space will continue to ride its momentum. Right now the entire PSU space is having a 14% market cap as compared to the total market cap of the market which was earlier seen as 8% only and the historical average was 23%. So there is enough headroom available for PSU stock to go further from the current level also. There is a huge opportunity available to improve their market cap. Given the scenario of stable government and given the scenario of the capex led growth, we firmly believe that the entire PSU banking space is on the cusp of the cycle and there is a good amount of re-rating possible which was not earlier the case.” The growth opportunity or the addressable market when it comes to the manufacturing space is huge but don’t you think that the runup that we have seen in all the stocks, the valuations are quite expensive at this moment? Is it a good entry point for any new investor currently?Neeraj Chadawar: We are on the cusp of the big manufacturing cycle. The first leg of rally we are already seeing in the first leg of stock. Now we are identifying the stocks which are contributing to the ancillary demand of the manufacturing cycle. One stock which we identified is Amber Enterprises. Amber Enterprises has rightly introduced their product into fastest growing demand in the case of railway and the mobility space. Now they are contributing and making gang wagons and doors for the newly introduced Vande Bharat trainSo a company has also pointed out that this space is growing and they will double their expected revenue in next year which we believe that this space is very margin accretive and this will drive the EBITDA for the company in next two to three years. Based on this demand and the growth trajectory which they are seeing, we believe that this stock is very reasonably valued at this juncture and one can make a good entry point in Amber Enterprises at the current juncture. We foresee a Rs 3,700 target price in the next one year. The next is Sansera Engineering. This is an auto ancillary company and in over a year this company has de-risked its portfolio which was earlier concentrated into IC engines. Now they have de-risked their portfolio and entered into the fastest growing segment of EV, aerospace and defence. So all these segments are contributing high margin segment and which brings us the visibility for next couple of years where they will improve their return ratios and based on the demand momentum, we firmly believe that return ratios for this company are likely to improve in upcoming quarters and based on that we foresee a good amount of EPS growth in next three years and that will attract the good EBITDA margin improvement and ROE improvement. We set the target of Rs. 1210 for Sansera Engineering. One can make an entry in this stock with a good amount of potential of almost 20% from the current level.SBI is also one of your picks for 2024. Now we do understand that SBI has been a key laggard in 2023 and fundamentals continue to remain positive hence it could be an addition to your 2024 picks but why not any pick from a private banking space? HDFC bank has also been a laggard in 2023, right?Neeraj Chadawar: We believe that in 2024, the entire PSU space will continue to ride its momentum. Right now the entire PSU space is having a 14% market cap as compared to the total market cap of the market which was earlier seen as 8% only and the historical average was 23%. So there is enough headroom available for PSU stock to go further from the current level also. There is a huge opportunity available to improve their market cap. Given the scenario of stable government and given the scenario of the capex led growth, we firmly believe that the entire PSU banking space is on the cusp of the cycle and there is a good amount of re-rating possible which was not earlier the case. So given the scenario of a stable asset quality trend improving return ratios, we are foreseeing SBI to have an ROE of 16% so that makes a good bet to make an entry into the entire PSU banking space and we are confident about the growth levers for SBI.In the case of JK Lakshmi, you are seeing an upside of around 14% but of late, the cement space entirely if you see has been lagging with lower demand, prices have been on a downside and also raw metal prices have been quite volatile. So what is it that you are seeing will change for the cement companies in 2024?Neeraj Chadawar: For cement companies, H2 is likely to be brighter as compared to H1. The entire cement space is likely to see EBITDA per ton improvement as compared to H1, especially related to JK Lakshmi Cement. JK Lakshmi cement has a subsidiary in Udaipur and they are ramping up their facilities starting from Q1 FY25 which will contribute to their volume growth given tThat we are seeing a good amount of demand which is reviving in the infrastructure space and that is ramping up the volume growth. The company is well targeting to improve their EBITDA per ton starting from Rs 700 at present to Rs 950-970 in the next couple of years. This cost optimization practice and improvement in the EBITDA per ton makes a case of good improvement in the margin and good improvement to make an entry into this cement space. So that is why we firmly believe that currently the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation and we set a target of Rs 1000 for this stock in the next one year.Cyient is one of your IT picks, now there could have been more value in largecaps also, don’t you think so?Neeraj Chadawar: IT could be the good sector rotation theme in 2024 and it is likely to benefit more from the US interest rate cut which is likely to start from May-June 2024. Cyient is especially placed into the ER&D space that is the engineering research and development space and that space is continuously growing. We have seen multiple companies are catering into ER&D space and their demand is continuously rising because the end users are from the multiple industries and Cyient is playing a very significant role in playing a technology partner with all those players. So we believe that this is the fastest growing space along with that the aerospace demand is also increasing so they are also catering to that demand. So we firmly believe that there is a good amount of doubling the profitability in the next three years being the good revenue continues for the next three years. We firmly believe that this is a good place one can look at. This is the fastest growing company currently having a market cap of 25,000. If the company sustains their growth momentum, it is likely to get a mark of a mid-cap company also after the SEBI classification. So we believe that is possible in the next six months. We firmly believe that even the growth trajectory in ER&D space, this stock is a good place for the momentum growth.",

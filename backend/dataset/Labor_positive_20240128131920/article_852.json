    "text": "DEAR READERS: According to a new survey from American Student Assistance and from Jobs for the Future, Gen Z youth are increasingly pursuing non-degree pathways to acquire skills that lead to quality jobs, and there is a growing appetite among employers to hire employees who have taken those pathways. It’s the time of year when high school seniors and their parents are making decisions about post-high school plans. How can they decide which path makes the most sense for them? “Students need to know that college isn’t the only path to success,” says Jean Eddy, CEO and president of American Student Assistance and author of a new book, “Crisis-Proofing Today’s Leaners: Reimagining Career Education to Prepare Kids for Tomorrow’s World.” “It’s become our country’s default, but non-degree pathways, like trades, industry-specific certifications and entrepreneurship, are also viable paths.” People are also reading… While the college-no-college decision is always a very personal one, industry pros offer some suggestions for those trying to make the decision that’s right for them. Consider the student’s personal strengths, learning style and career dreams. That advice comes from certified psychology expert and life coach Bayu Prihandito, founder at Life Architekture. “For instance, if a student thrives in hands-on environments, apprenticeships or vocational training can provide the practical experience that aligns with their skills,” Prihandito says. “On the other hand, college might be the path for those who can benefit from a structured academic environment and have career goals that do require a degree. It's not a one-size-fits-all; it's about where you see yourself growing the most, both professionally and personally.” Itay Malinski, CEO and founder of Aloha Digital, who has mentored many young professionals as they navigate their career paths, echoes Prihandito. “The key is to match their educational path with their career goals and learning style,” he says, noting that the rise of tech-based roles and the need for specialized skills are two things that have opened up non-degree pathways that didn’t exist a generation ago. “If they’re a problem solver who loves coding, for example, a coding boot camp might be a faster and more cost-effective way to launch their career than a four-year degree. On the other hand, if they are drawn to a field that requires a deep theoretical understanding, like law or medicine, college is likely the best choice. The key is to match their educational path with their career goals and learning style.” Ask yourself what you want to get out of a college experience. “Does the career path you hope to take require a degree? Do you enjoy academia and want a higher education? Or are you considering college because you don't know quite what you want?” says Agatha Relota Luczo, founder and chief creative officer of Furtuna Skin. “These are important questions to consider when trying to choose your post-high school path. Knowing what you want to get out of college can help you consider a degree in a different way. Then you'll have a deeper understanding of if higher education is worth it for you personally.” Find digital resources, skill-building opportunities and information that let you explore careers based on your interests and passions. It is important that those resources are available to everyone, Eddy stresses, because they enable students “to be well-positioned to navigate a path to postsecondary education and career success.” Some resources available from American Student Assistance include the Futurescape platform, job shadows, worksite visits, career fairs and “meet a professional” experiences. “These opportunities allow a young person to begin to uncover the wide variety of career possibilities in front of them and begin to think about what might align with their interests,” she says. ASA also offers EvolveMe, a platform that incentivizes students to build life skills, engage with mentors, build career networks and gain valuable experiences, she adds. Take advantage of early college and P-TECH (Pathways in Technology) opportunities in high school, when available. “These equip students to make informed, confident decisions to achieve their post-high school goals,” Eddy says. “Kids need to know all of their options. These programs allow students the opportunity to gain post-secondary education and training, and sometimes industry certification, prior to leaving high school.” Kathleen Furore is a Chicago-based writer and editor.

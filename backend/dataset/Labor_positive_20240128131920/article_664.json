    "text": "- \"I want to ensure workers that we are alert and we will not abandon them.\" - Further, the head of state proposed a deduction of House Levy from salaried Kenyans under the Finance Act 2023. Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU-K) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged employers to increase the salaries of their employees in 2024. Atwoli said the new year will not be the same as Kenyans have lost their purchasing power due to the poor economy, as it requires a lot of panel beating. \"I want to urge our employers to consider increasing the salaries of workers for the hard work Kenyans are trying to display; we must improve the working conditions of our workers,\" he said. He further added that as a responsible trade union in the continent and the world, the body will ensure the workers' double efforts to ensure they supplement the work being done. \"As we redouble our efforts, we need to be compensated; that is our policy. I want to ensure workers that we are alert and we will not abandon them.\" Additionally, Atwoli said the union will vigorously 'fight' for the rights of the workers in 2024 to ensure they are comfortable, even as the country experiences different dynamics. \"We must do something for our people.\" The country has experienced a skyrocketing cost of living, with increased taxes as most employee's salaries remained the same. President William Ruto's administration announced an increase in the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) deduction for employed Kenyans. Further, salaried Kenyans are still being deducted 1.5 per cent of their gross salary for the housing levy under the Finance Act 2023.",

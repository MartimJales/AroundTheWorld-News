    "text": "Nebraska’s minimum wage will increase from $10.50 an hour to $12 an hour on New Year’s Day. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that 91,000 Nebraska workers — 9.5% of Nebraska’s workforce — will see a wage increase when the state’s minimum wage goes up on Jan. 1, 2024. The bump is the second in a series of annual increases [voters approved](https://omaha.com/news/local/government-politics/nebraska-voter-id-minimum-wage-initiatives-heading-for-approval/article_2b2d28d4-5bb5-11ed-a94d-1fdf1ff1c183.html) in 2022. Ballot Initiative 433 was an effort of Raise the Wage Nebraska, largely supported financially by labor unions and various progressive organizations. On Jan. 1, 2023, the minimum wage went from $9 an hour to $10.50 an hour. It will increase to $13.50 on Jan. 1, 2025 and to $15 on Jan. 1, 2026. People are also reading… Rebecca Firestone, executive director of Nebraska’s Open Sky Policy Institute, said the gradual increases will help Nebraskans. “Hardworking Nebraskans deserve an economy that respects their work and enables them to support their families and contribute to their communities,” Firestone said. The increase will help to reduce racial income disparity and provide low- and middle-income Nebraskans with much needed protection against inflation, she said. Mark Whitehead, chair of the Lincoln Independent Business Association, said the change in the minimum wage is less important than market forces. A strong economy, he said, means a lower unemployment rate and produces higher pay. “The Lincoln labor market has been well below effectively zero unemployment, as defined as 4% by most economists, for a significant number of years,” he said. “As such, for almost all service-level businesses, the minimum wage is irrelevant. The market dictates a much higher rate.” Most businesses in the service sector are paying far more than $12 an hour, he said. There may be some association members that are currently at $10.50 per hour, but he said they have developed strategies that drive value to their associates beyond the pay offered. “Moving that rate to $12 per hour would have to get them to rethink their strategies on how they will continue to survive and hopefully thrive in this new environment,” he said. Nebraska is among 22 states raising the minimum wage Jan. 1, according to Forbes Advisor. For workers who are mainly compensated by tips, such as waitresses, waiters and bus persons, the Nebraska minimum hourly pay rate is $2.13 per hour. The sum of the $2.13 per hour plus all tips given to the individual must equal or exceed the required minimum wage for all hours worked. Neighboring states will also be setting new minimums: Colorado, $14.42; Missouri, $12.30; South Dakota, $11.20. The minimum wage in Iowa and Kansas is $7.25 an hour, same as the federal minimum, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The federal minimum wage has not increased since July 2009. Across the country, an estimated 9.9 million workers will receive an increase, the Economic Policy Institute reported. In total, workers will receive $6.95 billion in additional wages from state minimum wage increases, it said. In addition, 38 cities and counties will increase their minimum wages on Jan. 1 above their state’s wage floors, adding to the number of workers likely to see increased earnings, it said.

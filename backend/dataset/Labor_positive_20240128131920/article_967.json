    "text": "60 jobs saved as Purity Brewing Company bought out of administration [Jungmin Seo](https://www.thecaterer.com/authors/jungmin-seo) The new owner of Vinoteca and D&D London has bought Purity Brewing Company and Pure Craft Bars out of administration, saving all 60 staff jobs in the process. Investment firm Breal Capital has acquired Warwickshire-based Purity Brewing Company, which was founded in 2005 and is the parent company of Purecraft, which operates a bar and kitchen in Birmingham. Joint administrators Mike Denny and Mark Firmin of professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal Europe LLP sold both businesses to Breal, which has been on a hospitality acquisition spree since last year. The London-based firm bought Yorkshire's [Black Sheep Brewery](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/black-sheep-brewery-sold-london-investor) in May 2023, as well as London craft brewers Brick Brewery, [Brew by Numbers](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/brew-by-numbers-brewery-collapse-breal-capital) and wine bar [Vinoteca](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/vinoteca-administration-sold-wine-bar) in August. Breal also acquired [D&D London](https://www.thecaterer.com/news/dd-london-sale-restaurant-expansion) in October last year with private investment company Calveton in a deal that reportedly valued the restaurant group at around Â£60m, including debt. Mike Denny, managing director at Alvarez & Marsal, said: \"Like many operators in the hospitality sector, Purity Brewing and Purecraft have endured tough market conditions. Most recently, the impact of significant cost inflation coupled with reduced discretionary spend has placed significant strain on the companies. \"We're pleased to have preserved the future of both businesses and the Purity brand by delivering the sale to Breal Capital, safeguarding all 60 local jobs.\" Image Credit: Purecraft Bar and Kitchen / Facebook",

    "text": "Despite a stuttering economy and persistent labor shortages, Germany experienced a surge in the number of employed individuals last year, [as reported by Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/2023-waren-rund-45-9-millionen-menschen-in-deutschland-erwerbstaetig-a-fcbba15a-2ff5-4f9c-9c8c-28e6f6cad9cb). According to preliminary calculations by the Federal Statistical Office, an average of around 45.9 million people were employed—a record level since the reunification in 1990. This marks an increase of 0.7 percent or 333,000 individuals compared to the previous record year of 2022, even though Germany’s economy contracted, as reported by leading institutions. A key factor contributing to the employment growth in 2023 was the influx of foreign workers, as stated by the Statistical Office. Additionally, a higher labor force participation rate among the domestic population helped overcome the dampening effects of demographic changes on the labor market. Experts anticipate further growth with the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) expecting the number of employed individuals to surpass 46 million this year. By 2025, according to DIW, it could rise to 46.082 million. However, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) emphasizes that employment might soon reach its peak. The reason for this is given the aging potential workforce, despite expected above-average immigration. The service sectors accounted for the majority of new jobs with an increase of 295,000 individuals or 0.9 percent, reaching around 34.6 million. Substantial growth was observed in the Public Services, Education and the Health sector. Furthermore, in Trade, Transport and Hospitality. In the Manufacturing sector (excluding construction), the number of employed individuals saw a slight increase, while the Construction sector and Agriculture and Forestry recorded declines. The crucial factor for the overall positive trend was the rise in the number of employees by 363,000 or 0.9 percent to 42.1 million, primarily attributed to the positive development of social security-contributing employment. In contrast, the downward trend persisted among the self-employed, including assisting family members with a decrease of 30,000 to 3.9 million.",

    "text": "20 more jobs have been created in the north after the Lunch Box Restaurant re-opened its third re-defined cuisine in Labasa today. Local business owner Vinesh Dayal says due to the demand, they upgraded their restaurant from an 84-seater to a 175-seater that employs a total of 36 school leavers. Dayal says from the structural changes being made and the number of machines they have purchased, they have invested $400,000 into this project. He says with a total of 8 restaurants they own, all restaurants are under a subsidiary of VCORP Limited, including the Coffey Break at MHCC, Vualiku Hotel in Martintar, Nadi and operates the Northpole Hotel, Northpole Rentals and other companies in Labasa. He adds many people in Labasa loved the rendition of the restaurant, and they are also looking forward to re-defining their Coffey Shop at MHCC and expanding their business around the country. The local businessman also shares his view in regard to the changes needed to be made in Labasa Town. Stay tuned for the latest news on our radio stations",

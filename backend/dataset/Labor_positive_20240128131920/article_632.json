    "text": "Episodes\n20 hours ago\n[December 30 - The Day Mines Were Made Safer](/e/december-30-the-day-mines-were-made-safer-1703948071/)\n20 hours ago\n20 hours ago\nOn this day in labor history, the year was 1969.\nThat was the day President Richard Nixon signed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act into law.\nAt least three key events served as the impetus for the legislation.\nBeginning in the mid 60s, miners began staging numerous health and safety walkouts across the Appalachian coalfields.\nTheir working conditions were despicable.\nThen, in November 1968, 78 miners were killed in a methane and coal dust explosion at Consol Mine no. 9 in Farmington, West Virginia.\nMiners were outraged when UMW leader Tony Boyle provided cover for the company’s murderous negligence.\nThen, in January, thousands of miners rallied in West Virginia’s state capitol, along with the Black Lung Association and the Disabled Miners and Widows.\nThey demanded legislation controlling coal dust and compensating black lung victims.\nWhen the hearings dragged on, 30,000 miners walked out in a wildcat the next month, in what is referred to as the 1969 Black Lung Strike.\nBy March, the number would increase to 40,000.\nThe state law passed March 12. Fears of a nationwide health and safety wildcat strike prompted Congress to craft and pass the federal Act.\nAccording to historian Paul Nyden, “the West Virginia Black Lung strike was the longest political strike in modern U.S. labor history.”\nThe Act created the Mine Safety and Health Administration.\nIt mandated annual inspections and increased federal powers of enforcement.\nThe Coal Act also required monetary penalties for all violations, and established criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations.\nThe Act developed improved mandatory health and safety standards and provided compensation for miners disabled by Black Lung disease. Miners continue to fight for better conditions, enforcement and compensation today.",

    "text": "A Moor Row-based nuclear business’ employee has received an MBE for services to the industry and young people. Peter Buchan, managing director of shipping at Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS), joins many other recipients of the award from the king. Pete’s career spans over 32 years and in that time he has, according to NTS, ‘played a key role in the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority group’s international [business](/news/business/) and ensuring the world-wide safe transport and storage of nuclear materials from across the globe’. Mr Buchan said: “I was shocked when I received the letter and it took a while to sink in as I didn’t think I would be worthy of such an award. “It’s a privilege to work in this industry, and when I think back to joining as a graduate all those years ago, never did I think this would happen to me. “I’ve worked on some fantastic and challenging projects that have made a real difference to global nuclear safety and security, and for this to be recognised at the highest levels is such an honour.” A spokesperson from NTS said: “One project Pete led was to ensure the largest civilian move of plutonium powder and highly-enriched uranium was safely completed when it was shipped from Japan to the USA. “This transport operation was an important milestone in global efforts to secure nuclear materials, and reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. “The shipment was hailed by the then president of the United States, Barack Obama, as ‘the largest project in history to remove nuclear material from a country’ and acknowledged in letters of thanks from the US Department of Energy to the UK Government.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

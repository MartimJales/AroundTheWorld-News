This peak marked the stock’s highest level in the past 52 weeks. The rally was ignited by a significant investment move from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which subscribed to non-convertible redeemable preferential shares amounting to Rs 3,300 crore.\nThe preferential shares were issued to RIL at an attractive dividend rate of 9% through a private placement basis. Notably, these preferential shares hold the feature of being redeemable at par anytime within a maximum period of 20 years from the date of allotment.\nAlso Read\nOil jumps 1.5% in New Year after U.S. forces repel Houthis in Red Sea This investment announcement led to a surge in trading activity, with an impressive 11 crore shares changing hands on the exchanges. This volume is notably higher than the one-month daily traded average of 4 crore shares, underscoring the heightened investor interest in Alok Industries. Over the past month, the stock has also recorded a substantial 31 percent increase.\nReliance Industries, being a promoter in the textile manufacturing company, has a history of strategic involvement with Alok Industries. In 2020, RIL, in collaboration with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co, successfully acquired Alok Industries through bankruptcy proceedings. This acquisition was executed to recover the outstanding dues to creditors, solidifying RIL’s position in the textile sector.\nAlso Read SBI, ONGC, Sunteck Realty, Coal India Dalmia Bharat top picks for Motilal Oswal in 2024\nAs of the end of the September quarter, RIL held a substantial 40.01 percent stake in Alok Industries, while JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co owned a noteworthy 34.99 percent stake. This recent move by Reliance Industries not only highlights its ongoing commitment to Alok Industries but also positions the textile company for potential growth and strategic developments in the coming years.\nInvestors and industry observers are keenly watching how this infusion of funds and strategic support from Reliance Industries will impact the future trajectory of Alok Industries, as both entities continue to collaborate and navigate the dynamics of the textile sector.",

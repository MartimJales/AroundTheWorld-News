    "text": "The government wants to give you a job. In a bid to compete with global players, the UK’s strategy has emphasised certain professions over others, particularly those in maths, tech and finance. Whether encouraging workers in the arts to retrain in cyber, or Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s pledge to cap the number of “low-value” degrees, the government’s aim seems clear: get out of the arts and into the office. It’s estimated that one-third of us are unhappy with our jobs, according to data from job site Indeed. Mix that with a desire for slower, more traditional ways of living, you wonder if some of us would prefer our next job to be low-tech rather than high-tech. So what can be done for workers seeking something beyond the computer screen? We asked five heritage craft professionals on the risks and rewards of carving out your own path through traditional crafts, and for their advice on seeking out a job from the past. Rebecca Struthers–watchmaker and historian, Staffordshire I love making stuff. My love is getting my hands dirty. It’s such a pleasure to be able to come up with ideas and bring them to a reality. I love how diverse the subject is; it brings together so many disciplines. You get to be an engineer, a designer, an artist. It always keeps you on your toes. Istarted my training back in 2003 doing a diploma silversmith course. I dropped out of school halfway through my A levels and ran off to art school – that’s where I found watchmaking. It’s very hand-skill based, and I was lucky that the courses I did were very practical. None of the courses that I took exist today in the same form.",

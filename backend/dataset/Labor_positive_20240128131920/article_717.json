    "text": "Happy Sunday, Friends!\nThe last week of trading in the year was an eventful one for SPACs, which included two deals being announced, and an LOI being signed for a potential merger. Also, a company accelerated its plans to go public by announcing a potential merger next year, and a new SPAC debuted, targeting firms in the media and\nentertainment industry. Read on to find out about the latest about all things SPACs.\nSPAC Deals Announced\n$AIB is Taking PSI Group Public in $200 Million Deal\nHong-Kong-based PSI is an air freight forwarding specialist, that offers global logistics and supply chain services to a diverse range of clients, including postal operators and e-commerce merchants.\nEstablished in 1993, PSI operates globally through its subsidiaries, including Profit Sail Int’l Express Limited and Business Great Global Supply Chain.\nFor the first half of 2023, the company reported $67.1 million in revenue, marking a 36% increase from the previous year.\nAIB, after raising $86.25 million in an IPO in January, originally aimed to invest in fintech companies. The merger is expected to be finalized in early 2024, after which the merged entity will be listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\nVisiox Pharmaceuticals is Merging With $PWUP\nVisiox Pharmaceuticals is developing an FDA-approved drug and other late-stage clinical candidates for ocular diseases like glaucoma and post-surgical inflammation.\nThe company’s product OMLONTI is used to reduce intraocular pressure, and is set to launch in early 2024, along with PDP-716 in 2025, a treatment using TearAct technology to improve dosage frequency for glaucoma.\nSDN-037, another product targeting post-surgical inflammation with a mid-2025 launch, utilizes a unique micellar platform for effective treatment.\nThe transaction is anticipated to generate gross proceeds of up to $19 million from the cash held in the SPAC trust. The SPAC raised $287.5 million in its IPO in February 2022 and must complete a deal by May 2024. In July, PowerUp sold its sponsor stake to SRIRAMA Associates.\nPotential SPAC Deals\n$BHAC Signs LOI to Take Fuel Maker XCF Group Public\n-\nSPAC Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Corp has signed a letter of intent with XCF Global Capital, a New York company specializing in sustainable fuels, in a deal valuing the combined company at $1.75 billion.\nThe New York-based company with several North American facilities, produces renewable diesel and plans to expand into sustainable\naviation fuel and other biofuels.\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, and due diligence, and a definitive agreement will be announced subsequently.\nIn September, Focus Impact acquired the sponsor stake in Crixus BH3 Acquisition for $16,288.27, which included over 3.7 million shares of Class B stock and nearly 4.2 million private placement warrants. Crixus BH3 had previously raised $200 million in its IPO in October 2021, targeting businesses focused on real estate, construction, or infrastructure-related activities.\nDoubleDragon Wants to Finalise SPAC Deal by Q2 2024\n-\nInjap Sia’s DoubleDragon Corp., through its subsidiary Hotel101 Global, is considering merging with a SPAC by the first half of 2024 to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange, accelerating Hotel101’s global expansion.\nDoubleDragon had previously planned for a Nasdaq Initial Public Offering sometime in 2026. DoubleDragon has not yet determined the valuation for its planned merger, believing that it would depend on the market conditions and expansion speed.\nThe company’s management has highlighted Hotel101’s innovative and scalable business model as ideal for a NASDAQ listing, expecting its revenues to potentially extend across over 100 countries.\nHotel101, differing from short-term rental platforms, offers uniform, new-build 21-square meter units, ensuring consistency and addressing inventory concerns.\nHotel101 is launching its first international projects in Niseko, Japan; Madrid, Spain; and California, USA. The company’s expansion plans include entering markets in the\nuk, UAE, india, Thailand, and several other countries across the globe down the road.\nSPAC News\n$IROH Prices $61 Million Initial Public Offering\nThe company’s Class A ordinary shares, warrants, and rights are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “IROH,” “IROHW,” and “IROHR.” The SPAC plans to target the media and entertainment industry, primarily in the United States.\nIron Horse is headed by CEO Jose Antonio Bengochea, Chairman Brian Turner, CFO Jane Waxman, and COO William Caragol.\nEF Hutton is the sole book-running manager for the offering, with Brookline Capital Markets as co-manager, and the underwriter has a 45-day option to buy up to 900,000 additional units to cover any over-allotments.\nMeme of the Day\nEverything comes with a risk profile\nThe Headlines\nJapanese Fintech Minnadeooyasan-Hanbai to list in London via Deal with UK-Listed Bowen $BACA Secures $260M Share Purchase Agreement SPACs Stumble on Accounting Rules for Backup Financing Deals\nSource:\nSupply Chain Success\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

This face-to-face interaction is critical in forming lasting impressions, which can oftentimes differentiate candidates from their competition.”\nBeyond the personal connections made, job fairs offer countless advantages to both job seekers and employers. For potential employees, these events allow them to gather relevant information about employers.

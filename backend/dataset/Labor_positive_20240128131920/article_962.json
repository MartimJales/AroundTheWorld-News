    "text": "Brought to you by\nChild Base Ltd\nUp to 50 paid days leave off work in a year has staff at 44-day nurseries in the employee-owned Childbase Partnership celebrating an even better ‘work-life ‘ balance and another boost to workplace happiness.\nA ‘first’ in the Early Years Sector, the ‘Partnership Reward Days’ plan – based on hours worked in the previous three months – means full-timers could get up to five days extra paid leave in each quarter with pro-rata allocations for others.\nThis is in addition to their annual leave entitlement, which was extended last year, Long Service Reward Days and Bank holidays and gives colleagues the opportunity to sell a portion of their extra days if they would prefer a cash reward.\nCheering and applause greeted the announcement at the annual Virtual Roadshow event for over 2,300 employee-owners of Childbase Partnership – a UK ‘Best Company to Work for’ for 14 years – in day nurseries from Nottingham to Swindon.\nNursery Practitioner, Mariama Faal, said:\n“It is exciting to think what is possible with more free time and a brilliant way to support us in giving the best early years care and education to children and parents. As usual Childbase is going the extra mile to support us.”\nPractitioner Emma Kilsby said:\n“This is brilliant as time is precious. I am going to be a grandmother for the first-time next year. It will be lovely to have time to spend with my grandchild and help out.”\nEmma Rooney, Childbase Partnership Chief Executive said:\n“This is quite simply, the right thing to do for colleagues who continue to rise magnificently in these challenging times.”\nThe ‘extra leave’ initiative follows the £8.5 million Financial Support Plan to help colleagues meet cost of living challenges. This includes two meals a day in settings, fresh fruit and refreshments in staff rooms, and free feminine hygiene products in addition to ‘Perkbox’ access to discounted shopping and entertainment.\nJoin our team\nExtraordinary and rewarding careers working in Early Years\nCheck\nhere for latest vacancies.\nComments: Our rules\nWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

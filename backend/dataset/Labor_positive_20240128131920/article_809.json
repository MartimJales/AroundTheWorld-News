    "text": "New Jersey’s minimum wage will increase to $15.13 an hour for hourly workers Monday, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development said. The increase will affect about 350,000 hourly workers in the state, although non-hourly employees can see indirect benefits from the statewide increase, the department said Wednesday in a news release. “Raising and aggressively enforcing the minimum wage signals to employers and workers alike that New Jersey values its workforce,” said Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo. “While our department’s workforce efforts try to ensure workers receiving minimum wage are only doing so for a small part of their career, this is a proud moment for New Jersey as we become one of the few states with a minimum wage above $15 an hour that will continue to be adjusted each year for inflation.” The Labor Department sets the minimum wage for the upcoming year using either the rate specified in the law or a calculation based on the consumer price index, whichever is higher. People are also reading… Under the law, some employers, like seasonal businesses and those who have six or fewer employees, have until 2026 to pay their workers at least $15 an hour. Those employees’ wages will go from $12.93 an hour to $13.73 an hour Monday. Agricultural workers guided by a separate timetable have until 2027 to reach the $15-an-hour minimum wage. But farm workers who work hourly or piece-rate wages will see their minimum wages go up 80 cents from $12.01, and direct staff in long-term care facilities will see their minimum wage go up a dollar to $18.13 an hour. “Raising the minimum wage has been a top priority of mine since day one,” said Gov. Phil Murphy. “There is no doubt that inflation has had an impact on every New Jerseyan. Now that we are close to surpassing the $15 per hour milestone, it’s important that we continue to ensure that everyone working in New Jersey has access to a livable wage.” Contact Selena Vazquez: 609-272-7225",

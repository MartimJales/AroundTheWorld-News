    "text": "Jade Rogers works four days a week but gets paid for five, as part of a program aimed at helping parents return to work after having children.\nIt’s one of a range of return-to-work policies offered by her employer Deloitte, and reflects a broader trend across corporate Australia in which companies are not only offering more generous amounts of paid parental leave, but also providing greater support and flexibility to parents once they have returned to work.\nDeloitte senior manager Jade Rogers at home with son Cassian. Alex Ellinghausen\n“That for me was a game changer,” Ms Rogers said of being able to work four days a week on full pay.\n“If that policy wasn’t in place, I wouldn’t have come back to work after 10 months … [I would have taken] 12 months or potentially longer.”\nAs part of the policy, Deloitte pays new parents working three or four days a week an extra day a week, and those working less than three days a week an extra half-day a week, for their first 12 months back.\nAdvertisement The professional services firm also offers 18 weeks of paid parental leave to all parents regardless of their gender, and relieves returning parents from their financial KPIs for a year.\nGrouped under the banner “making work work for families”, the package of policies ensured Deloitte was unofficially named by Parents at Work as one of the most family-friendly employers in Australia last year.\nThe workplace advisory group, which launched the Family Friendly Workplace certification for Australian organisations with UNICEF Australia in 2021 , also gave special mention to private health insurer Medibank, law firm Gadens, wine and spirits maker Pernod-Ricard, property group GPT and the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (ACFA) for introducing particularly family-friendly workplace policies.\nAustralia’s family-friendly workplaces Pernod-Ricard was celebrated for its commitment to flexible working and for its menopause policy, which aims to reduce the stigma of discussing menopause at work by connecting employees to support and resources via a Menopause Hub. Resources included educational case studies, possible conversation starters for leaders, and a list of Menopause Champions throughout the business who were available for one-to-one conversations and guidance.\nMedibank received a special mention for launching a six-month trial of a four-day working week in October , on the basis that this should make it easier for parents to balance their work and caring commitments.\nAdvertisement Gadens was congratulated for offering 30 weeks of paid parental leave without making a distinction between primary and secondary carers. The law firm also lets returning lawyers work four days a week on full pay, and gives them temporary budget relief for their first month back.\nGPT was lauded for offering a childcare allowance of up to $10,000 in addition to 22 weeks of paid parental leave for both parents. And the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which offers 18 weeks of paid parental leave for both parents, made the list after introducing a policy that encourages all employees to finish work at 2pm on Wednesdays.\nAFCA said its Take 3 policy, which is offered to staff on rotational basis to ensure there is no interruption to customer service, was introduced to help employees “recharge and focus on what is important to them, and results in greater productivity during the rest of the week”.\nA champion of workplace flexibility, AFCA’s chief operating officer, Justin Untersteiner, has worked four days a week for the past three years to spend more time with his children.\n“AFCA has a very firm view that if we offer flexibility, we can and do attract the best talent. Workplace flexibility is a major drawcard, and it really works in our favour,” Mr Untersteiner said.\nParents at Work chief executive Emma Walsh said companies with the most progressive workplace policies regularly solicited feedback from their employees to help identify and remove the main barriers preventing parents from fully contributing to the workplace.\nAdvertisement “That’s the thing that really makes the big difference,” Ms Walsh said.\nShe told The Australian Financial Review that in some ways it was easy to announce a generous paid parental leave scheme, but it was quite another “to make sure that people are supported back to work with a gradual return and with relief from particular targets they need to meet”.\nWorkplace Gender Equality Agency chief executive Mary Wooldridge agreed, adding that companies with comprehensive return-to-work policies would find it easier to retain staff over time.\n“Parental leave is really where it starts – not where it finishes – in relation to supporting employees when they have a family,” Ms Wooldridge said.\nWGEA data shows that 63 per cent of companies with 100 or more employees now offer some form of paid parental leave, in addition to the taxpayer-funded scheme , up from 49 per cent in 2018-2019.\nAdvertisement At Deloitte, Ms Rogers said being able to work four days a week on full pay meant she could save money on childcare and spend more time with her son without needing to hit the brakes on her career.\nIt is a schedule she is keen to stick with, after being promoted to senior manager in December while working part-time.\n“[It strikes] that balance between working and spending time with my little boy,” she said. “And I feel like I genuinely can progress my career over the next few years as well.”\ncorrection — An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Australian Financial Complaints Authority encourages staff to finish work at 3pm on Wednesdays. AFCA actually encourages staff to finish at 2pm.\nEuan Black is a work and careers reporter at The Australian Financial Review.

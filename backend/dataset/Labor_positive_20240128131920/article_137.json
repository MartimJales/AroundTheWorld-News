    "text": "Governor Dauda Lawal of Zamfara State has authorised the payment of “13th-month salaries” to both state and local government workers as part of a welfare package for citizens. The Head of Service, Ahmed Liman, conveyed this directive in a circular issued in Gusau on Friday, as disclosed to the public. In a statement provided to journalists on Friday, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Sulaiman Idris, highlighted this notable move as the first of its kind in the state’s history. Idris stated that this decision aligns with the state government’s dedication to the welfare of workers and aims to inspire enhanced performance among the workforce. “Today, Governor Dauda Lawal has approved the payment of end-of-year bonuses to public and civil servants in the state. This gesture is intended to elevate the workers’ spirits and offer them financial support during the holiday season. “This action exemplifies Governor Lawal’s commitment to implementing policies that improve working conditions, raise salaries, and create opportunities for career advancement for government workers. “The disbursement of the 13th-month salary is just one among several initiatives geared towards empowering workers and fostering economic growth in the state.” (NAN)",

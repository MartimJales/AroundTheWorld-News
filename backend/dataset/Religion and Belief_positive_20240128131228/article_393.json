The eagerly anticipated book launch is scheduled for December 31 at the prestigious auditorium of Akashvani Bhawan, where eminent personalities from various fields will grace the event. Notable among them will be the distinguished Governor of Kerala, Arif Mohammad Khan, known for his commitment to fostering inclusivity and dialogue. The event will be presided over by Dr. Indresh Kumar, the Executive President of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), adding a prominent voice to the discussion on the shared heritage of diverse communities in India. Govind Dev Giri, the Treasurer of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra in Ayodhya, and former Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan will also be in attendance, lending their insights to the enriching dialogue. Dr Indresh Kumar, a senior member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has played a pivotal role in inspiring this initiative, which aims to open avenues for understanding and collaboration between the RSS and the Muslim community. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan's presence as the chief guest adds significance to the event, reflecting the spirit of inclusivity that the book endeavours to promote.

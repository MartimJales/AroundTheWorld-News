    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / December 29, 2023 / LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / December 29, 2023 / One of the top faith-based film stars in the world - Kevin Sorbo - plays lead Pastor Lynbrook in the highly-anticipated ‘The Firing Squad' film that hits theaters nationwide in August 2024. The film is based on the true story of three Christians who faced execution by firing squad in a third world country. Epoch Times along with Epoch Studios is helping release the film to 2,500 theaters across the U.S. and the world in August 2024. \"So happy to finally get to work with Kevin,\" says Director Tim Chey. \"He's been a long-time friend of mine and God really orchestrated Kevin being in the film.\" Soro has starred ‘God's Not Dead' and ‘Let There Be Light' which were both box office successes. \"Kevin is just a stand-up guy for Jesus and America,\" continues Chey. \"He's been blacklisted by many Hollywood companies for his beliefs which is unfortunate.\" ‘The Firing Squad' also stars Cuba Gooding, Jr., James Barrington, Madeline Anderson, Eric Roberts, Edmund Kwan, et al. At early advanced screenings, the film has brought many to tears and many closer to Christ. \"It might be the most evangelical, hard-core Christian film ever made,\" said a spokesperson for VGC Studios. \"All glory and honor to the Lord.\" ‘The Firing Squad' In Theaters August 2024 About VGC Productions, RiverRain Productions, and Rock Studios RiverRain Productions, VGC Studios, and Rock Studios are one of the top faith-based film studios in the U.S. of over 16 feature films. \"THE FIRING SQUAD opens nationwide in theaters in August 2024.

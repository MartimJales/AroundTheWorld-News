Our journal is now more than thirteen years old. Perhaps you have traveled with us since that day in 2010 when we embarked on our mission is to preserve the transcendentals, the “permanent things” that constitute the glory of Western Civilization. Or perhaps you joined us mid-voyage in our fight for that which sustains us: virtue, law and order, truth, beauty, and goodness. Maybe you have just climbed aboard as a reader recently and have newly discovered our reasoned, reflective essays on issues of faith and culture, imagination and liberal learning, economics and politics, written by some great minds of both the present and the past. No matter how far and how long you have journeyed with us, we are grateful for your fellowship, and we raise a toast to you, recalling the words of William Cullen Bryant’s “A Song for New Year’s Eve”: Even while we sing, he smiles his last, And leaves our sphere behind.

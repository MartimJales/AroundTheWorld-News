    "text": "(Minghui.org) The recent 2023 Singapore Falun Dafa Experience Sharing Conference, held on December 25, inspired practitioners from Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the United States. They said they learned from each other and saw how to do better in cultivation. Among 18 practitioners who spoke during the conference, some shared miraculous experiences after they began to practice Falun Dafa, some described how they looked within and followed the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance in their daily lives, and some discussed the importance of overcoming fear during the pandemic to tell people the facts about Falun Dafa and the persecution in China.

Chronic Insomnia Disappears Overnight Victor is an Internet consultant who specializes in security. A coworker suggested he watch the videos of lectures given by Master Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Dafa. Victor said he was really moved by the lectures. His mind was broadened, and he realized that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) news reports about Falun Dafa were false and defamatory. The insomnia that bothered him for years disappeared overnight, and he also experienced numerous phenomena described in [Zhuan Falun], the main book of Falun Dafa, including opening the celestial eye, guanding (initiation ritual), and the heavenly circuit. As a father of two teenagers, Victor is deeply aware of how dangerous the Internet is. Due to bad influences on the Internet, many people have abandoned traditional values and are led astray. The launching of Gan Jing World, an Internet platform that promotes traditional values, gave him hope. With enhanced privacy protection and non-addictive algorithms, this media platform is family-oriented and it contains no violence, no crime, no pornography, or other harmful content. It benefits people in many ways, such as carrying Shen Yun Creations, information about Falun Dafa, and presenting other content with traditional values. Victor participated in the promotion of Gan Jing World and launched his own channel. During the process, he felt the same urgency to awaken sentient beings that he had during his initial years of obtaining the [Fa]. “During my sleep, I could feel myself elevating again, which I had not experienced for a long time,” he explained. Finding One’s True Self Eva recalled her joy when she found Falun Dafa seven months ago. “I felt like I was reborn,” she said. “The feeling was so real, as if I had been sleeping for thousands of years or millions of years.” Eva read “How Humankind Came To Be” and, “Why the Creator Seeks to Save All Life” many times. When she read these two articles written by Master Li, Eva said the word “Creator” touched her a lot. “I was awakened. It was a feeling of freedom and liberation after the restraint on my heart was removed. I found my true self.” Eva said she was filled with joy and determination—she found Falun Dafa in this lifetime. Whenever she has time, Eva reads Falun Dafa books and listens to Master Li’s audio lectures. This includes while waiting for meals, waiting for or riding the bus, or during breaks at work. She also joins other practitioners for group study and said she’s learned a lot from that. In the past, Eva often had a feeling of being empty and feelings of loss. But now her life is productive and happy. Noticing these positive changes in Eva and the harmonious atmosphere at home, her family is very supportive of her practice, and they are planning to see a Shen Yun performance. Hosting a Self-Media Channel After COVID emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the infection quickly spread to the entire world. Gary immediately realized that the CCP covered up the truth and was deceiving the world again. To tell people what was really going on, Gary started his own media channel and shared some video clips from China. But as more and more YouTube videos were labeled with yellow icons, Gary realized this was not enough to reach viewers and save people. So he began producing his own videos, which not only engaged viewers better, but also helped spread the facts effectively. Making videos from scratch is not easy and it was painful to see the extremely low number of subscribers. Just as Gary was about to give up, one news report boosted his subscribers to over 100. It later reached over 10,000, and then 100,000 in a few months. After some time, it gradually climbed to 200,000. The work is tedious, from collecting news materials, writing scripts, filming, editing, and adding captions, to uploading videos, publishing them, and responding to viewers’ comments. In addition, Gary had to perform technical analysis on the videos, improve them, and promote them on various social media platforms. The challenges were not limited to the demanding workload. “Running a self-media channel is also a process of improving [xinxing],” Gary said. “Whether one can remain calm in front of attacking remarks, and whether one can remain undisturbed facing humiliation and slander, these were all tests for me.” Four years have passed and Gary is very thankful that Falun Dafa and Master gave him wisdom so he can produce more videos. As a Dafa practitioner living in the Fa-rectification period, he was able to let go of fear and continue moving forward while improving himself. Delivering The Epoch Times Shen has delivered The Epoch Times newspaper for 18 years. Since late 2020, she and other practitioners have been trying to sell the newspaper in stores, news stands, and supermarkets. It has not been an easy process. Some news stand staff members gave her a hard time and some cashiers said sarcastic words. Even practitioners had different opinions and some said people nowadays prefer reading the news on their cell phones or watching videos instead of buying newspapers. When she failed to see results, Shen asked herself if she should continue. She reminded herself how important the newspaper is and decided to go out as usual. In the process, Shen also witnessed many miracles. One day it was raining but the rain stopped when she arrived where she was promoting the paper. As soon as she left, however, the rain started again. Shen is grateful for Master’s compassion. She said it is important to lay a good foundation by selling the newspapers in locations across Singapore. She believes that this will not only help people from China learn the facts, it’s also an effective tool to promote Shen Yun, introduce Gan Jing World, and host health forums and food exhibitions, to reach more people. Inspired to Remain Diligent Many practitioners said they learned a lot from the conference. Dinh from Vietnam said he started practicing Falun Dafa in Singapore. He commented, “Participating in the Fa conference is a precious opportunity and I’ve benefited a lot. The harmonious and compassionate energy field at the conference brought me to tears and moved me numerous times.” He was touched that practitioners in China remain diligent even after more than 20 years of persecution. He said one practitioner talked about a fundamental attachment he had when he started to practice—the desire to leave the Three Realms and avoid suffering. Dinh said he also had a similar attachment. “It made some of my [truth-clarification] projects suffer a bit. This is a dangerous attachment. This conference helped me see a gap in my cultivation and I need to move forward more diligently,” he added. “When I listen to fellow practitioners’ sharing, I feel some of my attachments and bad substances being pushed out. The Fa conference helps me be more steadfast in my cultivation and will help me maintain a pure heart on the next steps of my journey.” One couple who started to practice three months ago were also very thankful for the conference. Wife Meixin said that practitioners’ stories helped her look within and behave according to the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. Husband Yao said cultivation practice is indeed serious. “I always remind myself to eliminate bad attachments including fear. My wife and I encourage each other to cultivate well and participate in Falun Dafa projects,” he said. Geoff from the United States said he appreciated the conference very much. “I find the conference very useful and inspiring,” he shared. He said that every speaker’s sharing was very inspiring in different ways. Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "You went from being a roadside computer operator to a social media preacher. Did you see it coming? No, I didn’t see it coming at all. My late father was a pastor and I knew as a child that I had the call of God upon my life, but I was running away from it. But, being one that now preaches on social media, it is something I never saw coming at all. Growing up, I loved the things of the Lord, but along the line, I was carried away by the things of the world. It became tiring and I backslid. But, God corrected me. How did the call come for you? The call has always been there but when I knew that I had no choice but to pick the call of God upon my life was when I had an encounter with Jesus at a friend’s birthday party. That night, I encountered Jesus and that was how my life changed. Jesus came for me by himself and dragged me out of sin. How has the journey been so far? The journey, humanly speaking, is not easy but God has been helping me. He promised never to leave me and he has not left me. When did you know you could put your messages out on social media platforms? I have always had a passion for tech and computers, and I understood before now how the social space worked. So, I knew I could reach out to a large number of people, especially when my video went viral and a lot of people knew me. A lot of people also contacted me. I saw a goldmine in social media and I started recording and posting my messages online. Have you started monetising your content? I haven’t started monetising my content yet. You studied Electrical and Electronics and worked as a graphic designer. Do you miss your job? I still work as a graphic designer but not full-time. Most of my church graphics are made by me. When I am free, I can work for other people but I am not in a rush at all. What are some of the challenges of being a popular social media preacher? The only challenge is that I have to be more disciplined. I cannot do what other people are doing. I am very careful about the content I churn out on social media. This time, I am more like a positive influence on people and I am very careful with the kind of things I do. What are some of the things you can no longer do anymore as a result of your new status? There are some places I can no longer go to because I can’t just be seen there no matter my excuse for being there. I am very careful of the people I mingle with. As a single young man, how do you handle female admirers? It is not really easy handling female admirers but it takes discipline. My mentor always tells me that there are many errors some fathers would not have made if only they were disciplined. So, I try as much as possible to set boundaries so that I don’t fall victim. It is not easy handling them at all because they come in different ways and formats, but the grace of God has been there for me. What doors has stardom opened for you? It has made the message that Jesus Christ gave to me reach a very large audience, and it would not have been possible if I were a popular figure. By the grace of God, I have been able to connect with a lot of the preachers I look up to. It is what gave my ministry a start. When that video went viral, it redefined my ministry and I now knew that I was sent for the youth and teenagers, and showing them the way of God.",

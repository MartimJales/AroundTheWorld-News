    "text": "Amritsar (Punjab), Dec 29 (PTI) The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Friday said schoolchildren playing the roles of Sahibzadas Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh in plays during 'Veer Bal Diwas' events was against Sikh principles and traditions.\nThe Centre announced last year that December 26 would be observed as 'Veer Bal Diwas' to mark the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's younger sons and various events were organised on the occasion this year.\nAlso Read |\nIndia’s Remarkable Strides in 2023: A Year of Achievements Across Multiple Fronts.\nIn a statement, the SGPC said it has sought an explanation from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) along with the Ministries of Education, Culture and Minority Affairs of Government of India in the matter.\nAccording to the statement, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said that \"any such anti-Sikh act cannot be accepted\".\nAlso Read |\nYear Ender 2023: From Turkey-Syria Earthquake to Israel-Hamas War and Russia’s Failed Moon Mission, Here Are Top Nine Global Events of The Year.\nDhami said that any act against Sikh principles, customs, traditions and values hurts the Sikh sentiments and pointed out that objections are coming from the Sikh community about the acts of playing roles of the 'Sahibzadas' in physical form \"under the instructions of the central government regarding 'Veer Bal Diwas' in educational institutions in various states\".\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

    "text": "NORWICH — The Vatican recently issued a declaration that allows Catholic priests to deliver blessings to same-sex couples. It has been a welcome change to some Upper Valley residents. The announcement marks a departure from a 2021 statement on same-sex couples by Pope Francis that “God does not and cannot bless sin.” Elected in 2013, Francis’ papacy is generally viewed as liberal, particularly in comparison to his predecessor, Benedict XVI. This is in part because Francis has advocated for the decriminalization of homosexuality and because, when asked in 2013 about his views on gay priests, he famously replied, “Who am I to judge?” The declaration, “Fiducia Supplicans,” reiterates the traditional Catholic view on marriage, which it describes as “an indissoluble union between a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children.” Within Catholicism, marriage is considered a sacrament, which carries more religious weight and significance than a blessing. Fran DeGasta, director of religious education at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Norwich, acknowledged that the declaration “probably puzzles a lot of people” in that it does not bless or endorse civil unions. Rather, she said “his statement is ‘judge not lest you be judged.’ ” The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a statement last week explaining that a blessing is pastoral rather than sacramental and “may be given to persons who desire God’s loving grace in their lives.” “Fiducia Supplicans” advises clergy that “one should not prevent or prohibit the church’s closeness to people in every situation in which they might seek God’s help through a simple blessing.” But it also takes great pains to make clear that the declaration in no way condones same-sex marriage. Any blessing should strenuously avoid any “clothing, gestures or words that are proper to a wedding.” Instead, it encourages blessings to be offered in other contexts, such as visits to shrines or along pilgrimages. Wendy Piper, of Enfield, echoed DeGasta’s notion that “Fiducia Supplicans” is less rooted in forward-thinking progressivism than in more traditional Catholic humility. “Catholics tend to be very forgiving,” she said. “There’s a sense that we are aware of our own fallen-ness and limitations,” as well as “a sense that we respect mystery.” The Church’s evolving view on same-sex couples is, to Piper, an outgrowth of that humility and compassion rather than any forward-thinking intent or progressive ideology. Piper, a Grafton County commissioner and former state representative, and her partner, Julie, are parishioners at St. Francis in Norwich and have been together for 39 years. “God led me to Julie,” said Piper, who is a lector and Eucharistic minister of St. Francis. Their son was baptized at 2 years old in a traditional Catholic ceremony. “We’ve always had an active role in the church wherever we’ve been and had good friendships with priests,” said Piper, adding that “the bulk of that experience has not been with notably progressive priests or parishes.” “I was thrilled,” by the declaration, she said. Pope Francis “has done a really good thing. He has recognized the love between two people regardless of what package they come in.” The new statement on blessings of same-sex couples, she said, “recognizes families and helps us to live by the Gospel. The Catholic Church has recognized how important love is between two people.” Regarding same-sex unions, Piper said that “people can have different attitudes, but quite frankly I don’t care. Julie and I were together at a time when we had to make our own way.” Acknowledging that there will be critics who say that the declaration does not go far enough, she said that “you have to give tradition its due.” John MacGovern, administrative assistant at Our Lady of the Snows church in Woodstock, said Friday that nobody in either the parish’s laity or clergy was willing to speak on the topic.

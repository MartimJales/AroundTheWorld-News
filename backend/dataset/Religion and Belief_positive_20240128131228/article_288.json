    "text": "GEORGE TOWN: It will be a united Thaipusam this year with the involvement of both the golden and silver chariot on Jan 25.\nHindu Endowment Board chairman RSN Rayer said the board worked in unison with the Nattukotai Chettiar Temple trustees.\n\"We have held several discussions and are working towards coordinating the chariots for the procession.\n\"We share a cordial relationship with the Nattukotai Chettiar Temple trustees and are looking forward to holding a world-class Thaipusam for all to experience.\n\"We are responsible for ensuring it is carried out smoothly and is a united Thaipusam celebration.\n\"Thaipusam is for the service of the people, and we want everyone to take part.\n\"We want to show how the Hindu community can unite and celebrate Thaipusam together,\" he said during a press conference held at the Hindu Endowment Board office along Macalister Road on Friday (Dec 29).\n\"We have had several discussions with the temple to coordinate the chariots and preparations for Thaipusam.\n\"We have heard feedback from the people about the timing of the chariots as people wait for both, and sometimes it has taken a while between the arrival of the chariots.\n\"We are working on that to make it easier as there are many elderly people and families who wait to see both,\" he said.\nRayer said their focus is also to unite the Hindus in Penang and nationwide.\nNattukotai Chettiar Temple managing trustee AL Lakshmanan, said they have attended three meetings so far to prep for the celebration.\n\"We want to make sure both chariots reach the temples swiftly,\" he said.\nThe Thaipusam procession in Penang began in 1856, and the silver chariot has been used for about 120 years. The golden chariot was introduced in 2017.\nCOMPLI\nKeywords: United, Thaipusam, Golden Chariot, Silver Chariot, Hindu Endowment Board, RSN Rayer, Nattukotai Chettiar Temple, AL Lakshmanan,\nOpen Modal Ã—",

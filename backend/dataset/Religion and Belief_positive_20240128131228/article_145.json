    "text": "Please note: This is a stickied sponsored post. [Healing Hearts Is Here For Any Jew In South Florida Who Is Facing A Medical Journey Or Crisis, With Kosher Rooms, Chessed Houses, Medical Consultation, And More!](https://hhflorida.com/hereforyou) Founded 20 years ago by Rabbi Yochanon Klein and his aishes chayil Esti, Healing Hearts began with establishing kosher rooms and Chessed Houses in Miami-based hospitals. Since their modest beginning, Healing Heartsâ€™ operations have exploded, especially in recent years as the always-popular Yeshiva Week hotspot has seen a huge influx of Jewish families relocating to the Sunshine State to live permanently. We have now expanded to a team of 10 members, all passionate about helping Klal Yisrael. We have 7 kosher rooms in various hospitals, Chessed Houses near 4 hospitals, a dedicated medical referral team, family support and respite, and post-hospital guidance. We are having an end-of-year campaign, where every dollar is doubled. When you partner with us, your donation goes directly to helping Jews in need in Florida. [Support Healing Hearts year end fundraiser here and support their incredible work!](https://hhflorida.com/hereforyou)",

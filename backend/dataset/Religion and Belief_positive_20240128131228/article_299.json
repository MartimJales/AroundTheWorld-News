    "text": "\"Maharshi Valmiki had formed Lord Ram's ideology, his personality and made him accessible to ordinary people. Valmiki had made Ram the person he is today, taking Sanatan culture to new heights. Tomorrow is a big day that the Ayodhya airport will be named after Maharshi Valmiki,\" Jaiveer Singh said speaking to ANI on Friday. The name of the new airport was changed to 'Maharishi Valmiki International Airport Ayodhya Dham' on Thusday, days ahead of Narendra Modi's visit to Ayodhya on December 30. \"Tomorrow is going to be a big day not just for the people of Uttar Pradesh but also for all the believers of Sanatana Dharma and those who believe in development. We welcome Narendra Modi,\" the Uttar Pradesh Minister said welcoming the Prime Minister to Ayodhya. Speaking on the railway station in Ayodhya that will also be inaugurated by the Prime Minister, Jaiveer Singh said, \"Ayodhya Dham railway station will also be inaugurated tomorrow, many trains will be flagged off. Several new railway projects will be inaugurated. The double line will also be inaugurated tomorrow.\" \"Projects worth thousands of crores will be inaugurated tomorrow by Prime Minister Modi and we heartily welcome him to our state,\" he added. \"Phase 1 of the state-of-the-art airport is developed at a cost of more than Rs 1,450 crore. The airport's terminal building will have an area of 6500 sqm, equipped to serve about 10 lakh passengers annually. The facade of the Terminal Building depicts the temple architecture of the upcoming Shri Ram Mandir of Ayodhya. The interiors of the terminal Building are decorated with local art, paintings and murals depicting the life of Bhagwan Shri Ram,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. The terminal building of Ayodhya airport is also equipped with various sustainability features like an insulated roofing system, LED lighting, rainwater harvesting, landscaping with fountains, a water treatment plant, sewage treatment plant, solar power plant and many other such features have been provided to meet GRIHA - 5-star ratings. The airport will improve connectivity in the region, leading to a boost in tourism, business activities and employment opportunities, the PMO said. (ANI)",

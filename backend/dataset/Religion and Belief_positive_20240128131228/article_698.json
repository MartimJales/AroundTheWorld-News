    "text": "Brightside Opportunities Center celebrates Kwanzaa It's the fourth day of Kwanzaa and Brightside Opportunities Center in Lancaster is honoring African American cultural and historical heritage. Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the 1960's. The celebration was created to give African Americans an opportunity to reconnect with their culture and dig deeper into their roots. To celebrate Kwanzaa, African Americans fellowship over a meal, dance, play music, and acknowledge the seven principles. A ceremony is also held and it includes drumming, music, poems, and reading of the African Pledge. The seven principles are, Umjoja, Kujichagulia, Ujima, Ujamaa, Nia, Kuumba, and Imani. Each day consists of a candle-lighting on the Kinara with three colors, Black, Green, and Red. Isaiah Perry, Program Coordinator at Brightside Opportunities Center says they use the seven principles every day. \"Here at Brightside Opportunities Center, we're living today principal Ujama cooperative economics throughout STEM programming, we have girls who code program that not only pays the girls 1500 but teaches them how to use their voice,\" said Perry.

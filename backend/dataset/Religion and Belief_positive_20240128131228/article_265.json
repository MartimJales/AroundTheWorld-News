The head of the lone research centre on Lord Ram said that no one ever imagined that Ayodhya, which has been neglected for the past 20 years, would take the form of such a 'big city'. \"Unimaginable. We had never thought that Ayodhya, which has been neglected for the past 20 years, would take the form of such a big city today. I think that Ayodhya will be the biggest site of Hindutva at the international level,\" Ajay Pratap Singh said on the consecration ceremony of Lord Ram Temple here on January 22. The research centre, also known as Ram Shodh Peeth, in the temple city's Rammanohar Lohia Avadh University, was established in 2001 and it works to unearthen any fact about Lord Ram hidden in history.

    "text": "Dibrugarh: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday asserted that every nation has its own unique way of life which is derived from its culture.“The 'sanskriti' (culture) of Bharat is reflected through 'Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti' (truth is one but it's revealed by intellectuals differently). This all-inclusive tradition exists only in Bharat,” Bhagwat said at the ‘Poorvottar Sant Manikanchan Sammelan’ at the North Kamalabari Satra in Assam’s Majuli.The event saw the presence of 104 spiritual leaders representing 48 Satras of Assam and 37 religious institutions and sects from across the NE. Addressing the gathering, Bhagwat said the country has to stand firm to give the message of peace and coexistence to the world and “to fulfil this noble task, the revered spiritual leaders will have to come forward in our society”.“We all have the same ancestors and the same values. We will have to take our unity forward while adhering to our diversity. Unity is not uniformity, but it is unionness,” he added. He urged all to work towards making society self-reliant through service, education, healthcare and employment.After the session, Bhagwat visited the Dakshinpat Satra in Majuli, where he engaged in an enriching discussion with the Satradhikar and the disciples. This visit provided an opportunity for Bhagwat to gain firsthand insights into the spiritual practices and beliefs upheld by the Satra. Bhagwat is scheduled to visit the famous Auniati Satra on Friday morning. During his visit, he will engage in a discussion with the Satradhikar Pitambar Deva Goswami, covering a wide range of pertinent issues.The RSS chief will also address a public rally at the Garmur Mini Stadium in Majuli, where he is expected to share his thoughts on preserving the unique cultural heritage of Majuli, the world’s largest river island.We also published the following articles recentlyExplaining Death through Bhagwat Gita versesBhagwat Gita believes that Death is a mere transition of the soul. It looks at Death as the soul merely changing its garb as it moves from life to life. The body is mortal, while the soul is not. Chapter 2, Verse 27 states that for one who has been born, death is certain, and for one who has died, birth is certain. Chapter 2, Verse 20 emphasizes that the soul never takes birth and never dies at any time, it is birthless, eternal, imperishable, and timeless. According to Chapter 2, Verse 22, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old ones, just like a person puts on new garments. Chapter 2, Verse 23 highlights that the soul cannot be harmed by weapons, fire, water, or wind. Lastly, in Chapter 2, Verse 13, it is stated that just as the soul passes through different stages of life in the body, it similarly passes into another body at death, and a wise person is not deluded by this change.106313047Spiritual destinations in India you must visitSpirituality is about connecting deeply with oneself irrespective of surroundings.

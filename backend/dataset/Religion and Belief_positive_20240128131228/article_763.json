    "text": "McKinney, Texas (Dec 28, 2023) – As 2023 draws to a close, are you looking to make a last-minute tax-deductible donation? The Texas Giving Machines offer an easy way to give to meet the end-of-year tax deadline. The Machines are located at 110 North Tennessee in historic downtown McKinney, a few doors from Hugs Café, one of the charities it benefits. The Giving Machines will be open through Jan. 1, 2024. Visitors can make donations with the swipe of a card by purchasing items ranging in price from $5 to $150 for eight local charities and two global charities. Donations include staples such as clothing, meals and school supplies, medical equipment and livestock. To give online, donations can also be made at lighttheworld.org/give for those not able to visit the machines in person. One hundred percent of all donations go directly to the participating charities. This is the first year that the Giving Machines have come to north Texas, which is one of only 61 cities worldwide to host Light the World Giving Machines in 2023. In addition to Hugs Café, the machine will benefit seven other charities locally in the metroplex, including: And two global charities: The #LightTheWorld Giving Machines were launched in Salt Lake City by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which covers the overhead costs. Since 2017, the initiative has raised over $22 million for its participating charities. For more information, go to givingmachine.org. And on social, #LightTheWorld or #GivingMachineKC.",

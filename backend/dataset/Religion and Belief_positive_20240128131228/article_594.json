    "text": "Grammy Award-winning rapper\nLecrae, who is arguably Christian’s most popular hip hop artist, was interviewed by TODAY show co-host Craig Melvin last week (Dec. 22) to discuss the 20-year anniversary of the release of his first album, “Real Talk.”\nLecrae shared how he has been able to witness what began as an “underground movement” blossom into a something that is now nationally known.\nDescribing Christian hip hop in the early 2000s, Lecrae told Melvin, “It was like an underground movement. I remember in 2011 being able to do the BET Awards and being on a national stage and just the world opened up.”\n“I’m not ashamed to acknowledge my faith—that I believe in Jesus,” Lecrae said in response to a question about whether he considers himself a Christian who performs hip hop or a hip hop artist who is a Christian. “But I do think ‘Christian’ is a better noun than it is an adjective. It’s like, who am I—and that defines me as a person. What I do is different, and so I want to be respected for what I do.”\nRELATED:\nLecrae Reaches Out to Lil Nas X, Encourages Christians Not To Condemn the ‘Satan Shoes’ Creator\nThe Reach Records cofounder also answered a question regarding the criticism he’s received from church leaders and fans for talking about social justice.\n“When I talked about racial injustice people perceived it as being political. I was like, no, I’m being biblical,” Lecrae said, going on to reference Jesus’ famous Good Samaritan parable. “I care about people who are broken. They couldn’t understand that.”\nLecrae believes that Christian hip hop is both “good music for the church and it’s good music from the church to the world.” He added, “That’s beneficial for everybody.”\nMelvin told his co-hosts that the goal of the Christian hip hop is to “introduce the goodness of God to a new audience. So what they’re doing is meeting the audience where they are with a genre that they can relate to.” Melvin also commended Lecrae for not just talking the talk, but walking the walk, referencing how\nLecrae does a lot of work in his community and helps mentor young men.\nRELATED:\nLecrae’s ‘Prostitution Story’ Illustrates the Worth That All People Have\nRadio personality and TODAY show co-host Carson Daly said that what Lecrae is doing “needs more press” and thanked Melvin for doing the interview. Daly added, “The light has got to be shined on this genre of music and get more publicity.”",

    "text": "Gifts of the Holy Spirit - what's yours?\nAnd how do you use it for the benefit of humanity?\nLove is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you. You can never lose it, and it cannot leave you. You can feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is love. What is God? The Eternal One Life underneath all the forms of life. What is love? To feel the presence of that One Life deep within yourself and within all creatures. To be it. Therefore, all love is the love of God.\nDeath is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret of life is to die before you die - and find that there is no death.\nAnd do you have more than one?\nI think we all have them all, but maybe one or two are more predominant.\nLove is a state of Being.

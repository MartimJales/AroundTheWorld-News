    "text": "Denver, Colo., Dec 29, 2023 / 08:00 am According to the [U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)](https://www.usccb.org/committees/catholic-education/catholic-colleges-and-universities-united-states), there are almost 250 Catholic colleges and universities in the U.S. [Recent information from the Cardinal Newman Society](https://cardinalnewmansociety.org/wp-content/uploads/Press-Release-Newman-Guide-Colleges-Are-Light-in-the-Darkness11-16-23-1.pdf), a nonprofit founded to promote and defend faithful Catholic education, shows that some have experienced remarkable growth over the past year. In 2023, Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina welcomed its largest incoming class, marking an almost 10% increase from 2022, and Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas, reported a record undergraduate class of 2,213 students â€” a 121% growth over the past 20 years. Christendom College in Front Royal, Virginia, welcomed 172 new students to campus, reaching its 550 total student body size cap; the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota, had the largest freshmen class in its history this year; and the University of St. Thomas-Houston also had a record-breaking number of new incoming undergraduate students. Wyoming Catholic College, one of the youngest Catholic colleges on the block, experienced continual growth as well. CNA took a closer look at three Catholic universities that have experienced impressive growth in 2023, as well as one college that is preparing to close its doors.",

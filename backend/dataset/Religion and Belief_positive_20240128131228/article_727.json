    "text": "Dec 29 Dec 29 We Wish You a Merry Christmas! Valerie Gus and Milo had a good Christmas, even though Gus was on the naughty list. Since it was Milo’s first Christmas, we had to introduce him to all of the family traditions.\nIt started on Christmas Eve. The boys donned their festive bandanas and we went out for pizza at Via 313. It’s the perfect spot because (1) they are open on Christmas Eve, (2) it is delicious, and (3) all four of us love their cheese sticks.\nAfter pizza, we drove around looking at Christmas lights. We found some pretty good displays (and wondered where people store all their decorations the rest of the year!) Then it was time to go to sleep until morning.\nChristmas morning, Milo got to experience something new - clothes. He was a good sport about wearing his Christmas pajamas and didn’t seem bothered by them at all. Gus was his normal helpful self and tried to melt into the floor while I put his pajamas on.\nMilo got several new toys. He loves toys and is so good about not destroying them or eating any part of the toy. After Gus and Milton, we don’t quite know how to handle this behavior.\nGus didn’t get as many treats as he would have since he ate them during his closet spree, but he still got some Kong squirt stuff and a food dispensing toy.\nBoth boys got goodie boxes from Best Bully Sticks and giant bones to eat outside. (Hopefully Gus won’t try to swallow it whole!)\nAfter opening presents, playing with new toys, and eating some treats, we enjoyed a Christmas feast. Milo could hardly contain his excitement for everything and we decided Gus doesn’t care for asparaGUS because it was the last thing he ate from his bowl!\nI’d say it was a successful first Christmas because Milo seemed worn out!\nWe will leave you with one last photo, a blooper. Milo is giving David major side-eye for making him pose by the Christmas tree.",

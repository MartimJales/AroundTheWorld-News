    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported. The once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported. Here’s what we know about the date. Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated. FYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches. A palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. Numerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated. Here are all palindrome dates that will occur in 2024, courtesy of the Farmer’s Almanac : Contributing: Olivia Munson, USA Today 30 famous Capricorns you should know: These celebrities belong to the winter Zodiac sign",

    "text": "“Purity and simplicity are the two wings with which man soars above the earth and all temporary nature.” —Thomas à Kempis\nSimplifying your life will bring balance, freedom, and joy. When we begin to live simply and experience these benefits, we begin to ask the next question, “Where else in my life can I remove distraction and simplify life to focus on the essentials?”\nOnce we’re able to answer that, we will understand what is important in our own lives.\nHow to Simplify Your Life\nBased on our personal journey, our conversations, and our observations, here is a list of the 10 most important things to simplify in your life today to begin living a more balanced, joyful lifestyle:\n1. Your Possessions – Too many material possessions complicate our lives to a greater degree than we ever give them credit. They drain our bank account, our energy, and our attention. They keep us from the ones we love and from living a life based on our values.\nIf you will invest the time to\ndeclutter the non-essential possessions from your life, you will never regret it. For more inspiration, consider Simplify: 7 Guiding Principles to Help Anyone Declutter Their Home and Life.\n2. Your Time Commitments – Most of us have filled our days full from beginning to end with time commitments: work, home, kid’s activities, community events, religious endeavors, hobbies… the list goes on. When possible,\nrelease yourself from the time commitments that are not in line with your greatest values.\n3. Your Goals – Reduce the number of goals you are striving for in your life to one or two. By reducing the number of goals that you are striving to accomplish, you will improve your focus and your success rate.\nMake a list of\nthe things that you want to accomplish in your life and choose the three most important. Focus there.\n4. Your Negative Thoughts – Most negative emotions are completely useless. Resentment, bitterness, hate, and jealousy have never improved the quality of life for a single human being.\nTake responsibility for your mind. Forgive past hurts and replace negative thoughts with positive ones.\n5. Your Debt – If\nFind the help that you need and learn\nhow to get out of debt. Sacrifice luxury today to enjoy freedom tomorrow.\n6. Your Words – Use fewer words. Keep your speech plain and honest. Mean what you say. Avoid gossip.\n7. Your Artificial Ingredients – Avoid trans fats, refined grain (white bread), high-fructose corn syrup, and too much sodium. Minimizing these ingredients will improve your energy level in the short-term and your health in the long-term.\nAlso, as much as possible, reduce your consumption of over-the-counter medicine – allow your body to heal itself naturally as opposed to building a dependency on substances.\n8. Your Screen Time – Focusing your attention on television, movies, video games, and\ntechnology addiction affects your life more than you think. Media rearranges your values. It begins to dominate your life. And it has a profound impact on your attitude and outlook.\nUnfortunately, when you live in that world on a consistent basis, you don’t even notice how it is impacting you. The only way to fully appreciate its influence in your life is to turn them off.\n9. Your Connections to the World – Relationships with others are good, but constant streams of distraction are bad. Learn when to power off the phone, log off social media, or not read a text. Focus on the important, not the urgent.\nA steady flow of distractions from other people may make us feel important, needed, or wanted, but feeling important and accomplishing importance are completely different things.\n10. Your Multi-Tasking – Research indicates that multi-tasking increases stress and lowers productivity. While single-tasking is becoming a lost art, learn it.\nHandle one task at a time. Do it well. And when it is complete, move to the next.\nSimplifying your life is a core aspect of minimalism. To learn more about this lifestyle, visit\nthis primer on minimalism.",

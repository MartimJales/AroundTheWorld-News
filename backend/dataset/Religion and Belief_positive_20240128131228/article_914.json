    "text": "MANILA, Philippines: President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Saturday urged Filipinos to emulate the \"timeless values\" of Dr. Jose Rizal, as the nation commemorates the hero's 127th death anniversary.\nAccompanied by his wife, First Lady Marie Louise \"Liza\" Araneta-Marcos, and their children—Ilocos Norte 1st District Rep. Ferdinand Alexander, William Vincent, and Joseph Simon—the President arrived at 6:50 a.m. and received military honors to kick off a short commemorative ceremony at the Rizal Park in Manila.\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. joins the nation in paying tribute to the national hero in a ceremony at Rizal Park, City of Manila, on Saturday, December 30, 2023, in observance of the 127th anniversary of the martyrdom of Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Joining the Chief Executive in the occasion are NHCP Chairman Emmanuel Calairo and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff General Romeo Brawner Jr. PHOTO BY: RENE H. DILAN It was followed by a flag-raising rite attended by military and government officials, including National Historical Commission of the Philippines Chairman Emmanuel Franco Calairo.\nMarcos offered a wreath at the Rizal National Monument after the flag-raising ceremony, which was held simultaneously in various historical sites nationwide.\nHe asked Filipinos to take inspiration from Rizal's sacrifice and develop a sense of ownership to the land.",

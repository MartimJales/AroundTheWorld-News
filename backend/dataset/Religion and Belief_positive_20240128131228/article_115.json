    "text": "For 1,500 years, people have been toasting the New Year with alcohol. It was first recorded during the reign of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar and became an American tradition when European settlers [started arriving in North America](https://imbibemagazine.com/why-we-drink-champagne-on-new-years-eve/). In Colonial times in the U.S., New Year’s Eve became a time when young women would make a large bowl of wassail, a spiced ale, and would take it door to door and offer it to people in exchange for a gift. But nowadays, finding a New Year’s Eve celebration without alcohol is difficult for those recovering from addiction, especially in Denton where it often feels like the bars may outnumber the churches. It’s one of the reasons the Denton Freedom House, a local nonprofit focused on addiction recovery, started the annual Jesus Jam event at Zera Coffee to offer a New Year’s Eve celebration free from temptation. Sunday’s Jesus Jam will not only offer an alcohol-free environment for a family-friendly evening, but also a chili cook-off, games for both adults and children and live music from Freedom Song, a band made up of alumni from the Denton Freedom House program. The event kicks off at 7 p.m. Sunday and lasts until midnight. There is a $10 cover charge for food and a raffle ticket for items donated by local businesses. “Because Jesus and freedom from addiction are at the core of what we do, Jesus Jam remains a sober- and faith-filled event to celebrate New Year’s with others,” Jason Young, a development associate from Denton Freedom House, wrote in a Dec. 12 press release. This freedom-from-addiction mission, Young said, began nearly 20 years ago in Denton. Originally from Waco, Young was one of those people who sought recovery at Denton Freedom House. Young’s addiction had landed him in jail, and he contacted the program for help. “I wanted to get sober,” Young said. “I was addicted to pain medicine and alcohol and needed a place to go when I got out of jail.” Most people with substance use disorder [don’t receive treatment](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2023-01-06-survey-most-americans-substance-use-disorders-dont-receive-treatment#:~:text=Survey%3A%20Most%20Americans%20with%20substance%20use%20disorders%20don't%20receive%20treatment,-Jan%2006%2C%202023&text=Over%2046%20million%20Americans%20aged,of%20Drug%20Use%20and%20Health.), according to the American Hospital Association. Young joined the addiction treatment program at Denton Freedom House in 2019. Three years later, Young had graduated from the program, served as a volunteer and then became a full-time staff member helping others who struggled with addiction. According to the AHA, 46 million Americans ages 12 and older were living with a substance abuse disorder in 2021. Young said the Jesus Jam New Year’s Eve celebration is just one of several events that Denton Freedom House hosts throughout the year. The event was free in previous years. However, this year a charge of $10 was added to cover the costs of the drinks, hot dogs and other snacks that will be available. A raffle ticket is also included. It’s similar to how Denton Freedom House operates Zera Coffee. Known for its slogan “Coffee With a Cause,” Zera is one way that Young said the nonprofit generates funds for the program. It also teaches those who seek help there “ [to become prosperous](https://dentonfreedomhouse.org/zera-coffee-and-event-center/) disciples of Christ in a sober and healthy workplace.\" “It’s that theme of Christianity and helping that community,” Young said. “This is just one of the events and the close-out event.” Wake Up with the DR-C: Get today's headlines in your inbox Success!

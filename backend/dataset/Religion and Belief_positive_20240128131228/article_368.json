    "text": "Peggy Jean Randol\nLONGVIEW — Beautiful, talented daughter, sister, wife, mother, grand-mother, and great grand-mother, who lived her life the way she was taught, to glorify God and to love her family, Peggy Randol, 70, of Longview died on December 17, 2023. Peggy Jean McDaniel was born on September 17, 1953 in Paris, Illinois to Philip Gene and Eileen Slager McDaniel who were wonderful Christian examples who influenced Peggy throughout her life. Peggy lost her mother at the tender age of 18. She attended schools in Houston and Lufkin before graduating from high school in Mahomet, Illinois in 1971. Peggy’s son Joshua Randol was born in 1977 and immediately began his family having Joshua II in 2000 and Riley in 2003. Heather and Joshua couldn’t wait to start a family of their own, and Jackson and Jameson were born in 2021. Joshua’s first child, Joshua II, had a child in 2021, named Jameson who was Peggy’s first great grand-child! Jacob Randol was born in 1979 and began his family with Michelle. They have 2 children, Jeg born in 2010 and Jase born in 2013. Peggy met the love of her life, Mark Feller in 2006, and the two chose Longview as their residence. Though Peggy loved to buy at thrift shops, estate sales, and garage sales, her favorite role was that as grandma. She treasured her time talking with her sons and her grandkids and loved being their grandma never failing to remember their birthdays or Christmas. Peggy loved to cruise having taken several cruises already and scheduled for another in June 2024 with members of her family. Peggy was passionate about her jobs as Educational Recruiter for Lincoln Tech, Westwood College, and Devry University. She began her career in sales while working for Home Interiors. She was working for Lincoln Tech until the day she died. Peggy attended Gilmer Methodist Church enjoying parties and family activities with Mark. Peggy will always be remembered for her caring compassion for her grandchildren and the way that she would “facetime” her youngest grandchildren, Jackson and Jameson. We couldn’t have asked for a better grandma and will miss her every day. Her memory will live on in the hearts of all those who loved her. Nothing is the same without her!! Peggy was preceded in death by her parents and is survived by Mark Feller of Longview, her sons Joshua and wife Heather Randol of Jackson, Missouri and Jacob and wife Michelle Randol of Ottawa, Kansas, her sister Phyllis and husband Tim Burgess of Philo, Illinois, her brother Philip and wife Cindy McDaniel of Gulf Shores, Alabama, and her brother Pat and wife Mindy McDaniel of Atlanta, Georgia, numerous nephews and nieces, six grand-children and one great grandson! Memorials may be made to Gilmer Methodist Church or the charity of your choice.",

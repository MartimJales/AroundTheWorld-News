    "text": "Christian Pilgrims Commission congratulates new NAHCON Chairman, Jalal Arabi The acting Chairman of National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), on Thursday, hosted his counterpart from the Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), Revd Dr. Yakubu Pam, who was on a courtesy visit to the Hajj House to extend warm congratulations to the newly appointed Chairman, Malam Jalal Ahmad Arabi. According to a statement by the Assistant Director, Public Affairs NAHCON, Fatima Sanda Usara: ”The congratulatory visit served as a testament to the spirit of unity and cooperation between the two religious pilgrimage bodies.” Arabi acknowledged the importance of collaboration in traversing its operational complexities. He expressed his gratitude to his Christian counterpart for the visit. He described the chairman of the Christian Pilgrims Commission as a brother and veteran in the field, highlighting the significance of patience, shared experiences in navigating the trials associated with organising pilgrimage. Pam expressed sincere wishes for success of Arabi in his new role and assured him of unwavering support. He prayed for his victory even in demanding moments, while expressing confidence that he would make Nigeria and humanity proud knowing his antecedents. Pam was accompanied by the Director of Operations, Mr Abu Okpanachi; Special Assistant to the Executive Secretary (ES), Mr Barnabas Ali; Deputy Director and Head Planning, Research and Programme Development, Mr Nkaiso Ndemenang; Deputy Director and Head Media and Public Relations, Mr Celestine Toruka as well as Head of Protocol, Mrs. Charlin Makai. The exchange of goodwill between the leaders of Christian and Muslim pilgrimage commissions reaffirms the commitment to harmonious coexistence and joint efforts in addressing the unique challenges posed by pilgrimage activities.

    "text": "2023-12-28 23:56:04 NOTICIACRISTIANA.COM- On a missionary trip, Melissa Coselho from Bahía, celebrated her 15th birthday, on a missionary trip to Chile. In the country, he spent 12 days evangelizing a Haitian community, in Puente Alto, in Santiago. The teenager managed to pay for the trip, through a YouTube campaign, and the sale of truffles, as reported [Guiame.com.](https://www.guiame.com.br/gospel/missoes-acao-social/adolescente-vende-trufas-e-faz-videos-no-youtube-para-pagar-viagem-missionaria.html) She always participated in church activities, and was always involved in the missions ministry. In her heart, Melissa felt the desire to embark on a missionary trip, to bring the Gospel to the world. “I want my steps to be directed by God. My 15th birthday party turned into a failed plan, but God comforted me through a call to go on a mission trip to Chile. He always does what is best for us,” he said. Melissa explained that the economic obstacle was something that initially prevented her from achieving her goal. Citing the passage of Joshua and Caleb to enter the Promised Land, the teenager stated: “Before me is a great Promised Land, and I see insurmountable barriers. “I am crossing the desert, but I do not want to lose sight of the vision of Canaan,” she declared. Prayed to the Lord Melissa prayed and asked the Lord to help her. After asking for donations on social media and receiving help from her mother to supplement the amount by selling truffles, she got the money to pay for her trip. In addition, the teenager also donated part of the money raised to help a friend, who was also unable to travel to Chile. Melissa thanked everyone who gave her the opportunity to make her dream come true: “My parents, friend and even the people who encouraged, prayed and donated to my campaign, without you, none of this would be possible,” she said. Finally she shared: “I am a normal teenager, like everyone else, but I seek the Lord tirelessly,” Melissa concluded. Published by: NOTICIACRISTIANA.COM.

    "text": "Ulema, Mashaykh Observe ‘Children's Protection Day' Nationwide\nFaizan Hashmi\nPublished December 29, 2023 | 11:34 PM\nReligious scholars and leaders representing various schools of thought, on the call of Pakistan Ulema Council, on Friday observed ‘Children's Protection Day’ nationwide\nISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 29th Dec, 2023) Religious scholars and leaders representing various schools of thought, on the call of\nPakistan Ulema Council, on Friday observed ‘Children's Protection Day’ nationwide.\nThe Ulema and Mashaykh, in their Friday sermons, urged urge the public to ensure administration of\npolio vaccine their children, thereby safeguarding them from potential lifelong disabilities.\nPUC Chairman Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mahmoud Ashrafi, Allama Ziaullah Shah Bukhari, Pir Naqibur Rahman, and others, in their sermons, said it was imperative to emphasize that the administration of\npolio drops was entirely lawful as they had no adverse impact on human structure and did not induce weakness in children.\nThey said, “Islamic Shariah also advocates avoiding risks to oneself and one's children. Thus, it becomes a parental responsibility to get administered\npolio drops, and those who neglect this duty may, unfortunately, subject their children to the consequences of polio. Such negligence would be viewed unfavorably by Allah and society.”\nThe scholars and leaders asserted that\nopposition or resistance to polio vaccination in https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/pakistan.html was rooted in ignorance. Those who spread propaganda against the vital campaign were, in essence, jeopardizing the health of children, they added.\nHistorically, they said\npolio was prevalent in different parts of the world, including America, Great Britain, European countries, and India.\n“However, these nations dedicated relentless efforts to control and eventually eliminate the disease. Today, they stand free\nfrom its grip. Regrettably, https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/pakistan.html still grapples with polio,” they maintained.\nThey said international health organizations were diligently working to eradicate the disease by administering vaccinations to children and Islamic scholars actively supported such initiatives.\nDespite those efforts, they said, certain elements, driven by ignorance or ulterior motives, continued to obstruct the\nprogress in combating polio.\nThe religious scholars and leaders emphasized that vaccines were a form of medicine, and the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) regarding the use of medicine were unequivocal.\nPolio was an ailment for which there was no cure once contracted.\nQuoting Allah's guidance in the Holy Quran against self-harm, they highlighted the\nmoral imperative of not allowing a child to suffer a lifelong disability by withholding necessary medication.\nThey further asserted that “the choice lies between nurturing a nation of sound mental and physical health or one burdened with mental and physical handicaps. Those impeding children\nfrom receiving polio vaccinations should reflect on this consequential decision.”",

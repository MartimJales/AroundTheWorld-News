It upholds the principle of causality and the impermanence of everything. The doctrine led to the theory of momentariness and the middle path. It is also known as the wheel of rebirth, the wheel of becoming, the wheel of existence, or the 12 sources. The existential fact of suffering is due to birth, which is caused by the will to be born and the clinging to sense objects. Sense-object contact, sense organs, and initial consciousness play a role in this process. Ignorance leads to suffering, while knowledge leads to liberation and nirvana.106352302Gautam Buddha's quotes on love and lifeGautam Buddha, also known as Siddhartha Gautam, was a spiritual teacher and the founder of Buddhism.

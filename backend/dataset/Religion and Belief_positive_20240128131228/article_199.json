    "text": "- By [Kashish Rai](/authors/kashish-rai) - Updated: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 10:59 AM (IST) - Source:JND Sunderkand Path Benefits: The fifth chapter in the renowned Hindu epic Ramayana is called Sundarkand. It was originally written by the renowned sage Valmiki in Sanskrit. Afterwards, the chapter was translated into Awadhi as Ramcharitmanas by Goswami Tulsidas. Sundarkand generally refers to The Book of Splendour. This book typically depicts the grandeur of Lord Hanuman's devotion and the realisation of his abilities during the Ramayana conflict between Lord Rama and the demon King Ravana. Reciting this sacred text might also resolve oneâ€™s persistent problems. Let us check out the significance, vidhi, and benefits of chanting Sunderkand Path to seek the blessings of Lord Hanuman.

In addition, he crosses the ocean and defeats demons without a curse to get to Lanka and meet Goddess Sita. This chapter tells the story of Lord Ram's devotion to his wife and how he sent Hanumana to deliver a message to her. It grants Goddess Sita bliss and ends her long-suffering. Reciting the Sunderkand Path can lead to happiness and prosperity and remove barriers from one's path.

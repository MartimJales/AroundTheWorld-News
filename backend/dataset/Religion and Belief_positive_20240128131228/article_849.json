    "text": "‘King of Mandopop’ composes first Christmas-themed song\nMandopop’s Reigning King Jay Chou, recently crowned as DIOR’s newest global ambassador, is set to dazzle the world this Christmas season with his first holiday-themed single, ‘Christmas Star.’ Completing his electrifying ‘Carnival’ world tour in Bangkok, Jay Chou’s stage presence was accentuated by a series of stunning outfits, exclusively designed by DIOR’s Creative Director, Kim Jones, highlighting the singer’s new role with the fashion giant.\nThe ‘King of Mandopop’ presents this new single as a heartfelt Christmas gift to his fans worldwide, crafted amidst a whirlwind of activities including his recent partnership with Universal Music Group, his ongoing Netflix series “J-Style Trip 2,” and his ambassadorial duties for Dior. This new Christmas tune is poised to be a festive addition to holiday playlists globally.\nReturning to Thailand after years, Jay Chou’s recent concerts saw over 70,000 fans, setting a record at the Rajamangala National Stadium. His album “Greatest Works of Art” broke records last year, placing a Mandarin artist in the top 10 of the IFPI 2022 Global Artist Chart and topping the Global Album Sales Chart for the first time. His contributions to film and art, including roles in “The Green Hornet” and “Now You See Me 2,” as well as collaborations with Christie’s and Sotheby’s, reflect his limitless approach to life and art.\nThe ‘Christmas Star’ music video, set in a picturesque European town, features Jay Chou in a cabin adorned with Christmas decorations, marking Jay Chou’s first foray into writing a song specifically for the Christmas season.\n“This Christmas, Jay is set to enrich the holiday repertoire with his new single ‘Christmas Star.’ His fans are eagerly anticipating more influential works that will further elevate his artistic and cultural impact around the world.”\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jaychou/",

    "text": "Boxing star Gervonta Davis is now formally a man of faith. Videos circulating over the holiday showed the hard-hitting southpaw from Baltimore converting to Islam in a ceremony held at a mosque outside his hometown. The news was confirmed by The Brooklyn Banner, which spoke to Philadelphia-based Imam Hassan Abdi, who performed the rites. As part of the ritual, Davis also assumed a Muslim name, Abdul Wahid, which means “servant of the one.” Davis’ ring moniker is The One. “The humility I get from him — and I was surprised meeting him, because I knew who he was but I wasn’t familiar to what extent — he was a very down-to-earth person,” Abdi said of his long talk with Davis in an interview with The Baltimore Banner. “The conversation was about being the best version of what we can be as human beings. Last week, Davis held a press conference with city officials to announce his purchase of a slew of homes in his old West Baltimore neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester with the intention to renovate for affordable housing. “I definitely want to thank everybody that was included and helped us make this happen,” Davis said in a statement. “I feel as though when I was coming up, we didn't have somebody to be hands-on with us.” “Tank, when he goes around the world, he literally carries the city of Baltimore on his back,” said Baltimore City Council President Nick Mosby. For you to come back, invest in your hometown, invest in your community, and invest in your block—is truly, truly special.\" However, not long after the presser, a video shared by Davis’ longtime trainer Calvin Ford showed that several of the homes had burned down from a fire. Davis (29-0, 27 KOs) last fought in April, when knocked out Ryan Garcia inside seven rounds in their high-profile match at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Earlier this year, Davis, 29, pleaded guilty to several counts of a hit-and-run incident stemming from 2020 and was sentenced to 90 days of home detention. But less than a month into his sentencing, Davis was jailed for violating the terms of his home detention. Davis was released after six weeks.

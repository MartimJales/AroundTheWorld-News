    "text": "Thomas Merton’s Blueprint for a More Contemplative Life\nBy age 25, my grandmother had accompanied her mother in marching for women’s suffrage, lived through World War I, survived the Great Depression, and served in the Navy during World War II. After she died in 2009, a box of her favorite books passed down to me, her youngest grandchild. I imagined the box would be filled with stories matching the pace of her early life. Instead, it only contained books written by Thomas Merton, her favorite being The Seven Storey Mountain, the trappist monk’s spiritual autobiography.\nWhat about the life a monk could appeal to a woman who lived through the 20th century’s most significant events? Subjects like spirituality and the interior life remain elusive by nature, but Merton’s story and works offer my grandmother’s generation and modern readers a guiding light on the journey for peace. As this year marked The Seven Storey Mountain’s 75th anniversary, it’s worth thinking through the life of a man whose influence would sprawl the likes of\nDorothy Day, Evelyn Waugh, and who almost held a retreat with Martin Luther King Jr. before his assassination.\nBorn in 1915, Merton had an upbringing that paralleled my grandmother’s (and was in fact born just a year after her). From his early years to his time at Columbia University, Merton witnessed some of the major political, intellectual, and artistic movements of the 1930s. He frequented fervorous spaces, from communist meetups to anti-war protests. Some of his closest friends—the poet Robert Lax, the editor Robert Giroux, and the painter Ad Reinhardt—went on to be influential in the New York art scene. Merton’s college years teemed with thrills, love affairs, and partying in New York.\nIt’s tempting to romanticize this as a glamorous era, but Merton lamented this time of his life. “In devouring pleasures and joys,” he writes in The Seven Storey Mountain, “I had found distress and anguish and fear.” Despite his rich and varied experiences, Merton regarded this seemingly appealing life as an illusion: In gulping down the pleasures the world offered, he found himself still thirsty.\nprivacy policyand terms and conditions Sign In",

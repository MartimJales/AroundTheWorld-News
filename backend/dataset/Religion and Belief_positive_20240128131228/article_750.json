    "text": "The King has personally honoured the Archbishop of Canterbury by making him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) in recognition of his prominent role in the Coronation .\nThe Most Rev Justin Welby receives the award and is recognised together with others who helped to make the Coronation such a success , including the Crown Jeweller and the Master of the King’s Music.\nIt comes months after the Archbishop was criticised by Government ministers for using a speech in the House of Lords to criticise the Illegal Migration Bill . Tory MPs urged him to “stick to religion and keep out of politics”.\nAwards under the RVO are in the King’s gift and bestowed independently of Downing Street, which controls the main part of the New Year Honours list. The RVO was established by Queen Victoria to recognise distinguished personal service to the monarch or other members of the Royal family.\nThe Archbishop, who anointed and crowned the King during the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on May 6, will not be known as Sir Justin because the award is not technically a knighthood.\nA BBC documentary screened on Boxing Day gave an insight into the preparations for the Coronation , showing the King and Archbishop rehearsing together and sharing a joke.\nThe King was shown laughing and shaking his head when the Archbishop forgot his words at one point, and the Archbishop said later: “I have a memory that is probably about as good as our spaniel’s – in other words, zero.”\nThe Archbishop followed the longstanding tradition of commissioning a new Coronation liturgy – the prayers and actions of the Coronation service – which had the theme Called To Serve.\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury will not be known as Sir Justin because the award is not technically a knighthood Credit : GARETH FULLER/PA But his GCVO, as the award is known, may prove controversial with those who believe he has strayed too far into politics in recent months.\nIn May he made a speech in the House of Lords in which he said the Government’s immigration policy – aimed at stopping small boats crossing the Channel – “ignores the reality that global migration must be engaged with at source as well as in the Channel as if we as a country were unrelated to the rest of the world”.\nRobert Jenrick, the then immigration minister, said at the time that he was “wrong on both counts”. The Conservative MP James Daly, a member of the home affairs committee, responded at the time by saying: “The unelected Archbishop should stick to religion and keep out of politics. He moralises but comes up with no solutions… the Government was democratically elected to implement policies like this.”\nIt was just the latest in a series of controversies involving the Archbishop’s public opposition to Government policies including Brexit, austerity and benefit caps.\nIn February this year the heads of several branches of the Anglican Church in foreign countries said they no longer recognised the Archbishop as head of the Church because of the General Synod’s decision to allow same sex marriages and civil partnerships to be blessed in churches.\nThe RVOs are part of the wider New Year Honours and named among the recipients was Claire van Straubenzee , the mother of the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex’s late friend Henry van Straubenzee, who was killed in a 2002 car crash.\nOthers personally honoured by the King include Dr David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, who officiated during the Coronation , delivering St Edward’s Crown to the Archbishop. He has been made a Knight Commander of the RVO while his colleague Paul Baumann, Westminster Abbey’s receiver-general, equivalent to a chief executive, was made a Lieutenant of the RVO.\nMaintenance of the Crown Jewels Also made a Lieutenant is Mark Appleby, the Crown Jeweller, who is responsible for the maintenance of the Crown Jewels and was seen during the Coronation handing them from the altar at Westminster Abbey to those officiating. He is only the 10th person to hold the title since it was created in 1843\nSir Antonio Pappano, the Royal Opera House’s music director, who conducted the Coronation orchestra, is made a Commander of the RVO, and Colonel Jeremy Bagshaw, who in his former role as chief of staff at Army Headquarters London District oversaw the ceremonial role of the Household Division during the event, becomes a Lieutenant.\nThe main New Year Honours list, which is approved by the King on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, recognises the contribution to the Coronation of Judith Weir, Master of the King’s Music, with a damehood.\nShe composed a new piece, called Brighter Visions Shine Afar, that was performed as an overture at the Coronation. Dame Judith also wrote music for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and for the Platinum Jubilee in 2022.\nClaire van Straubenzee, the mother of the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex’s late friend Henry van Straubenzee, receives an MBE.\nMrs van Straubenzee co-founded a memorial fund named after her son, who was killed in a 2002 car crash, and which is supported by the two princes as patrons. She has been recognised for her charity’s work supporting education institutions in Uganda.\n‘An inspiration to us all’ Rowena Feilden, lady in waiting to the Princess Royal, is made a Dame Commander of the RVO.\nKaren Findlay, the Metropolitan Police Commander on operational duty during the Coronation is made a Lieutenant of the RVO, as are David Whelton and James Williams, who acted as the music advisers for the Coronation.\nWarrant Officer Class 2 Julian Sandford, Sergeant Major of the Band of the Household Cavalry during the Coronation parade, is made a member of the Royal Victorian Order.\nOthers who are made members of the RVO include the Royal Household’s head chef Christopher Tombling, the Royal Collection’s paper conservator Kathryn Stone, its paintings conservator Adelaide Izat, and David Foy, stud groom at the royal paddocks at Hampton Court Palace.\nRishi Sunak said: “The New Year’s Honours List recognises the exceptional achievements of people across the country and those who have shown the highest commitment to selflessness and compassion.\n“To all honourees, you are the pride of this country and an inspiration to us all.”\nRelated Topics Justin Welby, King Charles III, King Charles III coronation, New Year's Honours List, Westminster Abbey, The Royal Family",

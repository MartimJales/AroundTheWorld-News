Among them is boxing sensation Gervonta Davis, who recently announced his conversion to Islam. Gervonta Davis joins a list of notable American athletes who have converted to Islam over the years.\nIslam is one of the world’s largest faith traditions with more than 1.8 billion followers worldwide, making it the second-largest religion on the planet,\nReligion Unplugged reported.\nHere are five athletes who switched their faith.\nMuhammad Ali is perhaps the most famous athlete conversion to Islam, Ali embraced the faith in the 1960s. He changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali and used his platform to advocate for civil rights and social justice,\nReligion Unplugged reported.\nThe\nformer heavyweight champion converted to Islam in 1992 while serving time in prison.

Influenced by the civil rights movement and figures like Malcolm X, Abdul-Jabbar found solace and purpose in Islam.\n“Much of my early awakening came from reading ‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X’ as a freshman. I was riveted by Malcolm’s story of how he came to realize that he was the victim of institutional racism that had imprisoned him long before he landed in an actual prison. That’s exactly how I felt: imprisoned by an image of who I was supposed to be,” Jabbar wrote in an article for\nAl-Jazeera about his faith.

I just want to put that as a foundation.”\nWorld-renowned boxer Davis, hailing from Baltimore, recently made headlines by converting to Islam in a ceremony at a Maryland mosque. Imam Hassan Abdi, who presided over the ceremony at Masjid Al-Hidaayah in Woodlawn, shared that Davis performed the shahada, the Islamic testimony of faith, and adopted the Muslim name Abdul Wahid, meaning “the servant of the one.”\nAbdi described Davis as a down-to-earth person who engaged in a meaningful conversation about striving to be the best version of oneself as a human being. Their dialogue centered on faith and personal growth, ultimately leading Davis to take the next steps in embracing Islam,\nThe Baltimore Banner reported.\nGervonta Davis, photo via Instagram, @gervontaa",

    "text": "Venus transiting into Sagittarius wishes you exceedingly today, so you should not remain modestly in the background, but say what you desire and what few will be able to deny you.\nin him\nYou take the advice of those around you and finally get a little better. Even if you are a woman, it does not detract from your beauty, on the contrary. Finally, you won’t be afraid to present and sell your skills well, either in the work field or in the private, relational field.\nBull\nYou should realize that not everything can be done in a few minutes or hours. At least try to make the activities that you don’t enjoy more pleasant, for example with carols or dreaming, if possible. Don’t disdain any help either, especially if you’ll be done faster.\nGemini\nWhen you look in the mirror today, you might finally decide to try a crash course in positive thinking, and instead of looking for flaws and dark circles, you’ll smile at yourself and treat yourself to a happy thought. It will be worth it.\nRak\nAttention, now this is a professional matter that comes rarely. Don’t just rely on favors coming from others and actively contribute yourself. The Sun in the sign of Capricorn will help you get quality\nbusiness connections, from which unprecedented money will flow. CUSTOM ANNUAL HOROSCOPE!This horoscope will be your faithful guide throughout the year 2024. Secure a better future today!Individual processing according to the exact date and time of birth! About 50 A4 pages, quality book binding, beautiful design.\nLev\nThose who don’t get lazy get green. Especially now in winter, you have to do twice as much, but your achievements will be all the more valuable. The stars will grade you with excellence and send you into your life an award for your efforts. They manage to win unexpectedly or something else positive.\nPanna\nLately you have and will have enough finances. Let’s say even a considerable excess of money that cannot be spent in a reasonable way of life. The unreasonable ones, however, better not try it and think about what would be the best way to invest.\nScales\nLearn to also look at the social layers below you, not so that you can look down on someone, but because you might figure out how to help them up. And you will also see that you should be grateful for what is coming to you financially right now.\nScorpio\nYou don’t like generally laced relationships and conditions. But now you can enjoy a relaxed atmosphere at the workplace and in your home environment. Nobody tries to play the general, and if they do, it’s more for the amusement of others, but not really.\nMONTHLY TAROT FOR JANUARY!Are you wondering what you can look forward to in the first month of the new year? Find out now with your January Monthly Tarot!\nShooter\nYou have no patience today and will get annoyed by various meaningless orders from all possible quarters, from your boss to your relatives to your partner. You will then spend a lot of time on various everyday misunderstandings, which you could use much better. It takes some thinking.\nCapricorn\nVenus transiting into Sagittarius wishes you exceedingly today, so you should not remain modestly in the background, but say what you desire and what few will be able to deny you. You are charming and you know it. So you definitely don’t have to worry about your self-confidence.\nAquarius\nYour family has such a patron in you that protects the family hearth. You share all the troubles with them, you remember every detail of their lives and you experience the pains of others as your own. Sometimes it’s busy at home, but you know how to make sure there’s no shortage of peace.\nThe fish\nToday you will look for a moment of peace for yourself and your plans. You need to clarify a few things and plan a few points to get a little closer to your dreams. The end of the year is just around the corner, so let’s know what you want to do next year and how you will go about it.\nTN.cz\n2023-12-28 23:00:00\n#Horoscope #Friday #December #Venus #wishes #today #TN.cz",

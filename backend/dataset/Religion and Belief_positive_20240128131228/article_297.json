    "text": "7 hours ago God’s Guidance Hi, I’m John Sorensen, President of Evangelism Explosion International, and you’re listening to Share Life Today. “Guide me, O Thou Great Jehovah, Pilgrim through a barren land.” The late Dr. D. James Kennedy would say these very words every morning before his feet hit the ground. In this season where we're making resolutions and goals for the next year, we need to ask ourselves...are we relying on the guidance of God? There are many snares, temptations, and difficulties out there. We desperately need Him and His direction! The Bible says in Proverbs, \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways, acknowledge Him, and He will direct your path.\" God keeps His promises! All He asks from us is that we trust Him. So before you write down your newest resolution, let me encourage you—pray for God's leading in your life. He will begin to give you opportunities to serve and love Him like never before—and through those, you can have opportunities to trust Him and share the Gospel with others.

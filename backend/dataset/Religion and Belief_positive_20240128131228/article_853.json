    "text": "Santa drops in for one last visit Published 7:35 On the Saturday before Christmas, there were still some children who hadn’t given Santa their wish list yet. That’s where the Darlington Heights Volunteer Fire Department stepped in to help. Letting the reindeer rest a bit more until the big night, Darlington agreed to drive Santa around to all the different parts of the community, for children and their families to meet and greet him. Leaving the station about 3:30 p.m., Darlington volunteers took Santa all the way down Morris Creek Road, all the way down Darlington Heights Road, Heights School Road, Milbank Road, down Five Forks Road and over to families on Stockton Road as well. “We had a great time riding around and greeting all of the many smiling faces!” Darlington staff said in a statement. “Some of you even got to hear Chief Tinsley perform his own Christmas melody remixes! And we know at least one community member is on the nice list. She was kind enough to stop and return his hat after he didn’t have it on quite right, and it got caught in the wind. All of us at Darlington Heights Volunteer Fire Department and Auxiliary wish you a Very Merry Christmas!”",

    "text": "MANGALURU: Pejawar Math pontiff Sri Vishwaprasanna Thirtha Swamiji, who is also the trustee of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Theerth Kshetra Trust, said that the activities of Rama Rajya Samiti will be expanded to all states across the nation. The seer said that there will be no special offerings (seva) at the Ram Janmabhoomi temple. \\\"Service to the nation will be the right offering to Sri Ram. Devotees may engage in activities for the welfare of the poor through Rama Rajya Samiti,\\\" the seer said on the sidelines of 'Pejawar Vishwesha Thirtha Namana' programme held at Kalkura Nivas in the city on Friday. \\\"The Rama Rajya Samiti will not accept donations. It is an opportunity for devotees to help the poor build houses and extend financial support as an offering to Rama. The main purpose of the samiti is to ensure that no one should be left without homes after the inauguration of a new temple in Ayodhya. I have already launched a campaign in Udupi, to help the poor build houses,\\\" he added.The seer asserted that there is no link between the opening of temples in Ayodhya and politics. \\\"As per the agreement, the temple will have to be completed within two-and-a-half years. However, due to technical reasons, it took three years for the construction. Though the work is not yet completed, it is ready for inauguration,\\\" he said. While the temple will be dedicated on January 22, devotees will be allowed to enter from the very next day. \\\"There will be four queues for devotees to enter the shrine and have darshan of Sri Ram. The temple will be open from 6am to 9pm. The temple will follow the ancient tradition of 'Ramananda Sampradaya' while conducting rituals,\\\" he said.To a query on controversies over the distribution of invitations regarding the inauguration of the shrine in Ayodhya, the seer said that the trust has not shown disparity. \\\"The venue has a seating capacity of 7,000 people. Hence, it is not possible to invite everyone,\\\" he added.",

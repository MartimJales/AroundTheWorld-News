    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, Dec 29, 2023 / 16:10 pm Christmas is a time of reconciliation. God himself chose to become a man, coming into the world to save fallen humanity and reconcile it with himself. Christmas represents a dramatic break with conventional patterns and changes paradigms. Such is also the case of Zubair Simonson, a former Muslim who converted to Catholicism and shared his story recently with the [National Catholic Register](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/simonson-gaza-and-israel-and-peace), CNA’s sister news partner. “Hatred consumes. The loathing of a perceived enemy can be so consuming that one would rather see that enemy harmed than see a so-called ‘friend’ be saved,” Simonson noted, recalling his childhood, deeply affected by an upbringing that taught him to viscerally hate the Jews. Simonson grew up in the United States, a long way from the Holy Land. However, from a very young age he was introduced to a narrative of “oppressors” and “oppressed,” of a people who were entirely to blame and a people who never did anything reprehensible. “I’d heard it reinforced, time and again, at the mosque. I’d heard it reinforced, time and again, in the homes of family and friends,” he recalled.",

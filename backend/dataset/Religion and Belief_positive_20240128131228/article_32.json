    "text": "Welcome dear feline loving hoomans to the first collection of [hilarious cat memes](https://cheezburger.com/23055365/hilarious-wholesome-cat-memes-and-pics-to-cure-the-hump-day-grump) brought to you from the newly established church of cat. The first non-denominational church to put all of its faith in felines. And lets face it that is probably a goos idea considering how many times our [fluffy feline friends](https://cheezburger.com/23033349/fluffy-facetious-feline-memes-to-fill-you-with-feline-energy-for-the-week-ahead) have saved humanity over the years. From their role in taking down plague ridden rats, to their mystical meowgic in Ancient Egypt, to their critical role on the sail boats of yore, we do owe the feline kind a deep debt of gratitude. And it is hard to argue that their actions thus far have proven to be very god-like. Today we have been blessed by the visitation of various [feline disciples](https://cheezburger.com/22499333/the-cat-is-king-clawssic-cat-memes-to-remind-us-why-we-are-their-humble-servants). Feline Steve has come to spread his message that we are all that and a bag of chips, Feline Frank has come to regale us with tales of battle and Feline Bean who has just been named employee of the month at Gamer's Gauntlet have all come to spread their message of cat. [Sign up for our newsletter for a daily dose of hissterical cats and feel-good felines!](https://icanhascheezburger.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=web&utm_medium=intro&utm_campaign=marielintro) The church of cat is for all hoomans and animals who are ready to devote themselves to the teachings and learnings of the feline kind. The only requirements are regular offerings to evey cat you see, which is not too much of a commitment especially if you are already a feline pawrent. In the parable of Feline Felicia, we learn about the power of forgiveness and the struggle she had with Donald the Doggo. The tale tells us that the two had a dispute over who was the rightful owner of the spot on the couch. Their spat turned violent and soon Felicia scratched Donald. She felt very bad about this and immediately came back to give him an apology lick.

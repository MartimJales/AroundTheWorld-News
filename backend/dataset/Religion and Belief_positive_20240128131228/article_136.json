India Stack 1.0 focused on identification, payments, and data. India is exploring the possibility of creating India Stack 2.0, a 3D digital twin of the country. Digital twins, like the ones in Singapore, Barcelona, Zurich, and Helsinki, offer insights for urban planning and governance. They can be used for scenario planning, simulations, and predictive analysis. Digital twins can also help in disaster management and can be created by the private sector or by the government. The GIS & Remote Sensing Centre in Nagaland has already created digital twins, and Survey of India is partnering with Genesys to create digital twins of major cities in India.",

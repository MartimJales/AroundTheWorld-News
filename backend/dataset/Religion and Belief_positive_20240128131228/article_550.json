    "text": "A former Catholic bishop and president of St Malachy's College in Belfast has been described as \"utterly dedicated and faithful in his service of the Church\". Bishop Patrick Walsh passed away on Thursday in Nazareth Care Village in Belfast, where he had lived in his later years of retirement. Bishop of Derry and Apolostolic Administrator of Down and Connor Donal McKeown said the late Bishop Walsh was a cleric who had spoken \"words of faith-filled hope\" during the Troubles.

He was also Chairperson of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS).\" He continued: \"His personal commitment to Catholic education was well known and his robust defence of it will long be remembered. These early years of his priestly ministry taught Bishop Patrick that Catholic education, and the values it espouses, opens up incalculable opportunities for young people and assists the journey towards peace in a society often torn apart by violence and conflict.\" The Catholic clergyman continued: \"Ordained as an Auxiliary Bishop for the Diocese of Down and Connor in 1983, alongside Bishop Anthony Farquhar, whose funeral we celebrated just some weeks ago, these two faithfully served the diocese not only through the sacramental celebration of Confirmation but each played their own role in the peace process. \"Their years of episcopal ministry were marked by the many funerals of those who had lost their lives in the midst of conflict. Into that space, they spoke words of faith-filled hope, solidarity and challenge, faith-filled hope in the Risen Christ, solidarity with those who mourned the loss of loved ones and words of challenge to those entrusted with the process of peace-making. We should honour both their memories by strengthening our resolve to continue to take forward the peace process in Northern Ireland.\" Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp [Click this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LU5TE4vC7DOJ3M6yruB11W) or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

Bishop McKeown added: \"In 1991, Bishop Patrick was appointed as Bishop of Down and Connor and he was utterly dedicated and faithful in his service of the Church. Alongside his diocesan responsibilities, he was a member of various Irish Episcopal Commissions including Justice and Peace, and was a member of the Joint Bio-ethics Committee of the Episcopal Conference of England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, ardently seeking to protect human life from the moment of conception to its natural death.\" He continued: \"On the day of his episcopal ordination, a bishop chooses a motto upon which to model his life and ministry. Bishop Patrick chose Ex Animo Operari (\"To work with one’s heart\"), from Saint Paul’s Letter to the Colossians (Col. 3:24). In this passage, Saint Paul reminds us that, as Christians, it is Christ that we serve and that we will share, through Baptism, in Christ’s Death and Resurrection. As we give thanks to God for the years of ministry and service of Bishop Patrick Walsh, we entrust him to the heart of Christ. \"I commend his soul into the hands of God and pray that he may enjoy eternal rest.\" For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage [here](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/) and [sign up to our daily newsletter](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?view=Solus&mailingListId=1342b3be-3db3-461a-a6b4-c60bfcaa13da&utm_source=solusarticle) here",

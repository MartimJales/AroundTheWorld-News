A decidedly challenging year for her, who after giving up her grades, became a television personality in all respects, taking part in some of Canale 5’s best-known programs such as Verissimo and L’Isola dei Famosi. Born in Sicily in 1988, Cristina showed a great passion for singing from an early age, and in 2007, by a strange twist of fate, she played Sister Rosa, founder of the Ursulines of the Holy Family in the theater show The Courage to Love. Two years later she would begin her religious journey, spending the next two years of the novitiate in Brazil, before finally taking her vows in 2012, joining the Ursuline Sisters. The notoriety arrived in 2014, when she was selected by J-Ax at The Voice of Italy, finally managing to win the second edition of the transmission. She later took part in Dancing with the Stars in 2019 and then in Name that Tune and Guess my Age, before surprising everyone at the end of 2022, when she announced on Verissimo that she had given up her votes.

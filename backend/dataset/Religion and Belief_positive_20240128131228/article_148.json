    "text": "National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula has urged Kenyans to pray for President William Ruto and other government officials because “reviving the country’s economy is not as simple as it may appear.”\nMr Wetangula stressed that the challenges the country is currently facing require spiritual intervention.\nThe appeal comes amid difficulties faced by Kenyans including the high cost of living.\n“Pray for us leaders, including the President (William Ruto), his Deputy (Rigathi Gachagua), and myself, so that God may use us as vessels to resolve these challenges,” said Mr Wetangula.\nMr Wetangula further expressed his confidence that President Ruto had put in place robust strategies required to transform the lives of Kenyans.\nFormerly Bungoma Senator, Wetangula urged opponents of President Ruto’s regime to present innovative suggestions to challenge the government, contributing to the revitalization of the economy.\nDespite serving as former president Uhuru Kenyatta’s deputy for a decade, President Ruto maintains he inherited a dilapidated economy, making the task of revival challenging.\nWetangula has meanwhile also encouraged opposition members to develop creative policies while criticising the government to promote unity in the country.\nHe said: “As we usher in the new year (2024), I know President Ruto has plans to help improve the lives of Kenyans”.\n“God has blessed us; we had sufficient rainfall this year, resulting in abundant food. Next year, we anticipate having enough fertiliser to boost agricultural production.”\nIn early 2023, the William Ruto-led government launched a subsidised fertiliser program where a 50-kilogram bag was sold at Sh2,500, almost half its original price.\nThe farm input is distributed to farmers registered through a digital system.\nDespite increased agricultural production, Kenyans have been voicing concerns about the continually rising cost of living, especially after the government raised Value Added Tax (VAT) on petroleum products to 16 percent from 8 percent, and also introduced a number of levies to the payslip.\nAlso read: DPP consents to release of Sh400 million frozen Rwandan investors money\nKioni alleges plot to ‘illegally’ change the Constitution",

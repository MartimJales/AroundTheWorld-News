The group and 23 financial services companies – banks, brokerage firms, insurance and credit card companies – held a ceremony the same day to mark the occasion.\n“Our campaign with financial leaders has been in place for 13 years, spreading warmth around the country,” Commissioner Chang Man-hee said. “We express our deepest gratitude to those firms for making bigger efforts every year.”\nAt the ceremony Thursday, Lee Se-hoon, first senior deputy governor of the government financial watchdog, the Financial Supervisory Service, said his agency would back efforts to “spread a culture of giving back to the community.”\nMore from Headlines\n-\nAnother Trump presidency won’t affect US-South Korea joint nuclear deterrence: defense chief\n-\nKorea to launch new ‘digital nomad’ visa on Jan. 1\n-\nYoon appoints 4 ministers, broadcasting watchdog chief",

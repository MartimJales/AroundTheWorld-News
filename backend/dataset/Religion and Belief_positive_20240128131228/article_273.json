    "text": "Ayodhya’s modern ‘tent cities’ outshine luxury hotels; devotees to taste traditional dishes\nIn anticipation of the rising influx of global tourists ahead of the consecration programme of Lord Ram’s idol at the grand Ram Temple on January 22, the Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA) is actively working on setting up modern ‘tent cities’, aligning with the vision of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.\nThese tent cities of ADA offer luxury and semi-luxury suites designed for double occupancy, providing devotees with an opportunity to immerse themselves in the harmonious blend of mythological as well as modern Ayodhya amidst the serenity of nature.\nTent cities are becoming a medium to stay in ‘new grand Ayodhya’ for thousands of devotees.\nThe time for the consecration ceremony of Lord Ram’s idol at the grand Ram Temple is gradually approaching. It is expected that lakhs of devotees from all over the country and the world will flock to Ayodhya for the consecration ceremony.\nIn view of this and as per the wish of Chief Minister Adityanath, tent cities have been developed at various places by Shri Ram Mandir Teerth Kshetra Trust and Ayodhya Development Authority , officials said here on Thursday.\nA tent city is being established on 20-acre land at Majha Guptar Ghat to accommodate thousands of devotees. Another is being set up near Brahma Kund with 35 tents. Additionally, a tent city with 30 tents is being set up at Ram Katha Park.\nFurthermore, a 25-acre tent city is being established at Bag Bijaisi by the Tirth Kshetra Trust, providing accommodation for thousands of people. In addition to these, tent cities are also being set up in Karsewakpuram and Sri Maniram Das Chavni for the convenience of devotees.\nIn these tent cities that give the feel of ‘Heritage Cottage Stay’, devotees will get to taste all the flavours of the country, but the most distinctive ones will be the Awadhi and Banarasi flavours. The ADA has developed the tent city in Brahma Kund and Ram Katha Park through private partnership.\nThe tent city at Brahma Kund has been operational since December 1. Devotees staying here will be served millet dishes, ‘makki ki roti, sarson ka saag’ and seasonal vegetables.\nAdditionally, a variety of local dishes, including ‘Bajra Roti’ and other recipes,’Matar Ka Nimona’, ‘Bati-Chokha’ and ‘Moong Khichdi’ will also be served. Health-conscious people will also get the facility of detox water.\nPeople staying in the wooden deck-based tents will have all the facilities, including comfortable chairs, sofas, dining lounges, personal vaults, room heaters, air conditioning, high-speed internet, and luxurious interiors. Here, people will also have the convenience of a bonfire, an open-air theatre for cultural events, and a souvenir shop. These tents are durability-based and can be used for upto 10 years after installation.",

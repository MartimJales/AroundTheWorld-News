MAY THE NEW YEAR stop the production of those lethal bullets and shells which pierce the bodies of the innocent and helpless people, and bring rattling down the magnificent structures. MAY THE NEW YEAR infuse the boundless love for humanity in the hearts of those, who under the wrong belief of righteousness, enjoy tearing apart their own selves and other fellow beings in every part of the world. MAY THE NEW YEAR once again revive the man’s unshakable faith in the humanity, and see his deep-rooted malice , hatred, rancor and intolerance being replaced by an overflowing benevolence , empathy, love and tolerance. MAY THE NEW YEAR be blessed with the dawn of an era wherein ‘ humanitarianism’ might emerge as the supreme religion of the mankind.

    "text": "New Delhi: Away from the ongoing political row over invitations for the Pran Pratishtha event of Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22, thousands of Lord Ram devotees from all over the country are likely to throng Ayodhya for the mega-event. Among these Ram Bhakts, one is Shabnam Shaikh of Mumbai, who embarked on her journey to the UP town on foot from the country’s financial capital. Accompanied by her two friends Raman Raj Sharma and Vineet Pandey, Shaikh has set out to cover a distance of 1,425 km on foot before reaching Ayodhya to get a glimpse of Ram Lalla. Shaikh, who claims to be an ardent devotee of Lord Ram, said, “One does not need to be a Hindu to worship Lord Ram…he belongs to all.” View this post on Instagram On her way to Ayodhya from Mumbai, Shaikh often shares her videos and photos on social media platforms about the love and affection she has been getting from people. In a video, Shaikh is seen being welcomed by locals at Pimpalgaon near Nashik. In another video shared on Friday, Shaikh is heard urging people to gift her a vehicle so that she can carry other gifts which she has received from people on her way to Ayodhya. View this post on Instagram She said that she walks about 25-30km daily so that she could reach Ayodhya on or before January 22. Shaikh, whose videos are being widely shared on social, said with this journey, she also aims to change misconception that only men or boys can undertake such journeys. With the consecration ceremony scheduled to be held on January 22, construction work for the grand Ram Temple is currently under way in Ayodhya. A massive crowd is expected to congregate on Ayodhya close to the consecration ceremony and the city is getting decked up for the big day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Shri Ram International Airport and the redeveloped Ayodhya railway station on December 30. While the core of the newly built airport, located about 15 km from the main Ayodhya city, uses modern construction material, the facade of the terminal has been lent a traditional look as done in the new building of the Ayodhya station.

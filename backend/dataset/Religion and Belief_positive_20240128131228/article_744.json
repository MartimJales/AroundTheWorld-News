    "text": "2023-12-29 22:15:11\nChicago: Sacred Heart Canaanite Catholic Forona Church in Maywood, America’s first Canaanite church, is moving to Bensonville with a more convenient location.\nIt is owned by St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Bensonville, Diocese of Juliet. The new temple has a structure consisting of a church, school, priestly hall and a seven-quarter acre plot of land.\nThe new church has been acquired as part of the pastoral growth of Sacred Heart Knanaya Church established in Maywood in 2006. Ira’s big dream is being realized as a result of the parishioners’ prayers and generous financial support.\nJuliet Diocese Abhi: Ronald Hicks and Chicago Diocese Abhi: Mar Joy Allappat Father’s timely interventions and leadership are gratefully recalled.

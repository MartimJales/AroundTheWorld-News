    "text": "Opinion\nUtah State QB Leaves College Football to Become Navy SEAL: 'This Is Where God's Calling Me'\nAt the height of personal glory, a young man soon to become a husband thought only of God and service.\nAccording to\nKSL, quarterback Levi Williams of the Utah State Aggies announced Monday that he would forego his final season of college football eligibility in hopes of joining the Navy SEALs.\nWhen KSL ‚ÄúSports Zone‚Äôs‚Äù Hans and Scotty asked Williams how he explained his decision to his fiance ‚Äî whom he plans to marry on Mar. 15 ‚Äî the young quarterback cited the universe‚Äôs ultimate authority.\n‚ÄúThis is where\nGod‚Äôs calling me,‚Äù Williams recalled telling his soon-to-be wife. ‚ÄúObviously, we can‚Äôt prepare for everything. There‚Äôs going to be some unexpected turns along the way. As long you trust God and trust me, I think we‚Äôre gonna be alright.‚Äù\nThat attitude certainly helped explain how Williams has achieved success as a college quarterback.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\nOn Saturday, Williams led the Aggies to a 44-41, double-overtime\nvictory over the New Mexico Lobos. In that game, he accounted for five total touchdowns, including the game-winner on a broken play in the second overtime.\nThe victory gave the Aggies six wins on the season and made them eligible for a postseason bowl game.\nReaders can view the game‚Äôs final play here:\nUTAH STATE IS BOWL ELIGIBLE ON A WILD PLAY\n[@USUFootball] [pic.twitter.com/vZWiRuDL8I]\n‚Äî CBS Sports College Football üèà (@CBSSportsCFB)\n[November 25, 2023]\nMeanwhile, Williams‚Äô performance\nearned him the Mountain West Conference‚Äôs Offensive Player of the Week.\nIn light of his decision to work toward joining the\nSEALs, however, one suspects that Williams found more joy in his team‚Äôs accomplishment than in his own.\n‚ÄúWhat I love about [the SEAL‚Äôs] ethos and their motto is that no one guy is better than the other. It takes all of them to complete a mission. I think that‚Äôs super critical ‚Ä¶ Just to have the ability to be part of that brotherhood, it would be a great honor,‚Äù Williams told Hans and Scotty.\nThat perspective undoubtedly helped Williams think beyond his college\nfootball career.\n‚ÄúI love football, and it‚Äôs so great,‚Äù the quarterback said. ‚ÄúBut I knew that, eventually, it was going to come to an end.‚Äù\nAnd if you cannot be part of a football team forever, why not join a bigger team with an even nobler purpose?\n‚ÄúI just want to be in a spot where I can protect this great country where we get to play football with the freedom to do that. I think this is the best country in the world. So I‚Äôd like to keep it that way and protect it as long as I can,‚Äù Williams said.\nAs impressed as we are with Williams, the happiest people in this story have to be his future in-laws.\nAfter all, imagine your daughter finding an elite college athlete who thinks nothing of his personal accomplishments. Instead, he only wants to be a husband, serve his country and praise\nGod.\nThe U.S. Navy also should look forward to welcoming Williams into its family. While some commanders have gone nauseatingly\nwoke, the military as a whole remains an object of intense admiration for many Americans.\nIn fact, our entire experiment in republican self-government depends on people like Williams who voluntarily practice the\nChristian virtues of courage and humility. The experiment cannot survive otherwise.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

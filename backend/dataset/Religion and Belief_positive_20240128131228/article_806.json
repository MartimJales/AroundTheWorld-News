    "text": "Rabbis for Human Rights support beleaguered communities in West Bank Source: RHR This week saw Rabbis for Human Rights (RHR) working across the West Bank supporting Palestinian Communities in the Occupied Territories. RHR write: \"This week our Humanitarian Aid project provided emergency food boxes to families in need, with 160 boxes to herding communities in the Southern Jordan Valley, 70 boxes to farming communities around Nablus, 30 boxes to Bedouin tribes near the Dead Sea, and 60 boxes to communities in the Bethlehem region. This project is a vehicle for showing our solidarity with Palestinians who are suffering at this time, and the opportunity to provide much needed basic supplies. On the ground we are seeing the economic crisis developing into a catastrophe and are deeply concerned for the welfare of these communities. \"In addition to the economic concerns, there is a deeply unsettling rise in settler violence and army aggression. On Wednesday this week our activists in the Northern Jordan Valley were detained by the army, and the Palestinian shepherds they were accompanying were arrested. This was under false charges of walking into a firing zone. And all were released when the police arrived. During the hours of detention the activists and herders could see settler youth grazing their flocks in the same area, but they were not apprehended by the army. With the New Year comes the beginning of the planting season and a series of Planting Justice events. Starting from January 5th until January 26th we will go out every Friday to plant trees with Palestinian communities in the Occupied Territories and in the Unrecognized Villages in the Negev. These communities are suffering during the war, and we have seen a major increase in settler violence and damage to agriculture. We will come together in solidarity, Israelis and Palestinians, to support and strengthen each other, and to plant trees as a symbol of hope in a shared, just and peaceful future for us all.\" LINKS Click [HERE.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyX4-TSFNaHx76hhLvmpMATnE9mATLSJJXxZN_XinlMLYUKA/viewform) to sign up for one of our planting events, or forward to Israeli and Palestinian friends so that they might join us!

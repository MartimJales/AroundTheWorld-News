    "text": "2023-12-30 02:15:35\n“It is important to me to listen to the people of Wegberg, to absorb and understand their problems and their ideas. When many people come together and get involved, you can achieve a lot. That’s why I wanted to use the opportunity to have so many citizens as guests directly for our hometown. That’s how the idea of collecting donations came about,” says Christian Pape. The mayoral candidate donated fries from Moorshoven, WegBURGER with meat from Dalheim, prepared in a food truck from Klinkum, and drinks during his talks. Anyone who wanted could return the favor with a donation to “Wegberg Helps eV”.\n“We chose Wegberg Helps because the association supports very different people who need our help with great volunteer commitment,” says Pape. In the end, a sum was raised that both the association and the independent mayoral candidate had not even remotely expected. The amount collected was rounded up to an impressive 6,000 euros!\nThis sum will now go equally to organizations that support children, young people and families in Wegberg. These are the Dalheim Children’s Village, the Neukirchen Arsbeck Educational Association, Famcare Rickelrath and the SKFM mother and child residential community in Klinkum.\nHeinz Kohlen, Volkmar Kriegs and Tobias vom Dorp accepted the donation on behalf of the “Wegberg Helps eV” association: “We are very grateful for this enormous sum in times when there is a lot of need and we would like to help in many places.”\nChristian Pape emphasizes: “These donations all come from Wegberg and now benefit Wegbergers. This shows what we can achieve if we tackle it together.”\nIn January/February, the independent mayoral candidate will be out with the food truck again – then in downtown Wegberg. He will also be asking for donations at this event. These will benefit the “Sankt Martin Helps” association.\n#Christian #Pape #hands #donation #euros #Wegberg #helps",

Also, for peace in Palestine,” he told Bernama when contacted.\nIn PAHANG, thousands of worshippers at the Tepian Putra Mosque in Kuantan performed the prayer of need led by the second imam, Muhamad Faizuddin Abdul Nasri.\nThe Friday sermon also reminded worshippers to assist each other during the flood season.\nMeanwhile, in PENANG, a check by Bernama found that several mosques around Tasek Gelugor also performed the solat hajat after the Friday prayer.\nDeputy Chief Minister I Datuk Mohamad Abdul Hamid, who is also Penang Islamic Religious Council president, said: “There is no specific directive regarding this matter, but we encourage mosques or prayer halls to conduct the prayer for the well-being of all, especially the flood victims in several states at this time.”\nIn MELAKA, a Bernama survey at the An-Naim Mosque in Durian Tunggal witnessed nearly 1,500 worshippers reciting Qunut Nazilah.\nA congregant, Abdul Razak Ibrahim, said that even without prayer of need, he believes worshippers in any mosque in Melaka or the country would always pray for the well-being of those affected by the floods.\nYesterday, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Dr Mohd Na’im Mokhtar encouraged mosques and surau across the country to hold solat hajat for the safety and well-being of the country and all flood victims.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

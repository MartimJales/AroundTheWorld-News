    "text": "Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists come together in Natore for Christmas, the feast of harmony\nCelebrations transcended boundaries of faiths in an atmosphere of forgiveness, peace, and reconciliation. A Muslim shared songs and food, as his Christian friend did earlier for the Islamic holiday of Eid. Official mentions the role played in local development by PIME missionaries, still remembered with affection by the community.\nNatore (AsiaNews) – Christmas was marked by interfaith harmony and sharing with members of different religions united to celebrate the joy of the birth of Jesus in Natore, a district in Rajshahi Division, experiencing moments of intense participation in the name of rebirth, new beginnings, forgiveness, and peace in a country that once experienced sectarian tensions.\nTrees adorned with lights and decorations illuminated the surroundings, accompanied by special prayers in churches and Christmas carols and hymns of joy in Christian homes.\nThe celebration crossed religious boundaries with members of the Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist communities united in stressing that \"Christmas is a universal celebration.\"\nRobiul Islam, a young Muslim from Natore, spoke to AsiaNews about his experience. \"I joined the Christmas party with my friend Jonathan Gomes. We sang Christmas carols, enjoyed delicious food, including the Christmas cake,” he said. Stressing the strong bond between faiths, he said that Jonathan had previously participated in Eid (Islamic) celebrations with his family.\nOn Christmas Day, the parish of Bonpara, Natore, organised a convivial moment after the Mass with local Christians sharing Christmas cake and songs with people of different faiths.\nSiddiqur Rahman Patwari, a Muslim leader and member of Parliament, as well as other political leaders, attended the event, bringing greetings to the Catholic community.\nPatwari expressed gratitude to the missionaries from the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME) for their major role in local development. He also highlighted local religious harmony, expressing hope that it would continue in the future.\nIt should be noted that PIME priests and nuns from Italy served in the parish of Bonpara for many years. And their contribution, a local resident pointed out, is still remembered with affection by the Christians and non-Christians alike.\nOn Christmas, Bangladeshi President Mohammed Sahabuddin and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also extended their greetings to the Christian community.\nThe president hosted a reception at the Bangabhaban, his official residence, in the presence of Archbishop Bejoy N D' Cruze of Dhaka and Christian Association of Bangladesh President Nirmol Rozario, as well as other community representatives, diplomats and religious leaders from various countries.\nThe head of state urged everyone to work for the well-being of the country and its people, stressing that religion is a personal matter and that, at the national level, it is necessary to support harmony and the free practice of worship.\nLastly, he praised Christ's example for all faiths in leading people to truth, justice, and peace, working to make the world a peaceful place.\nFor his part, Card Patrick D'Rozario, Archbishop Emeritus of Dhaka, released a message for Christmas.\n\"Celebrating Christmas during the upcoming election is a grace from God and a call to embrace the challenge,” the message reads.\nIn it, the cardinal also offered prayers to encourage people to bring the message of Christmas to the electoral process, and to choose leaders committed to justice, peace, and harmony, wishing everyone \"a fruitful Christmas and a new year full of grace.\"\nAs Indonesia stops for Eid al-Fitr, Catholics extend best wishes and show friendship\n05/06/2019 18:08",

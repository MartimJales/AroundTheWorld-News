    "text": "Status: 29.12.2023, 16:00 PM\nBy: Michaele Heske\nCommentsPrint Share\nHans Hauder died at the age of 97. © Private\nWith a positive philosophy of life, Hans Hauder from Dorfen has turned 97 years old. Now he has passed away.\nDorfen – Hans Hauder has died at the age of 97. \"He was a happy person, always content,\" says his widow Rosa Hauder, full of deep sorrow for her husband, with whom she had been connected since her early youth.\nUntil recently, Mr. and Mrs. Hauder were often seen strolling through Dorfen, regular walks along the Schäfflergasse were part of the daily program. Despite his advanced age, Hans Hauder did not want to rest. The former car master, who founded the Hauder driving school in 1956, has helped a good part of the people of Dorfen to get their driver's license. On 19 December, death unexpectedly slowed down the native of Dorfen. A few days after a fall in which he broke his tailbone, he died in hospital. \"We didn't expect that, he was already on the road to recovery,\" says his wife.\nIn his free time, Hauder liked to ride his bicycle, and his wife Rosa was always at his side. Sometimes they even cycled all the way to Munich and back. The home-bound couple liked it best at home. \"The garden was his great hobby,\" says Rosa Hauder. The Isen flows right past – his paradise. \"I found the best hours in my home,\" she quotes her late husband.\nHans Hauder has a life full of work behind him. But also full of \"massel\", as he emphasized again and again. Although he went completely blind ten years ago, he never quarreled with his fate. \"I could also be grumpy,\" he often said, \"but then I'm grumpy and still blind.\" This describes his philosophy of life: to see only the good, to always be patient. It was important to him to live together peacefully, he didn't like arguments.\nHis heart was particularly attached to his wife Rosa, whom he saw almost every day at the age of 13 on his way to an apprenticeship at Opel Forster in front of the former Soafa, her parents' inn – he regularly waved to her and married her in 1952. \"I've got a very good woman, my greatest luck,\" he said just over a year ago at the Iron Wedding. The loving father was just as attached to his daughter Sigrid Hubatius von Kottnow, his granddaughter Eva-Maria and the great-grandson Elias.",

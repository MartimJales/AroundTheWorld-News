    "text": "The Gospel Music Association will open a museum and hall of fame in spring 2025 in downtown Nashville. To be called the Dove Center, the facility will take space in a mixed-use building anchored by Lipscomb University’s Spark Campus and which previously housed cafe The Well. The address is [147 Fourth Ave. N.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/147+4th+Ave+N,+Nashville,+TN+37219/@36.1625289,-86.7786969,20z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8864665908ad9287:0x3898b55689734587!8m2!3d36.1626887!4d-86.7786332!16s%2Fg%2F11bw40dvk1?entry=ttu) The nonprofit recently released a video with some images and basic details of the future cultural facility. An image shows multiple spaces, including those to accommodate a Dove Awards Theater, a stage and offices. In addition, the Dove Center — with a [main entrance](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.1620926,-86.7786959,3a,75y,14.59h,102.85t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sRo9Az5PNaLE6fLrv1dJCYg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DRo9Az5PNaLE6fLrv1dJCYg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D64.437096%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) to face Commerce Street — will feature themed spaces such as Lift Your Voice, Creating for a Higher Power and Divine Inspiration. Jackie Patillo, GMA president, could not be reached for comment. \"Developed to preserve the history legacy of our past, support the impact of today's artists, and plant seeds for the future, we believe the Dove Center will be a ... key part of the GMA's mission to expose, promote and celebrate the gospel through music,\" Patillo says in the video. To date, the Gospel Music Association has offered no permanent museum and hall of fame facility, though its website references a hall of fame and event space, started in 1971, located in Music Row. No address is given. An LLC affiliated with Nashville commercial real estate company Eakin Partners owns the building, which also includes a parking garage. The company paid $6.65 million for the modernist structure in 2009, Metro records show. According to Eakin Partners, the GMA will sublease the space from Lipscomb. Jason Holwerda, a partner with the local office of Orlando, Fla.-based Foundry Commercial, represented the GMA in the lease deal. Founded in 1964 by the late J.D. Sumner, the GMA operates its headquarters at 4012 Granny White Pike. The association's hall of fame members include Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Amy Grant, Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, Michael W. Smith, the Fisk Jubilee Singers and The Winans. In 2017, Lipscomb launched its first graduate business classes via the university’s Spark initiative. The 20,100-square-foot space is located on the main level of the building's southeast corner (and in a space adjacent to the future GMA facility). Spark launched in Cool Springs in November 2012 and ceased operations in Williamson County in 2022 (read [here](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/development/lipscomb-will-not-renew-lease-on-spark-cool-springs-center/article_cc42932c-fc9c-5569-be68-ccf12bfe86eb.html)). Downtown is home to five music museums: the Country Music Museum and Hall of Fame, the Johnny Cash Museum, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, the National Museum of African American Music and the Patsy Cline Museum. The Glen Campbell Museum closed earlier this year and will relocate, according to its website, to a space for which the address has not yet been announced. A downtown museum and bar devoted to George Jones closed in 2021.

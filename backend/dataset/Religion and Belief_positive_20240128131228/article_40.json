    "text": "2023-12-29 00:32:50\nChristmas Celebration at Chicago Sacred Heart Canaan Catholic Forona Church\nThis yearâ€™s Christmas was a truly special experience at the Sacred Heart Canaan Catholic Forona Church in Chicago. The church, which is preparing to move to a new location, had a special celebration honoring ten children who were celebrating Christmas for the first time in their lives.\nVicar Fr. Thomas Mulavan played a key role in making the celebration memorable by giving special gifts to the children. The ten children who were specially honored at the church were Elisa Thannikukhippil, Ivana Thakitiel, Sara Mooket, Itan Kunnumpura, Evelyn Palaghat, Ava Ayikaparampil, Leah Cheruvil, Maryam Nedunthuruthil, Arol Pullorkunnel, and Jonah Mutholam.\nThe church community came together to make the first Christmas for these children truly unforgettable. The parishioners contributed to the joyous occasion by providing support and love to the children. The church was filled with love and laughter as everyone celebrated the spirit of Christmas and the joy of giving.\nAs the Chicago Sacred Heart Canaan Catholic Forona Church prepares to move to a new location, this Christmas celebration will always hold a special place in the hearts of both the parishioners and the honored children. It was a true reflection of the Christmas spirit and the importance of coming together as a community to spread love and joy, especially during the holiday season.\n#Christmas #Chicago #Blessed #Babies",

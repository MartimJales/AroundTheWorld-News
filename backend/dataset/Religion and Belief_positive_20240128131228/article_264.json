    "text": "Don’t Miss Those Sweet Moments\n“But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love;\nfor you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.”Psalm 59:16\nOnce my morning caregivers (I call them my “get-up girls”) have me dressed and sitting up, once I’ve finished breakfast and am ready to head out the door, my friends and I take an important pause. We head for our favorite warm spot—the bay window seat in my bedroom, which looks out over my backyard and the San Gabriel Mountains beyond. It’s one warm spot that invites sitting and lingering. In that cozy corner, the three of us open a hymnbook to harmonize together over some beautiful old hymns.\nSafeguarding a quiet moment, admiring God’s creation, and giving\nGod pleasure each morning with our song warm the soul as well as the body. Don’t be in such a hurry with life that you rush past those warm, quiet places where you meet with the Lord. The peace and perspective that come from those few sweet moments will color the rest of your day.\nFather, the Bible tells how you met with Adam and Eve in the Garden, in the cool of the day. (Genesis 3:8). I imagine there were warm, quiet places in Eden where you loved to talk to our first parents. Help me to find those moments in my day. Please don’t let me hurry past places and times where you seek fellowship with me.\nLiving in God’s Love: A Call to Christian Community\nKay Toombs, a Christian, professor, and author who lives with disability, returns to the podcast to explore the transformational power of intentional Christian community. Over decades living with multiple sclerosis (MS), Kay has reflected and taught on issues related to illness, disability, caregiving, and healing, as well as the role Christianity can play in creating a sustainable culture and caring communities.",

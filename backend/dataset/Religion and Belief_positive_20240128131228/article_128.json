    "text": "RSS chief Dr. Mohan Bhagwat shows Sankardev’s way to eliminate social evils RSS chief Dr. Mohan Bhagwat said that all social evils could be eliminated through benevolence, the way Shrimant Shankardev exemplified in his noble life by bringing social reforms. OUR BUREAU MAJULI/DIBRUGARH: RSS chief Dr. Mohan Bhagwat said that all social evils could be eliminated through benevolence, the way Shrimant Shankardev exemplified in his noble life by bringing social reforms. \"We all have to eliminate the evils within our society through benevolent behaviour the way Shrimant Shankardev exemplified in his noble life by bringing social reforms,\" he said. The RSS chief said this today at the Poorvottar Sant Manikanchan Sammelan, 2023, North Kamalabari Xatra in Majuli. The main objective of the conference was to pursue coordination, goodwill, and harmony among different Sanatan spiritual traditions and communities. There was a unanimous call for mutual cooperation towards this mission at the Sammelan. After a long gap since Jorhat Sant Sammelan in 1966, the Poorvottar Sant Manikanchan Sammelan is being held in Majuli. [Dr. Bhagwat](https://www.sentinelassam.com/topheadlines/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-arrives-for-majuli-visit-in-assam-683359) said that \"every person has a particular nature; similarly, every nation has its own unique way of life, and the nature of the nation is derived from its culture. The'sanskruti' of Bharat is reflected through 'Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti' (truth is one, but it is revealed by intellectuals differently). This all-inclusive tradition exists only in Bharat. Dr. Bhagwat also stressed that in today's crucial period, Bharat has to stand firm to give this message of peace and coexistence to the whole world. To fulfil this noble task of Bharat, the revered spiritualists and Sants will have to come forward in our society.\". \"We all have the same ancestors; we also all have the same values, and we all have to take our unity forward while adhering to our diversity. Unity is not uniformity, but it is unionness,\" said Dr. Bhagwat. He also said that \"we have to try hard to make our society self-reliant through service, education, healthcare, and employment.\". Dr. Bhagwat said that there is a great need for national awareness in families to upkeep Bharat's eternal spiritual values and time-tested customs. He requested all the dharmacharyas (religious gurus) and their Maths and temples to do the work of conveying this great message of Bharat and her best spiritual values to the new generation. A total of 104 xatradhikars belonging to 48 xatras and 37 different religious institutions and sects from all over the Northeastern states were present. The prominent among Xatradhikars and Dharmacharyas from Northeast Bharat include Sri Chittaranjan Maharaj from Shantikali Ashram of Tripura, Sri Janardan dev Goswami of North Kamlabari Xatra, Sri Sri Xatradhikar Prabhu from Auni Aati Satra, Dakshin Pat Satra, Garh Mool Satra, Sri Sundaria Xatra of Barpeta, Pramukh Bhonte from Namsai Bodhi Vihar, Pramukh Mahant of Parshuram Kund, Arunachal Pradesh, religious leaders from Shrimant Shankardev Sangh, Daloi Shri Puramon Kinjin of Jayantiya Pahad, Meghalaya, Jheliang Rong Hararkka, Bodo Bali Batho Samaj, Rajashree Bhagyachandra Foundation, Manipur, Lakhiman Sangh, Karbi Anglong, Kargu Gamgi Samaj, Arunachal and Assam Sattra Mahasabha, and others were present at today's sammelan. The two-day visit of Sarsanghchalak Dr. Mohan Bhagwat will come to an end tomorrow after he addresses a public meeting in Majuli.

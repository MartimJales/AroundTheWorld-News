    "text": "DECATUR, ILL. (WAND) - Shemilah Outreach is no stranger to the Decatur community, and the man behind it all is like family to local youth. \"There are not many people like him that wants to make people better and bring up our generation,\" said Jamareon Singleton, member of Shemilah Outreach. Shemuel Sanders started his program in honor of his daughter Shemilah after she fell victim to gun violence. Now, Sanders is dedicated to guiding kids and teens down the right path. \"Sky is the limit. I tell the youth if they stay on the right path, stay out of trouble. Then they can do what they want to do, be who they want to be,\" said Shemuel Sanders. In 2023, Sander's goal was to expand, and that is exactly what he did. Along with adding various activity rooms in the outreach center. Including a teen room with a PS5 gaming system, a weight room and arcade games lined up and down the hall. He even added a computer lab, so his students can do homework before getting into any of the activities. \"You come here he'll feed you, give you a game system. Just make sure your home works done and be on the right track,\" said Zander Martin, program participant.

Each providing different outlets for students with different interests. \"We have different students; they have different ideals and different things that they want to do. I want to give them things they can chose from. Our violence prevention program, we have an awesome sports program, agriculture program, art program. So we have really grown,\" explained Sanders. With gun violence growing across the nation and in the community, Sanders is able to work closely with the youth who become impacted. \"Losing my cousin, that was a big impact on my life. Because just being there, seeing it happen. Especially at her young age. A lot of people kind of lose themselves, but I didn't want to do that to my mom or my family. So having Mr. Sanders, it was a good help,\" said Singleton. At the end of this year, Sanders is looking back at not only his work, but the impact he's made on the youth. Like two of his students who have been a part of the program since 7th grade. Now they're graduating high school early. \"That definitely was an impact on my high school career. And graduating early, that's a blessing,\" said Martin. \"I learned a lot actually. Landscaping, leadership skills,\" said Singleton. Sanders has even more plans to continue to expand in 2024. He hopes to find a gym for students to use in his program. Sanders thanks the City of Decatur and the Decatur community for their ongoing support.

    "text": "Saddle up for a trip through entertainment history with a weekly highlight from Santa Clarita’s Walk of Western Stars! This week, “The Duke” himself, John Wayne! Born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, in Winterset, Iowa, the man who would be [John Wayne](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm 78/) moved with his family to Palmdale, California and then later to Glendale, where he would graduate high school. It was in Glendale that Wayne picked up the nickname “Little Duke,” as he never went anywhere without the family’s pet Airedale terrier, Duke. Wayne went on to play football and study pre-law at the University of Southern California (USC), until a broken collarbone led to the loss of his scholarship. It was through this USC connection that Wayne would break his way into the film industry, starting his career as an extra for director John Ford. Ford would direct one of Wayne’s breakout roles in the film [Stagecoach](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/community-news/who-was-buster-trow-unearthing-memories-of-a-forgotten-silver-screen-horse-whisperer-489854) (1939), and the two would go on to collaborate in 14 total movies. In 1999, Wayne was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest male stars in American cinema. Wayne died on June 11, 1979, of stomach cancer. Wayne was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by President Jimmy Carter. Where is John Wayne’s Walk of Western Stars plaque? Honored in 1984, and appearing in over 170 films, Wayne remains a cultural icon with his roles as the quintessential American hero, including such films as Iwo Jima (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), and True Grit (1969). Wayne’s plaque on the Walk of Western Stars can be found on Main Street (east side) just south of 8th Street.

    "text": "Amy Huberman was in a humourous mood as she wished her son Ted a happy birthday on social media.\nWhile Christmas was likely busier for her husband Brian O'Driscoll the couple made sure to make their youngest child's big day online in their own way.\nToday's top videos\n'My youngest housemate is 3,' Amy, 44, began in a funny tribute to her son on his birthday as she posted a picture of a big metallic blue balloon in the shape of the number three.\nAmy Huberman's birthday tribute to her son. Pic: Amy Huberman/Instagram 'Even though he never has keys, never replaces the milk in the fridge, wakes the rest of the housemates in the middle of the night,' she continued, 'he knows how to rock a loose curl and a button nose and that’s the main thing.'\nDad Brian was a man of few words marking his son's transition from babyhood to toddler by sharing a picture of the birthday balloon with a simple caption of his name and a love hearts emoji and underneath he added a baby face emoji with an arrow pointing to an emoji of a kid's face.\nPic: Brian O'Driscoll/Instagram Young Ted received plenty of birthday wishes via Amy's post, with numerous comments celebrating the special day.\n'Please kiss the birthday boy from me,' Lucy Kennedy wrote and Deirdre O' Kane simply said 'TED,' followed by a flurry of hearts and applauding emojis.\nBrian O'Driscoll and Amy Huberman at the World Rugby Awards. Pic: Amy Huberman/Instagram Author Norma Sheahan joked: 'That lad will do so well! He’s been dragged up.'\nAmy and Brian, who have been married since 2010, also share their son Billy and daughter Sadie so no doubt Christmas is an exciting time of year in their home.\nDon't worry Amy, looks like Ted has the makings of a great housemate! Happy Birthday to Ted from all of us at EVOKE !",

'Damn, I look good,' Take that Tito's!\" he said with a laugh. \"But for anybody that's thinking about it, if they want to lose weight and you do drink, let me tell you, it does help tremendously if you stop.\"\nThe \"Last Night Lonely\" singer then teased on the show that although he gave up alcohol, his sweet tooth is still his weakness.\n\"I love me some ice cream,\" he quipped. \"I'm like, 'Well, I'm not drinking. I better get this Twix candy ice cream.’ Coffee ice cream. So good.\"\nAlthough Pardi didn’t give anymore insight on his sobriety journey, he noted that he’s not sure if he’ll stay committed to it.\n\"I'm retired, OK?

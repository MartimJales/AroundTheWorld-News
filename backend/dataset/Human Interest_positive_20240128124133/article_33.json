    "text": "Tasmanian yacht Alive is in the box seat to take out Sydney to Hobart overall honours, with skipper Duncan Hine confident the 66-footer has a winning time on the board.\nHine and his crew finished the 628-nautical-mile blue water classic on Thursday afternoon as clubhouse leaders on handicap time.\nAlive was one of just six yachts to have crossed the River Derwent finish line by Thursday night, with more than 80 still at sea.\nAlive is no stranger to success, having claimed the overall win in 2018 and fourth spot in 2019.\n“It’s a waiting game,” Hine said.\n“We’re looking good though. I believe we could do it again, but the reality may be different.\nAdvertisement “Now we wait with bated breath to see if anyone can beat our time.”\nAlive was one of just six yachts to have crossed the River Derwent finish line by Thursday night, with more than 80 still at sea.\nIts biggest threat appears to be another Tasmanian yacht, Kraken 111 - the two-handed entrant must finish by 7.09pm on Friday to top Alive’s mark.\nThe overall winner, which is awarded the Tattersall Cup, is judged on handicap, which takes into account factors including the size of the boat.\nSupermaxi LawConnect claimed the first-past-the-post line honours on Thursday morning in the second-closest finish in Sydney to Hobart history.\nLawConnect came from behind to beat fellow 100-footer and 2022 winner Andoo Comanche by just 51 seconds.\nAdvertisement Skipper and owner Christian Beck, who won line honours for the first time, said it was a dream finish aided by a breeze at the right moment.\nComanche had the lead heading into the River Derwent, but LawConnect proved better in light winds.\nThere was added drama when a spectator boat passed close to Comanche near the finish line.\nPolice subsequently said action would be taken against a 57-year-old male skipper of a private vessel for allegedly encroaching into an exclusion zone against safety regulations.\nComanche skipper John Winning Jr told the ABC the incident didn’t cost his yacht the race.\n“I wouldn’t have it any other way, I wish there were 500 of them [spectators],” he said.\nAdvertisement “It’s even, everyone gets the same thing. If they were ahead of us, they would have had the wash, but unfortunately, we got the wash.”\nFourteen of the starting fleet of 103 have retired, including supermaxi SHK Scallywag.\nAAP\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare Introducing your Newsfeed\nFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.\nFind out more\nRead More Sydney to Hobart\nYachting\nSponsored Advertisement Latest In Sport Fetching latest articles\nMost Viewed In Companies",

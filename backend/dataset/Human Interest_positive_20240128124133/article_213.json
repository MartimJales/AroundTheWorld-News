    "text": "Tribune News Network\nDoha\nDefending champions Qatar are determined to match up to their showing of 2019, when they won the AFC Asian Cup, in the upcoming 18th edition of the continental championship, stated Al Annabi coach Marquez Lopez.\nThe Spaniard is also happy with the way the Qatar national team is preparing for the tournament which begins January 12 and will last till February 10 at the FIFA World Cup Qatar stadiums.\n“I am happy with the determination players are showing during the training sessions. I am very happy with the way the preparations are going on at this moment,” Lopez, who replaced Carlos Queiroz as Qatar coach, told the local media on the sidelines of the training camp.\nQatar are to play two friendlies against Cambodia on December 31 and later vs Jordan on January 5 in Doha as part of their preparations for the AFC Asian Cup 2023.\n“I have great confidence in everyone, and although time is limited before the tournament, we will work with all our strength and try to reach the best preparation,” stressed Lopez.\n“The friendlies are important as these games will give us good opportunity to attain readiness.”\n“Pressure is there in football and it is important for the players to enjoy the moments. If there is no enjoyment of the game, then why do we play in the first place,” he added.\nOn the focus being on Qatar as reigning champions, Lopez said: “We are the title holders and certainly this is a great responsibility for the team and all the players. We will go step by step as this is a big challenge. We will first think about winning the first match,” he said.“Our first goal is to make the Qatar fans happy, and without a doubt their support for the team will give us great motivation and additional strength.”\nLopez who was recently given the responsibility of managing the Qatar national team had been busy with the Qatar Stars League as coach of Al Wakrah.\nOn his new role, he said, “This is a good opportunity for me after a long career with Al Wakrah. I believe in my mentality and style. I am not new to the national team and I know all the players well.”\n Copy 29/12/2023 10",

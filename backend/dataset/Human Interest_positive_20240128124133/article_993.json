    "text": "Take a drive through B.C. and you’ll be greeted with the beauty of nature’s playground. It’s no secret that the province provides bountiful natural beauty, so much so that the province’s license plate reads: Beautiful B.C. However, it’s not just the mountains and rugged coasts that have captured visitors’ attention. B.C. leaves a lasting impression because of its kind people which is why WorldAtlas released its [eight most welcoming BC towns](https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/8-most-welcoming-towns-in-british-columbia.html?fbclid=IwAR21yKzvbm4kCkMX9qtGjfvWgvhTFLcT6goZo6xtpUjweOaKPK-VFIJJ1wc). Two of B.C.’s interior towns topped the list with Revelstoke coming in with the number three position and Penticton at number five. Revelstoke boasts the longest vertical descent at any ski resort in North America and is home to an inland temperate rainforest which is why WorldAtlas dubbed it a “goldmine for outdoor enthusiasts.” This love for the outdoors has fostered a family-like community for outdoorsy folks. That family-like vibe carries over to the art scene as well. Every September, the mountain town hosts Luna Fest, a festival which illuminates the town with music and art installations. Coming in as the fifth most welcoming B.C. town is Penticton. Located south of Kelowna’s wineries, Penticton is home to the Okanagan and Skaha lakes. Nicknamed ‘Peach City,’ it’s hard not to feel peachy when visiting Penticton and its renowned farmer’s market. The market is home to over 45 vendors, while the town is a gateway to picturesque hiking trails such as the Kettle Rail Trail.

    "text": "St Johnstone FC Dare Olufunwa: St Johnstone fans are passionate about Dundee game and we will be bang up for it Saints want to start 2024 with a statement victory at Dens.\nBy Eric Nicolson December 28 2023, 10.24pm Share Dare Olufunwa: St Johnstone fans are passionate about Dundee game and we will be bang up for it Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/st-johnstone/4851956/st-johnstone-dundee-dare-olufunwa-fans/ Copy Link 3 comment Dare Olufunwa. Image: SNS.\n‚ÄòSafe‚Äô football cost St Johnstone the chance to take all three points from Livingston in midweek, according to Craig Levein.\nBut Dare Olufunwa has pledged the Perth side will go full throttle to try and deliver a perfect New Year gift for Saints fans at Dens Park.\nThe former Southampton and Liverpool defender knows the importance of the clash with local rivals, Dundee to the McDiarmid Park club‚Äôs supporters.\nAnd the players could choose no better venue at which to end their winless Premiership run.\n‚ÄúWe want to go into the break on a high,‚Äù said Olufunwa.\n‚ÄúDundee away is one of the biggest games of the season for us ‚Äì it definitely is for the fans.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve spoken to a few of them who have told me!\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very passionate about this game. All the boys will be bang up for it.\n‚ÄúWhen we played them at home the crowd stuck with us even when we were 2-0 down.\n‚ÄúThen Max (Kucheriavyi) came up with two late goals.\n96th minute of the match ‚ö†Ô∏è\nHis 2nd goal of the game ‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è\nMax Kucheriavyi üá∫üá¶ #SJFC pic.twitter.com/I0nytuOPKy\n‚Äî St. Johnstone FC (@StJohnstone) September 4, 2023\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure our fans will make it a great atmosphere and we‚Äôll be doing everything to make sure we give them three points.‚Äù\nReflecting on the draw with Livingston, Olufunwa added: ‚ÄúThe gaffer told us after the game that the positive to take is we got a clean-sheet.\n‚ÄúWe kept the gap above Livingston at seven and it‚Äôs a point that pushes us a little further up the table.\n‚ÄúSince the manager came in we‚Äôve started playing a lot more football.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened against Livingston ‚Äì maybe we went into our shell a little bit.\n‚ÄúThe ball was in the air a lot and when it‚Äôs a game like that it‚Äôs hard to get it down and play. It becomes about headers and clearances.‚Äù\nProving his worth to a new manager Olufunwa had a long wait for his first start under Levein but, having played two of the last three matches, patience and training ground perseverance have paid off.\n‚ÄúWhen the manager first arrived I sat down with him,‚Äù the 22-year-old recalled.\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôd never seen me play before.\n‚ÄúThere was a friendly game with St Mirren during the first international break, which I missed because I was ill.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for a manager to put in a player he‚Äôs never seen.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked really hard in training and I got my chance against Rangers. I thought I was alright.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another chance I‚Äôve had against Livingston and it‚Äôs about me taking every one that I get.\n‚ÄúHopefully, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing.\n‚ÄúEssentially, it‚Äôs about me earning his trust.\n‚ÄúI need to prove to him that he should be picking me.\n‚ÄúI need to show every day in training that I‚Äôm a good player and, especially when it comes to games, I‚Äôve got to put everything out there.‚Äù",

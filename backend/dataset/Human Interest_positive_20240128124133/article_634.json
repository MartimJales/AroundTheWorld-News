    "text": "Garrett Garcia went from not finishing a single play as a junior to being Pennsylvania's best Class 2A player as a senior. Garcia returned from a torn ACL that cost him the 2022 season to lead Southern Columbia on offense and defense, and to the program's seventh consecutive state title. On Thursday, he was named the Class 2A State Player of the Year by the Pennsylvania Football Writers. He becomes the seventh consecutive Tiger to be named the state Player of the Year. Julian Fleming and Gaige Garcia split in 2017, Fleming won in 2018 and 2019, Gavin Garcia won in 2020 and 2021 and Braeden Wisloski earned the honor a year ago. Southern Columbia put five players on the 2A team — Garcia, athlete Louden Murphy, offensive lineman Jude Bremigen, defensive lineman Isaac Carter and linebacker Dom Fetterolf. Mount Carmel also had four and Line Mountain two. Eagles' defenders Max Johnson and Chandon Mauer made the team, as did Mount Carmel running back Luke Blessing, tight end Jacob Schultz, offensive lineman Noah Shimko and wide receiver Xavier Diaz. Garcia missed all but one play as a junior and picked up a new position as a senior in fullback. He led the Class 2A champions with 1,762 yards and 28 touchdowns — both team highs. He finished with 128 tackles, including 14 for a loss. He played the final four playoff games with a sprained knee and ankle — his numbers in that stretch: 65 carries for 482 yards, 6 TDs along with 43 tackles. Murphy had one of the best all-around seasons in the area. Murphy ran for 1,570 yards with 25 touchdowns, while also leading the Tigers with seven touchdown catches. He also returned two punts and a kickoff for a score this season. Diaz caught 52 passes for 903 yards and nine touchdowns for the Red Tornadoes. The 903 yards set a school single-season record, breaking a mark set in 1966. Diaz added 592 yards on the ground with 10 TDs. Carter had 71 tackles, 13 sacks, 23 hurries along 18 total tackles for a lass. He also returned an interception for a touchdown in the state championship game. Fetterolf led the Tigers in tackles with 136 and added two sacks. Johnson, a sophomore, had 84 tackles, including 34 for a loss and 13.5 sacks for the Eagles. Maurer was a four-year starter for Line Mountain and led the team with 136 tackles and 11.5 tackles for a loss.

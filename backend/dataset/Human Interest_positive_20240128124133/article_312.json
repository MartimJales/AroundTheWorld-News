    "text": "Bloomfield native and Indianapolis Colts legend\nDwight Freeney has been named a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the second straight year.\nThe 43-year-old is one of\n15 finalists for the Class of 2024, which will be announced on Thursday, Feb. 8, ahead of the Super Bowl. The induction ceremony will take place next August in Canton, Ohio.\nFreeney played 16 seasons in the NFL from 2002-17, his first eleven with the Colts. He was a seven-time Pro Bowler, making his name as one of the league’s best pass rushers and anchor of a defense that helped the Colts win Super Bowl XLI. He retired with 125 1/2 sacks and 47 forced fumbles, and was inducted into the Colts’\nRing of Honor earlier this year.\nFreeney’s football career began at Bloomfield High School, where head coach Jack Cochran convinced him to switch from soccer to football. He went on to help lead the Warhawks\nto the state title in 1997, one of three straight Bloomfield would win.\nHe then took his talents to Syracuse, where he became an All-American and eventually a first-round draft pick, 11th overall.\nHere are the 15 Hall of Fame finalists:\nEric Allen, DB — 1988-1994 Philadelphia Eagles, 1995-1997 New Orleans Saints, 1998-2001 Oakland Raiders\nJared Allen, DE – 2004-2007 Kansas City Chiefs, 2008-2013 Minnesota Vikings, 2014-2015 Chicago Bears, 2015 Carolina Panthers\nWillie Anderson, OT — 1996-2007 Cincinnati Bengals, 2008 Baltimore Ravens\nJahri Evans, OL — 2006-2016 New Orleans Saints, 2017 Green Bay Packers\nDwight Freeney, DE — 2002-2012 Indianapolis Colts, 2013-14 San Diego Chargers, 2015 Arizona Cardinals, 2016 Atlanta Falcons, 2017 Detroit Lions, 2017 Seattle Seahawks\nAntonio Gates, TE — 2003-2018 San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers\nRodney Harrison, DB — 1994-2002 San Diego Chargers, 2003-2008 New England Patriots\nDevin Hester, PR/KR/WR — 2006-2013 Chicago Bears, 2014-2015 Atlanta Falcons, 2016 Baltimore Ravens, 2016 Seattle Seahawks\nTorry Holt, WR — 1999-2008 St. Louis Rams, 2009 Jacksonville Jaguars\nAndre Johnson, WR — 2003-2014 Houston Texans, 2015 Indianapolis Colts, 2016 Tennessee Titans\nJulius Peppers, DE — 2002-2009/2017-2018 Carolina Panthers, 2010-2013 Chicago Bears, 2014-2016 Green Bay Packers\nFred Taylor, RB — 1998-2008 Jacksonville Jaguars, 2009-2010 New England Patriots\nReggie Wayne, WR — 2001-2014 Indianapolis Colts\nPatrick Willis, LB — 2007-2014 San Francisco 49ers\nDarren Woodson, S — 1992-2003 Dallas Cowboys",

    "text": "Everything local forest man John “Griff” Griffith touches turns to social media gold. We first learned this lesson more than 10 years ago, when, as boss of a California Conservation Corps crew, he went international with a funky dance move video that [left his coworkers in stitches](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2013/mar/12/humboldt-co-cccs-go-viral/). Now, after a couple of career stops and many more videos with mass appeal, Griff seems to have scored his first smash hit with his new outfit, [Redwoods Rising](https://www.savetheredwoods.org/project/redwoods-rising/) — a joint project of the Save the Redwoods League, Redwood State and National Parks and the Yurok Tribe. In the video below — 9.7 million plays, 1.8 million likes and more than 11,000 comments to date — Griff makes the world’s flesh creep at the thought of giant redwood trees falling down upon one’s head. Don’t plant them in your yard! Check it out!

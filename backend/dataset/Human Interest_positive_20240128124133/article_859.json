    "text": "Taftville man among new state troopers honored for saving the life of trooper trainee Seven new state troopers received life saving medals at their graduation ceremony on Thursday for aiding a fellow recruit who collapsed at the state police training academy last summer. The awards were handed out to the recruits, including Trooper Trainee Gunner Nunn of Taftville, after they were sworn in as troopers. Two academy instructors also were honored. State police said that on the early morning of Aug. 18, 2023, a female recruit suffered a medical emergency. Academy staff and students rendered care and coordinated transport to Midstate Medical Center in Meriden and later escorted her ambulance to Yale-New Haven Hospital during a rainstorm. Once at the hospital, the recruit was treated for a life-threatening medical emergency. Both the Yale medical team and the recruit’s family directly attributed the patient’s survival to the immediate response of academy staff and recruits, state police said. They added the support demonstrated by the staff and recruits during and after the incident displayed professionalism and care that went above and beyond expectations. The seven recruits and two instructors who received the Medal for Lifesaving at Thursday’s graduation were trooper trainees Nunn, Julia Gettings, Justin Trzaski, Kelly Mazza, Lina Vivo, Nicholas Jamaitus, Donnell Niles, Trooper First Class Donald Dunning and Sgt. Jason St. John, both academy instructors. Comments are limited to 200 words in length.

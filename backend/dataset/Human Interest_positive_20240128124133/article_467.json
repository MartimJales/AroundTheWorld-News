Nelson was a late addition to the Canadian roster after initially being cut at the [pre-tournament selection camp](https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/two-north-bay-battalion-players-aim-to-crack-canada-s-world-juniors-lineup-1.6676621). During an interview with TSN’s [Mark Masters](https://www.tsn.ca/talent/mark-masters-1.57261) Thursday, Nelson smiled when he heard about all of the support he has been getting from Battalion fans, and the city as a whole, back home. A handful of [Battalion fans gathered at Memorial Gardens](https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/north-bay-hockey-fans-cheering-for-ty-nelson-at-world-juniors-1.6702369) to cheer both the team and their blue liner before the game started against Latvia. “If it wasn’t for North Bay, I wouldn’t be where I am today,” he said. “I’m super grateful for them and I just love the community and the city.” A handful of fans gathered outside of Memorial Gardens in North Bay on Wednesday before Team Canada's game against Latvia to cheer on Battalion defenceman Ty Nelson.

Check out the North Bay page](http://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/north-bay) - [Daily newsletter with the top local stories emailed to your inbox](http://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters) It was a whirlwind few days for Nelson when he received the call he would be joining the team after injuries and illness rocked the team’s defence core. He was in Pittsburgh, Penn. to watch the Penguins play and was on his way to catch the Steelers game as part of a family vacation when [Hockey Canada](https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/home) called him. “I got the news about 10, 15 minutes before I was about to walk out the door for the Steelers game,\" the North Bay Battalion defenceman said. \"Packed up the car and was on the road to Toronto within 20, 30 minutes.\" Nelson boarded a flight in Toronto at 4 p.m. on Sunday. He landed in Gothenburg a little after 3 p.m. on Monday. He would have arrived sooner, but his connecting flight was delayed. \"We were flying into Gothenburg and the winds were too heavy,\" he said. \"We landed, but then had to go right back into the air. It was a pretty scary day, not going to lie. Then we were in Stockholm for about an hour and a half. Luckily, we were able to land in Gothenburg when we flew back. It was about a 45-minute flight so not too bad.\" Nelson played a little over seven minutes against Finland but didn’t record a point. “There’s nothing more grateful than playing at Mem. (Memorial) Gardens with the fans behind me and it’s now amazing to have them behind me here,” Nelson said. Team Canada has the day off on Thursday at the tournament. The next game will be a tough test for the Canadians facing off against host country Sweden on Friday at 1:30 p.m. EST. The game is on [TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/).

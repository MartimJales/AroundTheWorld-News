    "text": "President Joe Biden signed Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse's bipartisan bill that's aimed to expand access to counseling and mental health services for Colorado's military families.\nBiden signed the bill into law last week as it was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\"Today, through the enactment of the Mental Health for Military Families Act, we are doing our part to care for our nation's service members and their spouses and children,\" said Neguse. \"These individuals sacrifice so much to defend our country, and by expanding access to critical mental health services we are making sure they have the support they need.\"\nThe act is set to allow the Secretary of Defense to waive out-of-pocket expenses on TRICARE -- the military's health insurance provider -- for their first three outpatient mental health visits per year, which will lower costs and help with treatment for military families, according to the press release.\nThe proposal was reportedly championed by U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia.\n\"Our bipartisan bill, which is now law, will expand free access to counseling and mental health services for servicemembers and their families who make great sacrifices for our nation, endure great stress in so doing, and deserve nothing less than the care they need â€” when they need it,\" said Ossoff.\nMore from CBS News Denver reassures migrant families will not be discharged from shelters Nuggets sign 100 Special Olympics Colorado athletes to 1-day contracts 2 children missing out of Sterling found Authorities release identity of victim killed at Citadel Mall I-70 back open on Colorado's Eastern Plains amid blizzard warning Kasey Richardson Kasey Richardson is Covering Colorado First in the CBS Colorado newsroom as a digital media producer.

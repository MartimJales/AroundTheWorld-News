    "text": "The villagers of Ramanathapuram city, Tamil Nadu named a road after the Union Finance Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman. This recognition comes after the Minister advocated for the construction of a flyover in Landhai village located near Ramanathapuram. The villagers had been protesting for over 14 years demanding the closure of a railway tunnel and construction of a flyover in Landhai village to significantly benefit the affected communities. In response, Sitharaman took a proactive approach by requesting funds for the flyover project. Through a video conference, Sitharaman stated that the flyover construction is expected to be completed within four months. A bridge will also be built soon to protect the agriculture and livelihoods of 2,000 people. She urged full public cooperation to ensure timely completion. Earlier, during a flood relief visit, the Bharatiya Janata Party President of Ramanathapuram District had informed the State President and Sitharaman directly about the villagersâ€™ demand. Subsequently, Sitharaman visited Landhai village and received a petition regarding the demand from the public. On the first day of receiving the petition, Rs. 17 crore and 32 lakhs were allocated for Lantai village. The people of Lanthai village and five nearby villages started celebrating upon learning about fund allocation for the flyover project. A special resolution was passed during a village meeting thanking the District BJP President. The road board was unveiled naming the road after Sitharaman in recognition of her facilitating the fund allocation for the flyover construction. Several leaders from the local BJP unit, including the District President, Agriculture Team State Secretary and District General Secretary were present on the occasion.",

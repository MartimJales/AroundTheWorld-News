    "text": "Gemma Collins has treated her mum to a one of a kind hairdressing experience with friends Jedward as the pair perform a blonde at home makeover.\nThe Irish music twins have long been friends with the former\nThe Only Way Is Essex star since their time in Celebrity Big Brother, and it appears they've now brought Gemma's mum into the friendship too.\nIn a video on\nGemma didn't share the finished result with fans, leaving everyone guessing whether the twins hairdressing skills did the job for Joan. However Gemma has been sharing funny clips and videos to Instagram as Jedward stayed with her, fiancé Rami Hawash and Gemma's family. In one clip on her social media, Gemma can be heard laughing as Jedward sing\nChristmas songs and play a guitar in her garden surrounded by festive decorations.\nThe musical performers have previously opened up on their friendship with Gemma, as they praised her as \"a solid person\" in their lives. The pair revealed a bond with Gemma Collins in an exclusive chat to the Mirror as they revealed the star has a different side to what the public sees and that she kindly helped them when they moved to London recently.\nSpeaking to the Mirror, Jedward said: \"Our friend Gemma [Collins] recently gave us her furniture, so we have some Barbie furniture in our spot. Gemma is such a vibe, such a solid person in our lives. We've known each other for a few years now. There's a lot more to Gemma, cos obviously everyone has this opinion of Gemma but she can get deep and she's had things happen in her life.\"\nThe festive get together comes just a few months after Jedward revealed they'd been the victim of a mugging. Former\nX Factor star Edward Grimes has revealed that he was left 'shaken up' after an attempted mugging by masked attackers. Writing on\nHe added: \"Felt my wrist and arm being grabbed from behind it all happened so fast and didn’t have John next to me. Just would hate this to happen to anyone else and being made feel vulnerable.\"\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click\nthis link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

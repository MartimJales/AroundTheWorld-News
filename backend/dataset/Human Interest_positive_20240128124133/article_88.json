    "text": "Stephanie Quintero wondered how she and her family would pay for food as a student at Dallas College after her father lost his job during the COVID-19 pandemic. A food pantry at the school became their primary source of nutrition for weeks. After Dallas Morning News reporter Marcela Rodrigues wrote this year about the heartbreaking reality that many college students struggle with food insecurity , at least one reader told us she dropped off groceries at the school’s Mountain View campus. The inhumane conditions of children inside Dallas’ Henry Wade Juvenile Justice Center came to light this year also as part of our work. In one of several stories about the facility, parents of nine children inside the center told reporter Josephine Peterson that their kids were locked up for hours each day and not allowed outside for weeks, even months, at a time. The children were also denied medical care and adequate amounts of food. Our reporting led the state to open an investigation into the center.\nAdvertisement Unanswered complaints from residents who lived in homes near a plant in southwest Dallas also caught our attention. After reporter Maria Ramos Pacheco’s began asking questions, the city shut down the smelly biofuel facility that rendered animal fat for operating without proper zoning .\nAdvertisement These stories, and many others, are representative of our purpose and mission at The Dallas Morning News . We want our journalism to lead to a better North Texas. We want our journalism to make an impact across generations. We want you to see our journalism as indispensable.\nBreaking News Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nSIGN UP Or with:",

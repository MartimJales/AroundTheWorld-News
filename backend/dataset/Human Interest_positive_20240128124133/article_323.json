    "text": "Wouldn’t it be great if we could just keep our Christmas trees up year-round? The twinkling lights and aroma of the pine tree make the house feel so cozy and festive, we’re reluctant to take this part of Christmas down. But now that December 25th has come and gone, the time to dismantle that beautifully decorated tree is fast approaching. So when is the right time to take down the tree? A few may be ready to haul theirs to the curb ASAP, while others are happy to put it off for as long as possible.\nIt turns out, some people choose the date for superstitious reasons, others for religious reasons and some just do it when it’s most convenient for them. These are the three most popular dates to take down the Christmas tree and when to do it to avoid bad luck.\nDecember 31st - Some folks want their evergreen down before the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve. Otherwise, it’s said you’ll be dragging all your baggage and bad luck from last year into the new year. So if you’re superstitious about these things, you’ve only got a couple days left with your Christmas tree. January 5th - This is traditionally considered the twelfth day of Christmas, so it’s the end of the holiday merriment and some folks like to take down the tree then to get closure on the season. January 6th - Some plan to take theirs down then in observance of the Epiphany, a Christian holiday. And some also say leaving your Christmas tree up after January 6th brings bad luck.

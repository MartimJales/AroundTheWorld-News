    "text": "2023-12-28 20:05:15\nDubai: After taking charge as the brand ambassador, tennis world number five Andrey Rublev attended a meet and greet event held at Jumeirah Med Care Medical Center. Andrey Rublev noted that as a professional athlete, he always prioritizes health, fitness and healthy living, and he appreciates Aster Pharmacy’s focus on providing good health and happiness by partnering with MedCare’s ‘Happiness Begins with Health’ campaign.\nReminiscing that sports are the best way to ward off lifestyle diseases, Rublev observed that superstars such as Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are examples for us all because they show excellence beyond their age by maintaining good health.\nAlong with his career, Andrei Rublev also finds time to help those around him. He could see many people suffering around him. Many children are affected by the difficulty as a teenager. That’s when I thought, when I become a good player, I can help these people, – he told reporters.\n”Now seems like the time to do something. All I can do now. I continue that,” he said.\nHe hoped the relationship with Medcare and Aster Pharmacy would improve. Rublev made no fuss about missing Wimbledon after the All England Tennis Club banned Russian and Belarusian players over the Ukraine war just months after his Dubai victory. Instead, Rublev worked hard to play mixed doubles with Ukrainian players. It was solidarity with fellow professionals in Ukraine. He also shocked the world by sending the message ‘There is no war in tennis’. Our next generation must be better than us. Be kinder than ourselves. There are still many bad things going on in the world. He said that it is important to help every person and try to be a better person.\nHe remembers watching the iconic tennis match between Federer and Andre Agassi with bated breath in 2005 at the Burj Al Arab helipad, nearly 700 feet above ground level. He also observed that Dubai is one of the best places in the world where every tennis player prepares for the new season.\nRublev is also a tennis player who received a golden visa of the UAE. Winner of 14 ATP titles. Olympic mixed doubles gold medalist.\nMeet and Greet Medcare CEO Dr. Shanila Laiju, Aster Retails CEO NS Balasubramanian and Chief Marketing Officer Rahul Kadavakolu were also present.\nComments in the comment box are not good morning.

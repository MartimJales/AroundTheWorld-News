    "text": "To commemorate Carrie Fisher ‘s seventh death anniversary, American Horror Story alum Billie Lourd shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram as she honestly expressed her grief over missing her late mother’s presence. The Star Wars legend died last December 27, 2016 at the age of 60. “It has been 7 years since my mom died (but who’s counting?? Me I guess?) Every anniversary brings a different iteration of my grief,” Lourd wrote. “Some infuse me with rage, some make me cry all day long, some make me feel dissociated and empty, some make me feel nothing, some make me feel guilty for feeling nothing, and some make me feel all of those things all at once.” You can check out her full tribute below: Fisher first gained global recognition through her iconic performance as Princess Leia Organa in George Lucas’ 1977 film Star Wars. Due to its massive success, the sci-fi movie grew into a major multimedia franchise which spawned multiple movies, TV shows and video games. Since then, Fisher had become a pop culture icon along with co-stars Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. After starring in original Star Wars trilogy, Fisher had the chance to reprise Princess Leia in Lucasfilm’s latest sequel trilogy where she was reintroduced as General Leia of the Resistance. Lourd also appeared alongside her mother in the sequel trilogy as Lieutenant Kaydel Ko Connix.

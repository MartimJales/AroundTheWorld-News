    "text": "How does your money help? Showing the impact of the Penny Campaign Many service organizations in the community hold their biggest fundraisers of the year over the holidays, including the Samaritan Ministries' Penny Campaign. As the season of giving winds down, we got a first-hand look at how your giving impacts those being served at their shelter and soup kitchen. Nathan Walker eats at Samaritan Ministries' soup kitchen every day. He says he fell into a deep depression after his girlfriend of fourteen years died of breast cancer. Walker said, \"And I ended up losing my job. I battled depression, and right now, I'm looking for services like this so I can get back stable and get my life back together.\" And getting his life back together takes more than just a meal. Walker says, \"Well, they're providing clothes and access to the internet to look for a job and, of course, the shelter where at least I can have a place to rest my head at night.\" Jan Kelly is the executive director of Samaritan Ministries. She says the money raised from the Penny campaign helps them fulfill their mission of providing food, shelter and hope through Christian love. Kelly said, \"It is a privilege for us to be able to walk alongside of people and to give them that nourishment through our meals and to give those friendly smiles so that they can think about their future.\" Kelly says that funds are important, but they also need volunteers to serve food and encouragement. She said, \"Volunteers are not just about performing the tasks. It's important that they help prepare the food. It's important that they help clean up after the meals. But the most important thing that they do is to give people hope.\" Walker said those messages of hope and encouragement mean so much to the people being served here. \"to take time out to give those who are going through a life crisis, losing their family or whatever the case may be is definitely a great way to show that someone cares.\" Samaritan Ministries raised $82,000 during this year's Penny Campaign, and they're hoping to reach their goal of $90,000 by the end of the year.

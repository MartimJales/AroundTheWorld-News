    "text": "News All the Animals at This Shelter Were Adopted for the First Time in 47 Years All 598 animals in the shelter's care have been adopted and 125 strays were reunited with their owners By Scout Richards Published on 12/28/2023 at 2:41 PM\nFacebook / Adams County SPCA Facebook / Adams County SPCA For the first time in 47 years, the Adams County SPCA in Pennsylvania had all of its animals adopted.\n'To say that we are beyond excited is an understatement! The staff and volunteers have worked VERY hard to take care of the animals in our care and to make sure they got adopted to the right home,' the shelter posted on Facebook on December 22.\nThe shelter said that it was almost at capacity in early December. But now, all 598 animals in its care have been adopted and 125 strays were reunited with their owners.\n'It has been a busy year! We thank everyone for their continued support and look forward to new adventures in 2024,' the shelter said. 'We will be pulling animals from other shelters in PA next week in hopes of relieving some of their stress. Right now, we are going to enjoy this accomplishment! Merry Christmas!'\nAccording to the ASPCA, around 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized annually. That number has dropped from approx 2.6 million animals in 2011. The organization explained that decrease is partly due to a rise in adoptions and strays being successfully reunited with their owners.",

On the boys side, the Gulfport admirals took home the 6A powerlifting title. In April D’iberville took aim to take home the Class III archery state championship.

In June, four coast baseball teams hit the road to Pearl as two became back to back state title winners.

With that the athletic year came to a close, we moved through June and July students came back to school, Mississippi added in 7A, and once October rolled around, we were ready for another round of championships. [OLA took home the 3A volleyball state title](https://www.wlox.com/2023/10/25/our-lady-academy-brings-home-16th-volleyball-state-title/) over Alcorn central making it back-to-back state titles for the Lady Crescents and the schools 16th overall volleyball title. From the court and into the pool, the Pearl River Central blue devils took home the Class II championship in swimming. Golf was moved to a fall sport this year so a second round of golf champions were crowned as the Hancock girls, East Central girls, and OLA girls all took home state titles. In cross country, the St. Patrick boys took home the 3A title, continuing a years long run of success for both the boys and girls cross country teams. As football season made its way through the fall we saw plenty of action and memorable moments but for the first time in more than a decade a coast team was not represented in the state title games. For the cheer teams though, three squads came home with hardware, Poplarville, West Harrison, and Vancleave coming home with cheer championships. With that, it brings a close to the calendar year for 2023 with 26 state titles for coast teams. As 2024 is right around the corner many more teams will have more great opportunities to succeed and shine at the highest levels.

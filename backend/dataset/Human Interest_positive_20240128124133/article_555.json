    "text": "Every player on the [New York Giants](https://www.bigblueview.com/)’ 53-man roster participated in Thursday’s practice, good news for the Giants as they prepare for a Week 17 game against the Loa Angeles Rams. There has been concern about punter Jamie Gillan. He entered last week’s game with a sore left groin, and then injured his left (kicking) knee chasing Eagles’ punt returner Britain Covey on a 54-yard return. Gillan has punted 85 times this season, a career high. Only Thomas Morstead (87) of the [New York Jets](https://www.ganggreennation.com/) has punted more. Special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey said Gillan has “got a lot of reps in that leg” and is “getting a little tender” toward the end of the season. Giants-Rams injury report Giants Limited participation CB Deonte Banks (shoulder) TE Lawrence Cager (groin) P Jamie Gillan (left groin/left knee) DL Dexter Lawrence (hamstring) OL Justin Pugh (elbow/back) DL A’Shawn Robinson (back) DL Rakeem Nunez-Roches (knee) Full participation RB Saquon Barkley (elbow) G Ben Bredeson (quad) CB Adoree’ Jackson (ankle) WR Wan’Dale Robinson (quad) C John Michael Schmitz (shoulder) TE Darren Waller (knee)",

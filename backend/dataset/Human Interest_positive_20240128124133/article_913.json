    "text": "Photo by Iiris L on Unsplash\nPortland International Airport Welcomes Therapy Llamas\nDecember 28, 2023\nDealing with holiday travel chaos just got more bearable thanks to a unique initiative taken at the Portland International Airport in Oregon. The\nairport has welcomed a comforting pair of therapy llamas to help ease the stress of holiday travelers — introducing a refreshing blend of amusement and tranquility amidst the holiday frenzy.\nThese therapeutic llamas, named Beni and Prince, have been invited to the airport on three separate occasions this month. The duo hails from Mountain Peaks Therapy Llamas & Alpacas, a farm known for its therapeutic animals, and their visits have stirred quite a buzz on\nsocial media. Their delightfully unexpected presence at the airport has been celebrated for its novelty and the positive vibes it has generated, further enhancing Portland’s reputation for embracing unconventionality.\nTherapy animals are often used to alleviate stress and anxiety, and their application at airports has grown in popularity in recent years. Weighing in at 400 pounds each, these gentle giants have been meandering through the airport terminals, providing a soothing distraction for passengers amidst the holiday rush.\nAllison Ferre, the media relations manager with the Port of Portland, the organization that runs the airport, mentioned that partnering with various therapy animal programs throughout the year has proven to be a great stress-buster for passengers. Expressing her appreciation, she said, “The llamas deliver instant joy.”\nThe airport’s social media channel has also shared about the llamas’ cheerful presence. Adding to their charm, Beni and Prince were adorned with a festive reindeer theme featuring antler headbands, glittery halters with tinkling bells, and wreaths decorated with poinsettias.\nWe took an unconventional approach to helping travelers manage holiday travel stress and it got a lot of love. It was wonderful to see the smiles these Therapy Llamas brought to PDX visitors and beyond!

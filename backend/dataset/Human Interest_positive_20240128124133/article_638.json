    "text": "Chuck E. Cheese marks Autism Awareness Month with the return of its program for children with autism and other sensory sensitivity needs. The family entertainment and dining venue announced it will bring back its “Sensory Sensitive Sundays” program to participating locations nationwide on Sunday, April 11. The program creates dedicated playtime tailored for children with autism and other special sensory needs, offering a quieter dining and entertainment environment, dimmed lighting and a sensory-friendly arcade experience. Chuck E. Cheese locations that have reopened for games will open two hours early to host Sensory Sensitive Sunday events. The following locations in South Florida will participate in Sensory Sensitive Sunday on these dates: - BOCA RATON 21699 State Road 7, Boca Raton, FL 33428 - BOYNTON BEACH 244 N Congress Ave Bay 2A, Boynton Beach, FL 33425 - FORT LAUDERDALE – SUNRISE 8099 W Oakland Park Blvd, Sunrise, FL 33311 - HIALEAH 3805 West 20th Avenue, Hialeah, FL 33012 - KENDALL 8701 S W 124th Avenue, Miami, FL 33183 - MIAMI – NORTH – 20335 Biscayne Blvd. L-1, Miami, FL 33180 - MIAMI – SOUTH DADE 18575 South Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33157 - PEMBROKE PINES 8515 Pines Blvd, Pembroke Pines, FL 33024 - POMPANO BEACH 2201 N Federal Hwy #201, Pompano Beach, FL 33062 - STUART 2400 N.W. Federal Highway, Stuart, FL 34994 - WEST PALM BEACH 2471 Okeechobee Boulevard, West Palm Beach, FL 33409 See other participating locations [here](https://www.chuckecheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SSS-STORELIST-r2.pdf). Select locations nationwide will reintroduce the program the first Sunday of every month for the remainder of 2021, according to a release. “For many years, we’ve hosted Sensory Sensitive Sundays to ensure that Chuck E. Cheese is truly the place where every kid can be a kid,” CEC Entertainment chief marketing officer Sherri Landry said in a release. “We’ve heard from families that they appreciated the program and how much they’ve missed it while it’s been paused during the pandemic. Bringing back Sensory Sensitive Sundays during Autism Awareness Month is a fitting way to celebrate and support these children and their families.” Chuck E. Cheese is also launching a month-long round-up campaign benefiting Autism Speaks, allowing guests to round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and support Autism Speaks’ research and advocacy efforts. The CDC estimates that approximately 1 in 54 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. “Finding ways to create spaces where autistic children feel safe, seen and heard is what makes Chuck E. Cheese the ultimate place where Every Kid Can be A Kid,” the company said. Chuck E. Cheese launched Sensory Sensitive Sundays for the first time in 2018. For more information on Chuck E.

    "text": "Married At First Sight star Shona Manderson has bravely revealed her secret battle with acne.\nThe 31 year old reality\nTV star took to Instagram to share a make-up free selfie and an \"acne update\" with her 143K followers. In the candid post, she said: \"Acne update. My skin was great after my peel I was buzzing with it but it's flared up again.\n\"I decided to finally go to the GP and I've been given 3 months of Lymecycline (antibiotics) and acnecide gel. For those interested I'll keep you updated with how I get on and if anyone's taken before please let me know how you got on I was really reluctant to take antibiotics but they're like cysts and so red!\"\nIn the skin update, she continued to say: \"Thank you so much for your kind messages about my skin. I'm taking so many tips and I really appreciate you reaching out.\"\nWhile acne is a common skin condition, Shona attributed her skin battle to her contraception - an IUD. This produces a progesterone hormone, which is an androgen.\nTalking about this she said: \"Here's a little update where I'm at, so my spots seem to be like here, here, here, got them really bad on my chin. But I'm getting my coil removed on Monday so hopefully... fingers crossed.\"\nShona became a fan favourite on MAFS, after going through a controlling relationship with Brad Kelly during her time on the show. Viewers were thrilled when she returned for the last dinner party of the series, appearing to be back to her old confident self, leaving Brad behind.\nAfter her split from Brad, Shona fell for another man from the show, Matt Pilmoor, who had originally been married to Adrienne Naylor. The couple\nexclusively revealed their new relationship to OK! and said they want to get married and have children.\nMatt said: \"We definitely want to get married. Getting married abroad would be lovely but logically we would do it in the UK for family coming. We do need money so there will be no ring anytime soon! But I would love to propose at some point. Let's see how the next year goes in terms of finances but it's definitely on the cards!\"\nWhile Shona shared: \"Yeah we've spoken about getting married. Matt has said he will wear a kilt because my family are Scottish. We've spoken about engagement rings, we just need the money first.\"\nAnd when it comes to creating a family, it appears they are both on the same page. \"I want two kids. I'm 32 next year so I definitely want babies in the next few years. It's mental but when you know, you know, and it just works. And it can move at a healthy pace. I don't even feel scared about anything\", Shona revealed.\nAfter confirming their relationship last month, the 32 year old opened up further and said: \"We have a really healthy, happy, safe, fun, relationship - I really appreciate Matt, it's what I deserve, we deserve each other.\"\nThe couple admitted to having to keep their relationship under wraps until MAFS had finished being aired.\nExplaining this Shona said: \"Matt would be driving and I would be in the back, we would be walking around Nottingham and I'd be all the way over there, we were like secret agents on a mission.\" Adding: \"I'm proud to be his girlfriend and it just works.\"\n* This article was crafted with the help of an AI engine, which speeds up OK!'s editorial research and applies it to article templates created by journalists in our newsrooms.

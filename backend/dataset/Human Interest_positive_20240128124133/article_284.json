    "text": "SEATTLE — The Seattle Mariners have signed 32-year-old Mitch Garver to a two-year contract with a mutual option running through the 2026 season.\nThe deal was officially announced by General Manager Justin Hollander on Thursday.\nThe Mariners roster now holds 37 players out of a possible 40.\n“Mitch is a hitter we had targeted from the start of the offseason,” Mariners President of Baseball Operations Jerry Dipoto said. “He’s a proven winner who brings a strong combination of zone discipline, on-base skills, and power to the middle of our lineup, while also adding tough-to-find depth at key positions.”\nIn 2023, Garver hit 19 homers in just 87 games with a .270 batting average and .370 on-base percentage.\nThe 220-pound designated hitter has appeared in a total of 7 Major League seasons with both Minnesota and Texas in 450 career games.\nGarver was named an American League Silver Slugger in 2019 after ranking eighth in the Majors. He is also a World Series champion.\nHe was originally drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2013 out of the University of New Mexico.\n ",

    "text": "Twin Valley’s Cody Magnant takes an attempt on goal during a Vermont Principal Association’s Division 4 Boys Soccer Championship on Saturday, Nov. 4, 2023.\nReformer file photo WILMINGTON — Twin Valley senior boys soccer player Cody Magnant broke the school’s single season scoring record with 37 goals, helping lead the Wildcats to an undefeated regular season and the team’s first appearance in the Division 4 state finals since 2020. Magnant’s achievement makes it the Reformer’s No. 3 moment of 2023.\nMagnant’s record breaking goal, his second of the game, came in the 55th minute of the second half of the quarterfinal game against West Rutland off an assist from Steven Oyer to give the Wildcats a 5-0 lead. The goal was Magnant’s 34th of the season.\nMagnant broke the record set by Scott Hayford, the son of Twin Valley soccer coach and Athletic Director Buddy Hayford, who scored 33 goals in 2009.\n“He broke a longstanding record. Records are made to be broken as we know,” Buddy Hayford said after the game against West Rutland. “It took a while, but Cody’s that kind of player where if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him. So, kudos to him because he earned it. He definitely earned it.”\nTwin Valley defeated West Rutland 6-0 in the game to advance to the Division 4 semifinals.\nThe semifinal game against Rivendell was played in extreme conditions as heavy snowfall began 20 minutes prior to the start of the game after the field had been cleared of snow earlier in the day. The game was nearly called about 10 minutes in when the referees and coaches paused the game to confer about the snow squall. Despite the conditions, Magnant scored a hat-trick and added an assist in the team’s 7-1 win to advance to the Division 4 finals, where Twin Valley fell short against defending champion Winooski.\nDuring the season, Magnant scored hat-tricks against Rivendell, Springfield and Green Mountain. He scored four goals in three instances — against Bellows Falls, Long Trail School and Springfield — and scored five goals in a game against Green Mountain on his way to breaking the record.\nFor his performance throughout the season, Magnant earned C Division first team all-Southern Vermont League (SVL) honors and Division 4 All-State honors.",

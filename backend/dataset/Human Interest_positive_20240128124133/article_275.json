    "text": "Kelly Clarkson knows firsthand that \"you've really got to want your dream\" in order to make it in the music industry. On Wednesday's episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show , the \"Since U Been Gone\" singer shared with guest Kevin Bacon that when she moved to Los Angeles, she moved in with a stranger. \"I actually moved out to LA with some random person I did not know,\" she told Bacon. \"Really?\" he replied . \"Yeah, she just needed a roommate,\" added Clarkson . \"I was like, 'I'll do it,' and I moved from Texas to LA with a random stranger.\" Clarkson didn't live with her roommate for too long though, because their apartment building caught on fire. \"It burned down, so yeah,\" she added. \"Then, I slept in my car for a few days and then tried out for a show called American Idol so it all worked out.\" The singer went on to win the first season of the singing competition show when she was 20 years old. \"You've really got to want your dream,\" Clarkson concluded. \"The universe makes you really want it.\"",

    "text": "Mum of girl (5) left fighting for life on Parnell Square says she is out of ICU and has smiled The girl’s mother says her daughter is now out of Temple Street Children’s Hospital’s Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) The mum of a five-year-old girl left fighting for her life on Parnell Street has revealed her daughter is improving and has “even smiled”. The girl has remained in hospital where she is being treated for critical injuries following the incident on 23 November in Dublin’s city centre. Crèche worker Leanne Flynn, from Dublin, was also seriously injured during the same incident on Parnell Square. However, the girl’s mum has now given an update on her health through a GoFundMe page set up to help the family, called ' [Barróg do Chailín Beag'](http://gofund.me/6b6f1e1e) (A Hug for a Little Girl). The little girl’s parents have previously used the online fundraising site – which has raised more than €58,000 so far - to keep well-wishers informed of her progress. On a message left on the GoFundMe page, the girl’s mother says her daughter is now out of Temple Street Children’s Hospital’s Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). She writes: “Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled. \"We still have a long time still in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support. \"All our love.” Following the attack on Parnell Street, the girl was rushed to Temple Street where she received emergency medical treatment for critical injuries. However, she has recently rallied and made progress under the care of hospital staff and medics. The GoFundMe page can be found at: [https://gofund.me/6b6f1e1e](https://gofund.me/6b6f1e1e). Riad Bouchaker (50) is currently before the courts in connection with the incident on November 23. He is charged with three counts of attempted murder, one of producing and possessing a kitchen knife, three counts of assault causing harm and one of assault causing serious harm.",

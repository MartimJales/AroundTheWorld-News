    "text": "The concert “Rīga Arena” was held in two parts – the first part was dedicated to the performance together with the Latvian Radio big band and Kristīni Prauliņa. The second part, on the other hand, was a retrospective look at the artist’s brightest singles of all time.\nĘirts Rozentāls or “Ozols” is one of the founders of Latvian hip-hop music. He started his musical activity in 1996 as part of the groups “Fact” and “Rool Makaz”. He started his solo career at the beginning of the last decade with the debut single “Neko 2005”, which was followed by the albums “Cieņa un lībės”, “Higher, further, stronger, “Dūzis” and the album “Neatkarība” released in 2009.\nAfter a break of several years, in 2015 “Ozols” returned to Latvian music with the fifth studio album “Back to the future”. During his creative activity, “Ozols” performed at the Song Festival with the combined choir, with the association “Austrumubloks” he visited ex-president Vaira Vīke-Freiberga, achieved the status of a Golden Disc with the albums “Cieņa un līstė” and “Higher, further, stronger”, received eight times Latvian Music Recordings of the Year Award.\n2023-12-28 20:40:20\n#\nPHOTO #Ozols #thousands #people #happy #concert #Arena",

    "text": "Kate has consulted experts in the sector to learn how best to highlight the issue\nThe Princess of Wales is set to turn her attention to the importance of fathers in children’s early years.\nKate has met a number of fathers’ groups amid plans to raise awareness about the role men play at the beginning of youngsters’ lives.\nShe has consulted experts in the sector to find out how best to highlight the issue, as well as how to attract more fathers to parenting groups and support their mental health.\nResearch by the princess’s Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood found that only 19 per cent of the population could identify the period between pregnancy and the age of five as the most important for shaping a child’s future. While one in four women did, this was matched by only 14 per cent of men.\nThe Princess of Wales takes part in a Dad Walk in the local park during a visit to “Dadvengers”, a community for dads and their children, in Arnos Grove, north London, on November 1 to highlight the important role that fathers play in their children’s earliest years\nKate has met a number of fathers’ groups amid plans to raise awareness about the role men play at the beginning of youngsters’ lives. She is pictured on November 1 during a Dad Walk in Arnos Grove, north London\nKate’s decision to increase her focus on fatherhood follows her visit to Maidenhead Rugby Club in Berkshire in June to speak to men about their experiences as first-time fathers.\nRugby star Ugo Monye is among the high-profile figures backing the princess’s Shaping Us campaign, which raises awareness of the importance of early childhood.\nMonye said he had been ‘highly impressed by Her Royal Highness and her dedication to a topic which connects so many of us’.\nChristian Guy, executive director of the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘There remains a real need to provide information, advice and support to men about what a significant role they can play in the earliest days, weeks and months – and even before the baby is born – which is such an important period developmentally and begins to lay foundations for the rest of their lives.’",

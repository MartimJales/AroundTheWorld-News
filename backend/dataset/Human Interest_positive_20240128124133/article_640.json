    "text": "A new live-action fan film based on the hit [Batman Beyond](https://comingsoon.net/tag/batman-beyond) franchise has released a teaser trailer, previewing a new story written about Terry McGinnis. The new film, titled Batman Beyond: Year One, is from Lumis Entertainment. The trailer for the film features a few mainstay characters from the world of Batman, including Terry McGinnis, The Joker, The Royal Flush Gang, and a few other Easter Eggs. The film is finished with production, but is currently seeking additional funding in the post-production process. The team behind the movie have launched an [Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/batman-beyond-year-one-fan-film-post-production#/) looking to raise funds. Check out the Batman Beyond: Year One Teaser Trailer below (watch other clips and trailers): Who is involved with Batman Beyond: Year One? Batman Beyond: Year One is written and directed by Michael Yu. Additional credits include Ian Hussey as cinematographer, Jay Kwon as action designer, Susanna Song as costume designer, Marc de Bertier as production designer, Vanessa Lee as super suit factory, Luke Gibleon as sound designer, Alexander Arntzen as composer, Neil Craig and Nick Lund-Ulrich as VFX supervisors, while Gc5 FX is the suit costumer. “The year is 2050,” the official synopsis of the film reads. “It’s been years since the Batman’s disappearance. Gotham has rebuilt itself as a city of the future, now known as Neo Gotham. It’s booming with neon lights, technology of tomorrow and brand-new villains running the streets in the absence of the caped crusader. That is, until a young Terry McGinnis discovers an elderly Bruce Wayne’s identity as the Batman and takes it upon himself to take the mantle. Our story follows Terry several months after becoming Batman. While he’s received some training, he’s still a fairly new crime fighter. A crime organization known as the Royal Flush Gang, longtime enemies of Bruce, has recently resurfaced in Gotham with a new family in charge. Join us as we watch Terry’s journey continue to unfold.”",

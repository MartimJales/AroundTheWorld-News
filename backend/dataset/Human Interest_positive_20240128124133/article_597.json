    "text": "The entertainer Cinzia Francischiello closes the year with a happy heart. And the Valencian blonde received a visit from her boyfriend, the soccer player Dylan Gissi. It is not the first time that the defender of the Defense and Justice team visits the country to spend time with his partner, but it is the first Christmas he has spent on tricolor soil. The athlete took advantage of the vacation that the team to which he belongs gave him to spend time with the blonde and, in the process, stroll through the natural beauties of Venezuela. ‚ÄúChristmas in paradise ‚ú®üå¥ because it always has to be with the family‚Ä¶ We even have a visit from Santa to cheer up the little children of Los Roques üéÅ üéÖüèª,‚Äù Cinzia commented as a description of a video where she appears with Gissi while they were enjoying the archipelago. In addition to swimming in the waters of the Caribbean, the couple attended a wedding of a friend of the Televen presenter, where Dylan had the opportunity to eat some typical Venezuelan dishes. One year In addition to spending the December holidays, Cinzia Francischiello and her Swiss-Argentine boyfriend celebrate one year of starting to exchange messages via ‚Äú‚ÄòMerry Christmas‚Äô is how it all started a year ago‚ô•Ô∏è We hope you have the most beautiful holidays full of smiles and joy ü•∞‚ú®,‚Äù the presenter also expressed in a publication. Everything seems to indicate that he took the first step. The 32-year-old broke the ice by answering a story from the Venezuelan on December 24, which she did not hesitate to answer. The rest is history. Now they call each other ‚Äúbaby‚Äù and the footballer takes advantage of any opportunity to enjoy quality time with Francischiello. It cannot be ignored that the blonde's first visit to Venezuelan soil was last August. For three days he was able to visit some tourist spots in Greater Caracas, such as the beaches of La Guaira, the Warairarepano Cable Car Tourist Complex, among others.",

    "text": "Fall is my favorite season for various reasons, one being that there are so many cute fall activities you could do. Here’s a list of fun fall festivities that are on my fall bucket list!\nPaint a Pumpkin\nPainting a pumpkin for Halloween is super cute and fun to do! I’ve already done this so I could check it off my list, but using fall colors to paint a pumpkin is a fun activity to do!\nCarve a Pumpkin\nYou can get really creative while carving a pumpkin and it could be anything cute or spooky!\nBake Halloween Cookies\nBuying ready-to-bake cookies that are Halloween-themed is always a cute fall activity to do and goes great with my next point!\nWatch Spooky Movies\nAfter you make your spooky cookies, you could watch a spooky movie and or a fall show/movie since there are so many out there! My favorite Halloween movie is “The Nightmare Before Christmas”.\nHave Fall Photoshoots\nThere are so many options for cute fall pictures. I use Pinterest to help me think of what pictures I want to take!\nHave a Bonfire/S’mores Night\nWhat a perfect time to have a bonfire. Being huddled up by a fire on a nice fall night and just making s’mores is such a fall vibe.\nRead a Suspenseful Book\nI never read anything but romance novels, so this fall I bought two books: “Too Late” by Colleen Hoover and “Wrong Place Wrong Time” by Gillian McAllister. I’m excited to read both this October!\nFall Picnic/Painting\nI usually paint during the summertime, but how cute would it be to sit outside and have a cute fall picnic and paint something using fall colors only?\nCollect Leaves\nAn easy way to appreciate the fall time is by collecting leaves! Super random, but how cute would it be to go on a leaves scavenger hunt and collect leaves of all colors and put them in a scrapbook or tape them inside a journal?\nNature Walk\nGoing on a nature walk during fall really allows you to take in the weather and the change of the season!\nTry Fall Drinks\nCoffee shops come up with such cute fall drinks so why not go out and try them? I just love all the different options there are for fall",

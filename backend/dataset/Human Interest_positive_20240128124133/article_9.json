The blue-ribbon booth highlighted the importance of quick responses during medical emergencies and the ways individuals can contribute by acquiring knowledge in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and bleeding control.\n“We support a healthy community,” Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said. “At the fair, we were able to teach people how they can help save lives. Now, the prize money from that effort will help comfort children who are fighting to beat cancer.”\nVentura County Health Care Agency (VCHCA) is comprised of two public hospitals, Ventura County Medical Center and Santa Paula Hospital, a network of primary and specialty care clinics, and Behavioral Health and Public Health Departments.\nCCCBD, a joint project with Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, is a specialty care clinic located at Ventura County Medical Center that provides state-of the-art pediatric care and consultation close to home for children and adolescents with cancer and blood diseases. CCCBD is the only pediatric cancer treatment facility for children and adolescents in Ventura County.\n“Through community partnership and generosity, we are able to offer so much more to our patients and their families receiving care. We are grateful to the Ventura County Fire Department for this donation, their investment in our health care system and support of our patients,” said Barry Zimmerman, Director of the VCHCA.\nAmy Towner, Chief Executive Officer of HCFVC is happy to engage in strategic philanthropic investments such as this to continue fostering health in Ventura County.

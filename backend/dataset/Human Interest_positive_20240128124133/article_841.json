Ciss has earned multiple accolades since joining the Jacks in 2022.\n\"We are excited to have Omar back for his third season with us,\" Head Coach Mike Jeffries expressed. \"His presence and ability to cover ground in the center of the field has been huge for our success the last two years. As a young player, his ability is reflected in being one of only a handful of players to make All-League selection in the past two years. I am confident Omar will continue to be an even bigger part of our makeup and identity as we head into 2024.\"\nCiss was one of six players to appear in all 35 matches for the Jacks in 2023. He totaled 3,061 minutes, starting all but one game. In the club's best season yet, Ciss recorded two goals, four assists, 149 recoveries, 133 duels won, 82 completed long passes and 28 chances created.\nHis consistency in the midfield earned Ciss a spot on the USL League One All-League Second Team and the honor of being named a USL League One Young Player of the Year Finalist. Ciss was included in the USL League One Team of the Week three times during the 2023 season.\nIn his debut season with the Independence, Ciss was also selected as a USL League One Young Player of the Year Finalist. The Senegal native additionally won 2022 USL League One Goal of the Year for an impressive long-range strike.\n\"I'm so happy to be back home,\" Ciss shared. \"This is my third season here, and I'm so ready to be looking for the championship this year. I can't wait to get started.\"\nCiss joins an already solid midfield full of returnees with Luis Alvarez, Rayan Djedje, and Bachir Ndiaye.\nThe 2024 season begins on Saturday, March 16 as the Charlotte Independence face One Knoxville SC in the home opener.

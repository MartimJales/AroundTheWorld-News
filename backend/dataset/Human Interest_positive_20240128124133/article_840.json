    "text": "Ormond Beach firefighters recall saving family's Christmas after car crashed into ditch It was Christmas Day when a mom and three kids were saved from a water-filled ditch in Daytona Beach. WESH spoke with the firefighters who responded to the accident. It was only Marc Pinknam's second shift. \"I just finished my first-week orientation last week,\" he said. Little did Marc Pinknam know that his Christmas Day shift at the Ormond Beach Fire Department would end the way it did. He and the team were dispatched to respond to a car that rolled over and fell into a water-filled ditch on Interstate 95.

You know, nerves were pretty high.\" Firefighter Dale Kelly has been with the department for 20 years. He knows this accident could've ended far worse. \"The car was in really rough shape that it bounced off a concrete pole before flipping several times,\" Kelly said. \"I think the family got very fortunate that the car landed upright where it did. You know, they would have been underwater.\" Some might even call this a Christmas miracle. Bystanders pulled the mom and three kids out of the car. When firefighters arrived, they had another important task. \"It started with the mother asking if there was any way we could try and find her cell phone,\" Kelly said. Responders set up a ladder to access the car and then noticed there were more things worth saving. Despite the water reaching the seats, firefighters pulled out about 20 gifts. The days on the job are never boring, especially during the holidays. \"Christmas is always pretty unique,\" Kelly said. \"You always get something during the holidays.\" Maybe next year, they get another good Christmas story to tell.",

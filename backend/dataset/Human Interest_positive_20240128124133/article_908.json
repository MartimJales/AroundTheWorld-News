    "text": "Glad tidings arrived just in time for the holiday season and the Hong Kong tourism sector. Crowds unseen in years have been showing up for a revamped night market on Temple Street as well as at one of the largest annual bazaars at Victoria Park.\\nAlthough locals made up the bulk of the turnout, large crowds at the Jordan market and Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in Causeway Bay have given the city and its pandemic-weary business sector sufficient reason to be optimistic.\\nThe expo, which features more than 900 booths offering bargain prices for food and other products, is expected to draw an overall attendance of 1 million visitors and sales of as much as HK$1 billion (US$127.9 million) during its 24-day run. With Covid-19 health rules no longer in place, a “food plaza” and taste-testing are back on the menu.\\nCuisine has also attracted visitors to the Temple Street market. It was overhauled as part of the government’s wider “Night Vibes Hong Kong” campaign to boost the nighttime economy.\\n\\nTourism Board officials said authorities would review footfall and the reactions of visitors to see if the bazaar should be extended past its initial six months. About 70 per cent of market visitors have been locals and 30 per cent tourists.\\nOrganisers hope word of its success will help gradually improve on that ratio.\\nOn his recent duty visit to Beijing, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu told mainland China officials that attracting more overnight visitors and boosting their spending in Hong Kong would be among his top priorities. Lee said the sector had recovered quickly since travel restrictions were lifted earlier this year.\\nThe Immigration Department expects Hong Kong to handle more than 9 million trips by people on the move over the Christmas and new year holidays. The Tourism Board and businesses are also offering discounts and vouchers during that time.\\nTasty debut as crowds flock to Hong Kong’s revamped Temple Street night market\\nChristmas is the peak season for retailers, and this year’s holiday is the first since borders reopened. Many Hongkongers have been heading to the mainland or overseas.\\nHowever, the buzz those who attended local events have created will hopefully attract people thinking of visiting the city over the festive season and beyond.\\n",

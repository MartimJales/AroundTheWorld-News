    "text": "With Alabama’s upcoming playoff game against Michigan fast approaching, star quarterback Jalen Milroe was asked by the press on Wednesday who his biggest inspiration and role model is.\nMilroe was quick to respond.\n“Jalen Hurts,” Milroe said.\n“Jalen Hurts was my true inspiration because through anything he always kept a smile on his face and a chip on his shoulder. Through everybody turning their back on him, he saw the bigger purpose in his future.”\nRELATED:\nTop 5 moments of Alabama’s 2023 season (so far)\n“He’s a man of faith,” the young Alabama quarterback continued. “You can’t beat a man that’s a man of faith.”\n“It’s hard to bring him down. That is someone that I love a lot and I have a connection with him. I consider him my brother.”\nJalen Milroe talks about who his biggest inspiration is\n[@abc3340] [pic.twitter.com/4XFVy7mcEf]\n— Chris McCulley (@ChrisMcCulleyTV)\n[December 27, 2023]\nMilroe added that the Philadelphia Eagles superstar shared an important piece of advice with him.\n“Keep the main thing the main thing,” Milroe relayed. “Before anyone had an opinion of me, I had a purpose… You’re going to have a lot of doubters, a lot of naysayers.”\n“The biggest thing you’ve got to do is keep going.”\nMilroe will have his biggest test yet on Monday, with the game scheduled for 4:00 CT.\nAccording to BetMGM and The Sporting News, number one ranked Michigan is the current betting favorite for the match up (-1.5).\nAusten Shipley is a staff writer for Yellowhammer News.\nDon’t miss out!\nSubscribe today to have Alabama’s leading headlines delivered to your inbox.",

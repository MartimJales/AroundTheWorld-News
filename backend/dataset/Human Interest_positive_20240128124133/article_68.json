    "text": "Pedro scored twice from the spot / Julian Finney/GettyImages GK: Jason Steele - 6/10 - Rarely tested by Spurs' attackers and dealt with anything that came into the box.\nRB: Jack Hinshelwood - 8/10 - Found space early on to blast Brighton in front. Physical with Son which helped subdue the South Korean.\nCB: Jan Paul van Hecke - 7/10 - Came close to scoring as his header hit the post. Generally competent throughout.\nCB: Lewis Dunk - 6/10 - Made the blunder which led to Son's goal and waited for Steele to claim a cross before Davies nodded in. Mainly fine otherwise.\nLB: Igor - 6/10 - Added more defensive beef on the left before his half-time withdrawal.\nCM: Pascal Gross - 8/10 - Added his trademark coolness in possession to proceedings, also making five tackles.\nCM: Billy Gilmour - 7/10 - Looked to shovel the ball out wide as quickly as possible when receiving possession.\nCM: James Milner - 7/10 - Came close to netting with a shot that came back off the post. Industrious as ever.\nAM: Facundo Buonanotte - 6/10 - Produced a great finish but had it chalked off for offside.\nST: Danny Welbeck - 8/10 - Might have scored with two good openings early on before being dragged down for Pedro's penalty.\nST: Joao Pedro - 9/10 - Strong run off the left before picking out Hinshelwood. Grabbed the ball and rolled in his side's second from the spot before bagging another in the second half.\nSubstitutes SUB: Pervis Estupinan (46' for Igor) - 7/10 - Brilliant strike from distance looked to have sealed a comfortable victory for the hosts, though Brighton eventually held on for victory.\nSUB: Carlos Baleba (59' for Buonanotte) - 5/10\nSUB: Jakub Moder (69' for Milner) - 5/10\nSUB: Evan Ferguson (69' for Welbeck) - 6/10\nSUB: Adam Lallana (90' for Pedro) - N/A\nSubs not used: Bart Verbruggen, Mahmoud Dahoud, Benicio Baker-Boaitey, Luca Barrington.\nManager Roberto De Zerbi - 8/10 - Exploited Tottenham's chasm in defence by playing to Welbeck and Pedro's strengths. Still gave up plenty of chances but that is to be expected.\nTottenham player ratings (4-2-3-1)\nVeliz scored his first Spurs goal / Bryn Lennon/GettyImages GK: Guglielmo Vicario - 7/10 - The only real defensive presence pulling his weight in the first half - he made four quality stops in the first 45 minutes.\nRB: Pedro Porro - 5/10 - Had a bit of a nightmare first half, even playing in Brighton namesake Pedro with a loose back-pass. Assisted Davies' header but a bad night overall.\nCB: Emerson Royal - 5/10 - Was errant positionally, sometimes chasing the ball in frustration and being caught out.\nCB: Ben Davies - 6/10 - Always shows commitment but was exposed by Brighton's raking passes over the top. Excellent desire to head in Porro's cross.\nLB: Destiny Udogie - 6/10 - Got sucked in too easily for the first goal. Quite standoffish in defence and lacked end product to accompany his threatening bursts.\nCM: Pape Matar Sarr - 5/10 - Overpowered by Brighton's sharp passing and couldn't display any box-to-box threat.\nCM: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 6/10 - Battled out of swarms of Brighton players at times and was often around to mop up loose ball. Might have further reduced the deficit but struck the post.\nRW: Brennan Johnson - 5/10 - Wasted a couple of chances when running in behind.\nAM: Dejan Kulusevski - 5/10 - Tugged down Welbeck for the penalty and will miss the next game against Bournemouth. Showed flashes of creativity but not enough.\nLW: Son Heung-min - 6/10 - Not overly involved in attack before setting up Veliz's consolation.\nST: Richarlison - 5/10 - Some nice centre-forward play saw Richarlison strike the outside of the post. However, he struggled to stay onside throughout.\nSubstitutes SUB: Giovani Lo Celso (65' for Sarr) - 6/10\nSUB: Bryan Gil (65' for Richarlison) - 5/10\nSUB: Alejo Veliz (70' for Johnson) - 7/10 - Bagged his first Premier League goal with a bit of a scruffy finish that gave Spurs a sniff.\nSubs not used: Fraser Forster, Eric Dier, Alfie Dorrington, Ashley Phillips, Yago Santiago, Jamie Donley.\nManager Ange Postecoglou - 5/10 - Certainly hamstrung by injuries and won't be changing much tactically, but did little to counter Brighton's evident ploy to go long.",

    "text": "Queen Camilla's sister tears up on Coronation Day\nPrince William practising his Coronation vow with King Charles III is going viral on social media.\nIt has emerged after the release of Charles III: The Coronation Year on Boxing Day.\nWilliam is meant to pledge his allegiance to his father and then kiss him on the cheek. During the rehearsal, William bends down and kisses Charles on the right side of his face, but it seems like Charles isn’t quite satisfied.\nWilliam then asks, “Oh, is it the left side?” before adding, “Your left cheek is better!”. He obliges, giving his father a second peck.\nThe moment has caught fans’ attention with the clip already amassing half a million views, 20,000 likes and 200 comments over at TikTok .\nREAD MORE: Prince Wiliam and Princess Kate unfazed by efforts to ‘wound’ with family put first\nThe actual Coronation took place on May 6, 2023. (Image: Getty) The scene begins with Charles sitting down and William standing in front of him. Charles is dressed in his everyday clothes, a suit, but has the cloak over his shoulders.\nWilliam, too, is dressed in a suit. He says part of the vow, but doesn’t finish it, saving the entire pledge for the big day.\nAnd, rather than actually touching the crown, he acts out the motion, and instead of kissing his father, he sort of tickles his face with his hand, but then does lean over to plant one on him.\n@princess__jo #royalfamily #fyp #viral #jdsummerdrip #booktok\noriginal sound - Jojo Trending Become an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial\nWilliam pledged his loyalty to King Charles on Coronation Day. (Image: Getty) At first, it appeared, he would just emulate the kiss and save it, like the vow, but, instead he went through with it.\nAnd, not just one kiss, but two.\nIt’s very rare for the public to see how the royals interact behind closed doors, and this is one of the reasons the documentary is being eagerly embraced.\nRelated articles Hollywood stars pay tribute to 'King of Breakfast' Bill Granger King Charles defies critics as BBC documentary is most watched on Boxing Day Prince William and King Charles 'rivalry' laid bare by Buckingham Palace insider King Charles is 'closer' to Princess Kate than Prince William, insider claims Follow Daily Express US\nFollow Daily Express US on Facebook and X (Image: EXPRESS) Get all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\nFollow Daily Express US on Facebook and Twitter @ExpressUSNews",

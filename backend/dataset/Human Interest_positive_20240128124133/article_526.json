    "text": "Coronation Street actor Tony Maudsley has revealed why soap bosses will never kill off his character George Shuttleworth.\nThe actor, 55, joined the hit ITV soap back in 2020 as undertaker George, the son of late undertaker Archie Shuttleworth. Tony appeared on Thursday's ITV special, The Big Soap Quiz: Coronation Street v Emmerdale .\nTony was joined by his Coronation Street co-stars, Channique Sterling-Brown, who plays Dee-Dee Bailey, and Jack P Shepherd, who plays David Platt. During the episode, host Stephen Mulhern asked Tony how is life for his character George in Weatherfield.\nTo which Tony quipped: \"Well, business is booming as always in Weatherfield. The best thing about playing George is, they can't kill me off because there's no one to bury me! So yeah, I'm staying put, me!\"\nBack in 2020 after it was announced Tony would be joining the cobbles as George, the actor said at the time on Twitter , now X: \"Yes I can indeed confirm this to be true. I’m chuffed to be staying at my ITV home and heading to Weatherfield and I for one, couldn’t be happier.\n\"As a long time fan of Coronation Street I’m thrilled to be joining the cast of my favourite show. Here’s to the next exciting chapter.\" Tony is best known for appearing in Benidorm from 2011 to 2018 as hairdresser Kenneth Du Beke but the sitcom, which first aired in 2007, was cancelled after 10 series. He also starred in Harry Potter And The Order of the Phoenix, voicing the character of Grawp, Hagrid’s giant brother.\nElsewhere on the quiz show, Tony's co-star, Channique Sterling-Brown, who plays Dee-Dee Bailey, revealed she auditioned for Emmerdale before landing her cobbles role.\nHost Stephen said: \"By the way, a little birdie tells me that you could of actually been on the other team tonight, is that right?\" in a nod to Emmerdale's team, made up of Natalie Ann Jamieson, who plays Amy Wyatt, Kevin Mathurin, who plays Charles Anderson, and Mark Charnock, who plays Marlon Dingle.\nChannique, 26, admitted: \"I could have been your daughter, Kevin!\" to which Emmerdale star Kevin replied: \"You're kidding!\" Stephen then explained: \"She auditioned\" to which Channique replied: \"Didn't get the job!\"\nKevin then responded: \"Oh well, it all happens for a good reason!\" to which Stephen quipped: \"Kevin seems gutted about that, literally he went: 'Oh well!'\", leaving the actor in hysterics.\nSoap watchers will recall that Karene Peter landed the role of Kevin's character, Charles Anderson's daughter Naomi Walters. Naomi made her first village debut back in July 2022 and left in July this year to live in Ibiza.\nCoronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV1 and ITV X. * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

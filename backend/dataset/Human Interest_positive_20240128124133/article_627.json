    "text": "Wyden and Merkley Announce Federal Investment of More Than $1 Million in Habitat for Humanity in Tillamook County Federal loan will help Habitat open ReStore retail operations in Tillamook County Washington D.C.— U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today announced a federal investment of more than $1.1 million for Habitat for Humanity in Tillamook to secure space for its retail operations and administrative offices. “In my town halls in Tillamook County and throughout the state, I hear from Oregon families and businesses that housing poses a huge challenge,” Wyden said. “Housing is a human right, and Habitat for Humanity has been on the frontline providing much-needed homes for Oregonians struggling to afford a roof over their heads. This investment will allow Habitat for Humanity to continue serving the citizens of Tillamook County for years to come.” “Everyone should have a safe, affordable place to call home. This federal investment heading to Habitat for Humanity in Tillamook County will help more rural Oregonians access quality housing,” said Sen. Merkley, who formerly led one of Habitat for Humanity's Oregon chapters. “I have seen firsthand the difference that accessible homeownership makes for families and the inspiring dedication of Habitat's staff and volunteers, who are working to realize a world where everyone has a decent home in a decent community.” The $1.13 million Rural Development loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be used to buy an 8,625-square-foot commercial facility for Habitat for Humanity of Tillamook County's ReStore's retail operations and the organization's administrative offices. Habitat for Humanity works with families, local communities, volunteers and partners to enable more people to live in affordable and safe homes. Its advocacy focuses on policy reform to remove systemic barriers preventing low-income and historically underserved families from having access to adequate, affordable shelter.

    "text": "In Mexico, just like in the majority of countries on earth, furry feline friends have made their way into the hearts and homes of millions! Just like anywhere else, the cats many consider their best friends and family deserve names that show their value! Whether its an especially intelligent kitty, or a cat who’s beauty deserves constant recognition! These wonderful pets deserve names and nicknames that show off their characters and personalities, just like people! So let’s dive in and take a look at a few different categories of amazing Mexican cat names! For as long as people have been keeping pets, naming them regular human names as a show of affection and appreciation of their complexity. In Mexico this is no different, and these wonderful Spanish and Mexican names are used for kitties! ©PippiLongstocking/Shutterstock.com Ángel – Literally translating to an angel, this name is common among men in Mexico. To use it for a boy cat makes perfect sense, especially for any cat friends that are especially adorable! Pedro Santiago – A more complex name for a ‘gentlemanly’ cat, for the boy cat that always keeps themselves clean and has a very picky appetite. If you’ve got a little prince for a kitty friend, this is the perfect high class name for you high class cat! Carmen – Carmen is a name that is used for both boys and girls in Mexican culture, and therefore can be used the same way for cats! Whether its boy or a girl cat, this name fits! Potentially perfect for a stray cat that you don’t know the sex of! Alejandro – A name long associated with romance has only been correlated stronger since the hit song by american pop icon Lady Gaga. So if you’ve got a boy cat that’s always meowing at the other kitties in town or constantly asking for pets from all your girl friends, Alejandro fits perfectly! Guadalupe – Another beautiful name for either a boy or girl in Mexican culture, the same goes for cats! Another good fit for an unspecified stray! Arturo – The Spanish counterpart for Arthur, a regal cat worthy of pulling the sword from the stone is fitting of this name! José – The spanish counterpart of joe, this name would go perfectly for a relaxed, chill cat that fits the ‘average joe’ stereotype! Gabriel – Another angelic name of biblical origins, this name fits a kitten or cat that saved their owner, often while being saved in the process themselves! Luis – The spanish counterpart of Louis, this name is perfect for well behaved boy cats that don’t cause their owners much trouble! Another gentlemanly name! For many of these names generally used for people, they seem to fit best for cats that have a deep understanding of the world around them! Always observing and working things out! The following names are perfect for these clever kitties! Ricardo Sebastián Carlos Victor Eduardo Fernando Felix Roberto Jorge Tito Hugo Rafael Pablo Diego Joaquín – A name recently brought back into the spotlight due to Joaquin Phoenix’s performance of the joker, a particular silly or jokester cat would perfectly fit this name! Mateo Javier Enzo Bruno Manuel Gonzalo Juan Hector Rodrigo Jesús – For the cats that appear into someone’s life and ‘saves’ them, there mustn’t be any better name than Jesus. Obviously referring to the messiah of the christian faith, the large number of christians in Mexico could very likely appreciate this name fitting a special cat! Ruben Ignacio César Fabio Nico Raúl Ivan Guillermo Francisco Dario Sergio – A name especially popular at the moment in Mexico due to Sergio Perez, a successful Mexican Formula 1 driver! If your cat is sprinting around and seeming to be a speed demon, this name would be the perfect fit for him! Miguel Antonio Alfonso For as long as people have been keeping boy cats, girl cats have received regular human names as well, as a similar show of affection and appreciation of their complexity! ©Rita_Kochmarjova/Shutterstock.com Isabella – A beautiful Spanish name with history steeped in royalty, this name fits best for female cats that seem to carry a majestic air! Expecting the best of service and showing discontent if disappointed! Luna – Translating to moon, this name fits best for female cats with beautiful white coats, or perhaps black cats with a white spot! Representing the moon shining in the night sky! Much like many of these popular people’s names being used for boy cats, these girl cats that fit people’s names also share the characteristics of intelligence and a seeming sophistication! For a kitty that smart , a name like ‘fluffy’ would never fit! Juanita Camila Elena Frida Jacinta Rosa – Translating to rose, this name would fit perfectly for a cat being gifted to a loved one! Representing the traditionally gifted rose! Gael Natalia Valentina – Another romance related name, this name would fit perfectly for a girl cat that shows lots of affection or is gifted between lovers. Lucia Andrés Renata Adela Bella – Particular fitting for a cat with striking beauty, the spanish translation of ‘beautiful’ would be a perfect name for a pretty cat! Lorena Lola Rocio Martina Carla Emilia Vega Marta Rita Eva Gloria – Another biblical name relating to heavenly or angelic characteristics. For those cats that have appeared and ‘saved’ their owner from a dark place, this name fits perfectly! Dolores Maria Selena Salma Paloma Vida Esperanza Yalitza Paulina Sofia Clara Josefina Inés Claudia Sylvia Maya Eiza Alma Valeria Ana While the affection pet owners have for their cats can’t be questioned due to this, some funny names for pets are popular in Mexico! Some of the names may seem slightly mean-spirited but just consider the common nicknames of ‘stinky’ and even ‘fatty’ for pets! These nicknames come from a place of endearment, as of course our pets can’t understand the literal meanings of our languages! Whether it be in English or Spanish, these funny names will always be popular with humorous pet owners! ©Nils Jacobi/iStock via Getty Images Gordo/a (fat) – Clearly being a good fit for the chubbier kitty friends, this name is a term of endearment! Sometimes cats just get a little bit too much for lunch and dinner! It’s nothing a bit of exercise and a diet can’t fit, a fun nickname like this is truly harmless! Flaco/a (skinny) – On the flip side of being a great name for bigger cat, the skinner guys would perfectly fit this name! Potentially a good fit for a cat brought in from the streets, those underfed friends might hold onto their nickname even after they gain weight! Picante (spicy) – Perfect for a cat with an extra bit of attitude, this name fits like a glove for the classic ‘angry’ cat! Smacking furiously with their paws and chomping down on ankles, these ‘spicy’ cats perfectly earned their name! Caliente (hot) – A similar fit to Picante, those cats with an extra bit of predator in their genes fit these names perfectly! Ready to heat up and attack at a moments notice, these cats are the type to leave your arms scratched up! Frijole (bean) Chico/a (boy/girl) Bonito/a (pretty) Gato/a (cat) Tanto/a (silly) Coraz ó n (heart) Guapo/a (handsome) Dinero (money) Bebé (baby) Niño/a (boy/girl) Loco/a (crazy) Some of the best names for cats come from another area where people have a lot of affection and various thoughts, food! It’s not entirely uncommon to hear a pet named after a type of food, or at least as a nickname, in the U.S. or elsewhere on earth! In Mexico, where they have countless unique and amazing types of food- its no different! Here are a bunch of food related nicknames for cats! With many of these words relating to a specific type of Mexican food, there’s no English words to translate them into! ©Svetlana Rey/Shutterstock.com Churro Taco Pepper Dulce Pico (Little) Queso (Cheese) Tajín Tamale Canela Flan Leche Elote Huevo Pozole Birria Chalupa Gordita Torta Taquito Tamarind Nacho Margarita Horchata Corona Modelo Cerveza Tecate Salsa Cholula Takis Considering how common red/orange/ginger cats are, and how unique their characters tend to be, having specified names is no surprise! ©iStock.com/Pijarn Jangsawang Rojo (red) Jengibre (ginger) Fuego (fire) Naranja (orange) Aurelia (golden) Briante (bright) The connotation and wives-tales about black cats make many view them as a dangerous omen of bad things! But those who have black cats know them to be sweet and adorable. These names are the perfect fit for these ‘mysterious’ black cats , who show their sweet side only to who they choose! ©NZ3/Shutterstock.com Regaliz (licorice) Oscuro (dark) Triste (sad) Secreto (secret) Noche (night) Miedo (scary) Many times a name for a cat will be as simple as ‘whiskers’ or ‘mittens’ (referring to their paws), utilizing a word related to cats to describe a specific furry friend. These Spanish/Mexican words are perfect for simple names for kitties! Some of these words refer to specific breeds of cat , while others are more overarching! ©Addicted04 / CC BY-SA 3.0 - License Abisinio: (El Gato Abisinio) Abyssinian cat Bigotes: whiskers Bufido: hiss Cola: tail Garras: claws Gatino/Gatina: Kitten (masculine/feminine) Gato/Gata: Cat (masculine/feminine) Miau: meow Ojos: eyes, perfect for a cat with big eyes Pelaje: fur Persa: (El gato persa de pelo largo) Persian cat Ronroneo: purr Ruso: (El Gato Azul Ruso) Russian Blue cat Siamés: (El Gato Siamés Tradicional) Siamese cat Trino: trill The post 169 Great Mexican Cat Names and Their Meanings appeared first on A-Z Animals .",

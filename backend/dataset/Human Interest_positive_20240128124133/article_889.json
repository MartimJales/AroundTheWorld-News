    "text": "COMMERCE TOWNSHIP, Mich. – The water temperature right now is in the 40s, but that’s not stopping one woman from jumping into the water every day in December. Each plunge raises money for charity. It’s all being done to spread mental health awareness, but how Kristina Camaj is doing it is pretty unique. “I wanted to do 31 Polar Plunges in 31 days in honor of the people that aren’t able to see 31 years old and in honor of the people who need our help,” Camaj said. For every day in December, Camaj is jumping into a body of water in the state of Michigan. It’s an effort to bring more attention to mental health and [the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention](https://afsp.org/). It’s a personal mission for Camaj, who lost her boyfriend to suicide. “If anyone has ever been through grief, they know that it’s ocean waves, right? It comes so strongly in your heart to where you are debilitated,” Camaj said. “It was hard. I was 22 years old when he passed away and we were together for over six years. So you know he was a huge part of my life. And he was my best friend.” Now she feels this is all she can do in hopes of saving the lives of others. Her mission, [Project Ice Woman](https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectIceWoman) has been so great, that many people have followed suit on several occasions, jumping into the water themselves. “We got 30 people to jump in the water altogether. Some were family members, some were strangers, some were neighbors,” Camaj said. “It was a dream come true. It was epic, honestly.” If anything, her wish would be just to change the life of one person. “If we’re able to help each other and lend a helping hand? Do it,” Camaj said. “A positive impact can go such a far way and that’s what I hope to be spreading, to not just Detroit, but the entire world.” She will be ending the month with her last jump on Sunday, Dec. 31, but she’s not stopping. “I’m going to keep going,” Camaj said. We want to honor those making a difference. [Click here to nominate someone who’s Going 4 It in your community](https://www.clickondetroit.com/go4it/#//).

    "text": "TUCSON, Ariz. (KVOA) —Pima Animal Care Center is looking for people to foster dogs temporarily over the New Year’s holiday. New Years sees an influx of pets when fireworks stress out animals which often causes them to run away. In early 2023, PACC took in 310 pets in the week following New Year’s. PACC hopes that short term fosters will help alleviate the influx. PACC is currently home to more than 465 dogs, placing the shelter beyond critical capacity. “The number of dogs in the shelter usually increases by about 50 in the week following New Year’s,” said Dangler. “By taking a pet home for even a short period, you can help both the dog you take home and the dog – or dogs – that fill that kennel next.” Those interested in fostering a dog for the holiday can pick up beginning Dec. 28 through Dec. 31. No pre-registration is needed; fosters can simply come to PACC to pick up any time during operating hours. Food, toys, blankets, and bowls are available from the foster office if needed, and anyone who commits to a minimum of a week will be entered in a raffle to win prizes. Returns will be scheduled beginning Jan. 8. If fosters decide they want to adopt or keep the pet as a long-term foster, PACC staff will be happy to help facilitate. PACC is located at 4000 N. Silverbell Road and is open on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from noon to 7 p.m., on Wednesday from 1:30 – 7 p.m., and on weekends from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The shelter will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on New Year’s Eve and closed on New Year’s Day.

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nSteak remains a modern-day culinary favorite due to its multifaceted appeal.\nIts robust flavor and tender texture cater to diverse taste preferences, offering a versatile dining experience with cuts like filet mignon and ribeye accommodating varied choices.\nThe cultural significance of steak as a symbol of indulgence and festivity contributes to its enduring popularity. Whether relished in upscale eateries or casual backyard grills, steak often accompanies special occasions, establishing itself as an iconic element in culinary traditions.\nThe influence of social media and culinary trends further amplifies steak's popularity. Visually appealing dishes shared online foster a collective appreciation for the culinary artistry involved in preparing steak. However, the best steakhouses can often be pricey.\nThat’s why Cheapism decided to find the yummiest steak in every state for the best prices :\n“In an era when a steak can easily top $50 at even modest venues, these dining establishments go beyond a chain-restaurant mentality and have rave customer reviews for their well-priced cuts that often come with generous extras or specials that offer savings off an otherwise hefty bill.” In Arizona, Rustler’s Rooste in Phoenix is where the least expensive yet most delicious steak can be tried:\n“You can beat the heat and enjoy a patio side view of the valley with a cool drink from the rustic saloon of Rustler’s Rooste. Make sure to order the Vaquero ($30), which comes with two enchiladas, or a Wrangler's bone-in rib-eye that can feed two at 20 ounces for $40.”",

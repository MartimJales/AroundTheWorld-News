    "text": "Earlier this month, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has always led Congress on energy development and environmental stewardship, wrapped up a visit to the international climate conference in the Middle East with fellow Republicans, as well as Democratic colleagues, to stand up for a smart American position on energy issues and the climate challenge. I’m glad she stepped up again and was there. How she sees her — and by extension Alaska’s —presence there, where decisions are made and plans are cast, makes a lot of sense to me. In her own words, “We must be involved because we are impacted. We see it, we face it and so we must be involved in the solutions.” “(CO P28) is where we can put a spotlight on the problem with real assignments as to how we can move forward in a more coordinated manner.” Meetings like COP happen with or without Republicans’ or Alaskans’ participation. The senator’s representation ensures the climate challenge is taken seriously and avoids unrealistic and unwise restrictions on energy development. Murkowski deserves our praise for securing a seat at the table. Thank you on behalf of students across the state, senator. I hope you continue stepping up and supporting bold, commonsense action on this critical issue. — Zoe Fencil Anchorage Have something on your mind?

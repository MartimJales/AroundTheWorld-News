Oglesby-Henry, a compelling and spiritually enriching Christian women’s fiction novel. This thought-provoking book, now available for readers worldwide, invites individuals to explore the transformative power of faith and personal choices.\nIn The Rose Who Blossomed Through the Concrete, Rosemary D. Oglesby-Henry shares a heartfelt narrative of her own life journey, portraying the struggles and obstacles she faced as she navigated the challenges of teenage parenthood and life’s adversities. This poignant story unveils the author’s spiritual awakening, demonstrating that one can find strength, healing, and purpose even in the midst of adversity.\nIn her own words, Rosemary says, “Oblivious and unconcerned with what was happening, I allowed the pitfalls of life to form in what I thought was a perfect garden. I learned that you cannot mend a spiritual wound with human tools. Thus, God left my garden covered by concrete.”\nThe Rose Who Blossomed Through the Concrete calls on girls, women, and mothers to transform their faltering faith into a source of spiritual growth and healing. Rosemary’s testimony serves as an inspirational beacon, encouraging each reader to view their choices and their consequences as opportunities to draw closer to God, uncover their life’s purpose, and ultimately flourish.\nAbout the Author:\nRosemary D.

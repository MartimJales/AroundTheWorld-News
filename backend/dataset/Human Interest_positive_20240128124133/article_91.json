    "text": "Coronation Street fans were stunned by the ageless looks of legendary star Steven Arnold - who played butcher Ashley Peacock - as he appeared 13 years after his character's death on The Big Soap Quiz: [Coronation Street](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street) v [Emmerdale](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/emmerdale). Stephen Mulhern was hosting the [ITV](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/itv) show as stars from the two soaps went head to head to discover who knew the most about their show. Steven, 49, was the answer to one of the questions and appeared in the studio to the delight of soap fans. And viewers were shocked to see he hadn't changed much at all since his days playing the much-loved butcher. Steven first appeared on the cobbles as Ashley in 1995. His character was killed off in 2010 when he was a victim of a tram crash as part of the show's 50th-anniversary special episode.

But he was raised by Fred's sister Beryl Peacock, played by Anny Tobin, and her husband Sam as their own son. Ashley grew up believing Fred was his uncle and Beryl was his mother. But viewers were distracted by his youthful appearance and took to X, formerly Twitter, to comment. Dawn said: \"Ashley has not changed at all.\" Simon Ramsay agreed: \"Stephen Arnold/Ashley hasn't changed much considering the number of years, and Malandra Burrows looks stunning! I hope she's well #TheBigQuiz #Emmerdale #Corrie.\" Speaking about his time on the show, Steven said being partnered with John was 'the best thing', adding 'he taught me everything I know'. He added: \"I did 15 years and if you're in a programme for that length of time it's always going to be in your heart.\" Since leaving Coronation Street in 2010, Steven has enjoyed more success in several different TV roles, while also working as a producer. However, he has since found his passion on stage, after working more than ‘40-odd stage jobs’. He appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2011 and has also appeared in Casualty as well as Thick As Thieves and On The Market, and he has worked on countless short films since leaving Coronation Street. And Corrie wasn't his first acting role. Steven and his younger brother, Kevin, both appeared in the Granada Television series Children's Ward.",

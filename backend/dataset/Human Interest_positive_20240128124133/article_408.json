    "text": "Every day this December, Playbill will be getting into the spirit of the season with 31 Days of Holiday Cheerâ€”sharing some of our favorite music videos from Broadway stars. Check in daily for classic tunes and new songs about Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year's. And we even have some surprise new, original Playbill videos to share.\nThe a cappella group Pentatonix recorded Fleet Foxes' \"White Winter Hymnal\" for their 2014 album That's Christmas to Me. A recent performance on Good Morning America has the song on loop in our heads again. The lyrics are a little abstract, and possibly even morbid. But hey, it's about winter and they mention snow and the group put it on a Christmas album, so we're including it in our holiday video series. Plus it just sounds so cool! Accompanied by only their slaps, snaps, and claps, check out Pentatonix singing \"White Winter Hymnal\" in the video above.\nMembers of Pentatonix are Scott Hoying, Mitch Grassi,\nKirstin Maldonado, Matt Sallee, and Kevin Olusola. Formed in 2011, the group has released 12 studio albums (including several Christmas albums). They have three Grammy Awards; two for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella and one for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for their collaboration with Dolly Parton on her song \"Jolene.\"\nMaldonado made her Broadway debut in 2018 in\nKinky Boots as Lauren, following several Broadway favorites in the role, including Annaleigh Ashford, Jeanna de Waal, and Taylor Louderman.\nPentatonix can currently be seen in the 2023 Christmas film Candy Cane Lane on Amazon Prime (they play carolers turned into tiny figurines by an evil elf). Eddie Murphy and Tracee Ellis Ross star, along with an appearance from Tony winner\nDavid Alan Grier as Santa. VIDEO: 31 Days of Holiday Cheer: The Original Hadestown Fates Sing 'Sleigh Ride'",

    "text": "Hollywood actress Emma Stone has revealed she has a soft spot for British TV, and is 'completely crazy' for programmes like Gogglebox and Naked Attraction.\nThe actress, who is known for her roles in Spiderman, Easy A and La La Land, said her love of British TV began by watching reality show The Only Way Is Essex at first. Yet she then discovered X-rated show Naked Attraction and Gogglebox, which she described as 'cosy family viewing followed by nakedness'.\nThe star, who will be appearing in saucy flick Poor Things which airs next month, made the unexpected confession during an appearance on BBC One's The Graham Norton Show, which will air on New Year's Eve.\nSpeaking on The Graham Norton Show, she said: \"My foray into it began with The Only Way Is Essex of course and then I learned all about Naked Attraction and Gogglebox. I became completely crazy about it and in America the two shows are a double feature. They are back-to-back so it’s cosy family viewing followed by nakedness. I love that!\"\nEmma also discussed her new role in upcoming flick Poor Things where she plays Bella Baxter. Emma plays reanimated corpse turned Frankenstein’s monster Bella in the new film as she embarks on a journey of sexual discovery and self-actualisation. It involves plenty of racy scenes, including Bella getting down and dirty with an apple and confessing she’s been a “whore”.\nIn an interview with Polygon, director Yorgos Lanthimos praised Emma for her portrayal of Bella as he said she \"brought the sex and optimism\" to the film. He said: \"What we wanted to do is deal with [sex] the same way that [we] dealt with anything else, like the same way that the character Bella doesn’t have any shame about anything, and no preconceived notions about anything. It’s the same with her about sex.\n\"So she had to feel no shame, and just explore it and experience it the same way she experiences food, or whatever else. And some of it is pleasing, and some of it she wants to spit out.\"\nThe racy scenes come after Emma has previously admitted that 'nothing is off limits' when she works with Yorgos, as she chatted to her pal Bradley Cooper for Variety’s Actors on Actors series. She explained: \"That rehearsal process was so helpful because we all got to know each other so well. All you do in a rehearsal with Yorgos is like, mess around. You play theatre games, it’s not literal at all – you’re not reading the scenes and working out how they’re going to go. It’s very playful – you’re a human noodle or you’re doing log rolls or whatever. Really fun things where you kind of embarrass yourself.\"\nThe Graham Norton New Year’s Eve Show airs on Sunday December 31 at 10.25pm on BBC One.\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",
